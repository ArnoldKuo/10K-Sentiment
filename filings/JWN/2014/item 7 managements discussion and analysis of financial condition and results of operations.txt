result in the loss of our competitive position if these technologies and investments do not perform as expected or are not seamlessly integrated our profitability and growth could be adversely affected in addition if we do not maintain our current systems we may see interruptions to our business and increased costs in order to bring our systems up to datewe are continuing our plan to accelerate the number of new nordstrom rack store openings new store openings both at the rack and in our fullline stores involve certain risks including the availability of suitable locations constructing furnishing and supplying a store in a timely and costeffective manner and properly balancing our capital investments between new stores remodels technology and ecommerce in addition we may not accurately assess the demographic or retail environment for a particular location and sales at new relocated or remodeled stores may not meet our projections particularly in light of the changing trends between online and brickandmortar shopping channels which could adversely affect our return on investment we also intend to open stores in new and international markets such as canada puerto rico and manhattan and expansion will require additional management attention and resources and may distract us from executing our core operations in addition competition from strong local competitors compliance with foreign and local laws and regulatory requirements and potentially unfavorable tax consequences may cause our business to be adversely impactedas we execute our plans and continue to evolve and transform our strategy we may not adequately manage the related organizational changes to align with our strategy or appropriately monitor report or communicate the changes in

on the experience of our senior management who have specific knowledge relating to us and our industry that is difficult to replace and the talents of our workforce to execute our business strategies and objectives if unexpected turnover occurs without adequate succession plans the loss of the services of any of these individuals or any resulting negative perceptions of our business could damage

significant damage to our reputation could negatively impact sales diminish customer trust reduce employee morale and productivity and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employeesrisks due to economic and external market factorsa downturn in economic conditions could have a significant adverse effect on our business during economic downturns fewer customers may shop for the highquality items in our stores and on our websites as they may be seen as discretionary and those who do shop may limit the amount of their purchases this reduced demand may lead to lower sales higher markdowns and increased marketing and promotional spending deterioration of economic conditions and consumer confidence may also adversely affect our credit customers payment patterns and delinquency rates increasing our bad debt expenseour business could suffer if we do not appropriately assess and react to competitive market forces and changes in customer behavior we compete with other national regional local and online retailers that may carry similar lines of merchandise including department stores specialty stores offprice stores boutiques and internet businesses the retail environment is rapidly evolving with customer shopping preferences continuing to shift online and we expect competition in the ecommerce market to intensify in the future as the internet facilitates

value fashion newness quality of products depth of selection convenience fulfillment service and the shopping experience including the online and store environment and location our financial model is

we do not identify and respond to emerging trends in consumer spending and preferences quickly enough we may harm our ability to retain our existing customers or attract new customers if we purchase

additional sales and damage our relationships with our customersthe results of our credit operations could be adversely affected by changes in market conditions our credit card revenues and profitability are subject in large part to economic and market conditions that are beyond our control including but not limited to interest rates consumer credit availability consumer debt levels unemployment trends laws and regulations and other factors these economic and market conditions could impair our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers if the criteria andor models we use to underwrite and manage our customers become less predictive of future losses this could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operationsour business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by supply chain disruptions severe weather patterns natural disasters widespread pandemics and other natural or manmade disruptions we derive a significant amount of our total sales from stores located on the west and east coasts of the united states particularly in california which increases our exposure to conditions in these regions these disruptions could cause among other things a decrease in consumer spending that would negatively impact our sales staffing shortages in our stores distribution centers or corporate offices

longterm growth plans risks due to legal and regulatory factorswe are subject to certain laws litigation regulatory matters and ethical standards and our failure to comply with or adequately address

state tax laws which may increase our tax liabilities an increase in our tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations we are also regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business and financial conditionwe continue to face uncertainties due to financial services industry regulation and supervision that could have an adverse affect on our operations federal and state regulation and supervision of the financial industry has increased in recent years due to implementation of consumer protection and financial reform legislation such as the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 card act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 financial reform act the financial reform act significantly restructured regulatory oversight and other aspects of the financial industry created the bureau of consumer financial protection cfpb to supervise and enforce consumer lending laws and regulations and expanded state authority over consumer lending the card act included new and revised rules and restrictions on credit card pricing finance charges and fees customer billing practices and payment application we anticipate more regulation and interpretations of the new rules to continue and depending on the nature and extent of these new regulations and interpretations we may be required to make changes to our credit card practices and systems which could adversely impact the revenues and profitability of our credit segment in addition we operate in a regulated environment where financial supervisory agencies provide oversight over our activities if we fail to comply with

occupancy costs related to our nordstrom racks accelerated store expansion the nordstrom rewards loyalty program continues to play an important role in reaching new customers and strengthening existing customer relationships the growth in nordstrom rack stores resulted in a higher occupancy expense as sales volume at new stores typically take several years to reach the average of our mature

537 times in 2012 this was primarily due to our increased investment in pack and hold inventory at nordstrom rack which helped fuel the growth in that channel we began increasing our pack and hold inventory investment in 2012 which involves the acquisition of merchandise from some of our top brands in advance of the upcoming selling seasons in order to take advantage of strategic buying opportunities we hold this inventory in our warehouses for six months on average until the next selling season and it represented approximately 11 9 and 3 of our total inventory at the end of 2013

relative to the increase in sales per square foot was primarily due to the impact of the 53rd week in 2012 which decreased inventory levels in our fullline stores and included an additional week of

in fiscal 2012 outpacing the adjusted increase in sales per square foot this was primarily attributable to the planned investment in pack and hold inventory at nordstrom rack which represented 11 of

estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates the following discussion highlights the estimates we believe are critical and should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures that followallowance for credit lossesthe allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of the losses inherent in our credit card receivables as of the balance sheet date including uncollectible finance charges and fees we estimate such credit losses based on several factors including historical aging and delinquency trends writeoff experience portfolio concentration and risk metrics and general economic conditionswe believe the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card receivables under current conditions however significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above could materially change these expectations during 2013 our delinquency and net writeoff results continued to improve as a result we reduced our allowance for credit losses by 5 during 2013 from 85 to 80 and by 30 in 2012 from 115 to 85 a 10 change in our allowance for credit losses would have affected net earnings by approximately 5 for the fiscal year ended february 1 201432table of contentsrevenue recognitionwe recognize revenue from sales at our retail stores at the point of sale net of an allowance for estimated sales returns revenue from sales to customers shipped directly from our stores website and catalog which includes shipping revenue when applicable is recognized upon estimated receipt by the customer we estimate customer merchandise returns based on historical return patterns and reduce sales and cost of sales accordinglyalthough we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of sales returns there is a possibility that actual returns could differ from recorded amounts in the past three years there were no significant changes in customer behavior and we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of our sales return reserve a 10 change in the sales return reserve would have had an 8 impact on our net earnings for the year ended february 1 2014inventoryour merchandise inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market value using the retail inventory method under the retail method the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory the value of our inventory on the balance sheet is then reduced by a charge to cost of sales for retail inventory markdowns taken on the selling floor to determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down we consider current and anticipated demand customer preferences age of the merchandise and fashion trends inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management judgments that may affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross marginwe reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification our obsolescence reserve contains uncertainties as the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors including market conditions the selling environment historical results and current inventory trendswe do not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience in the past three years we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of the obsolescence reserve a 10 change in the obsolescence reserve would have had no material impact on our net earnings for the year ended february 1 2014goodwillwe review our goodwill annually for impairment or when circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level comprised of the principal business units within our retail segment to assess the fair value of our hautelook goodwill we utilize both an income approach and a market approach to determine the fair value of goodwill related to nordstromcom and jeffrey we utilize a market approach we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwillas part of our impairment testing we utilize certain assumptions and apply judgment regarding a number of factors significant estimates in the market approach include identifying similar companies and acquisitions with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return of investment and assessing comparable earnings or revenue multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit assumptions in the income approach include future cash flows for the business future growth rates and discount rates estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to the business model or changes in operating performance for nordstromcom and jeffrey the fair values substantially exceeded carrying values and therefore we had no goodwill impairment in 2013 2012 or 2011 in 2011 the year we acquired hautelook we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of 25 in 2013 and 2012 our testing indicated that the fair value of hautelook substantially exceeded the carrying value and therefore we did not record goodwill impairment for 2013 or 2012 a 10 change in the fair value of any of our reporting units would not have had an impact on our net earnings for the fiscal year ended february 1 2014 income taxeswe regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal state and foreign filings by considering all relevant facts circumstances and
