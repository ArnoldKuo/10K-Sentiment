maintain our current systems we may see interruptions to our business and increased costs in order to bring our systems up to datewe are continuing our plan to accelerate the number of new nordstrom rack store openings new store openings both at the rack and in our fullline stores involve certain risks including the availability of suitable locations constructing furnishing and supplying a store in a timely and costeffective manner and properly balancing our capital investments between new stores remodels technology and ecommerce in addition we may not accurately assess the demographic or retail environment for a particular location and sales at new relocated or remodeled stores may not meet our projections particularly in light of the changing trends between online and brickandmortar shopping channels which could adversely affect our return on investment we also intend to open stores in new and international markets such as canada puerto rico and manhattan and expansion will require additional management attention and resources and may distract us from executing our core operations in addition competition from strong local competitors compliance with foreign and local laws and regulatory requirements and potentially unfavorable tax consequences may cause our business to be adversely impactedas we execute our plans and continue to evolve and transform our strategy

market factorsa downturn in economic conditions could have a significant adverse effect on our business during economic downturns fewer customers may shop for the highquality items in our stores and on our websites as they may be seen as discretionary and those who do shop may limit the amount of their purchases this reduced demand may lead to lower sales higher markdowns and increased marketing and promotional spending deterioration of economic conditions and consumer confidence may also adversely affect our credit customers payment patterns and delinquency rates increasing our bad debt expenseour business could suffer if we do not appropriately assess and react to competitive market forces and changes in customer behavior we compete with other national regional local and online

programs large banks and other credit card companies some of which have substantial financial resources if we do not effectively anticipate or respond to the competitive banking and credit card environments we could lose market share to our competitorsour sales and customer relationships may be negatively impacted if we do not anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends appropriatelyour ability to predict or respond to constantly changing fashion trends consumer preferences and spending patterns significantly impacts our sales and operating results if we do not identify and respond to emerging trends in consumer spending and preferences quickly enough we may harm our ability to retain our existing customers or attract new customers if we purchase too much

sales and damage our relationships with our customersthe results of our credit operations could be adversely affected by changes in market conditions our credit card revenues and profitability are subject in large part to economic and market conditions that are beyond our control including but not limited to interest rates consumer credit availability consumer debt levels unemployment trends laws and regulations and other factors these economic and market conditions could impair our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers if the criteria andor models we use to underwrite and manage our customers become less predictive of future losses this could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operationsour business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by supply chain disruptions severe weather patterns natural disasters widespread pandemics and other natural or manmade disruptions we derive a significant amount of our total sales from stores located on the west and east coasts of the united states particularly in california which increases our exposure to conditions in these regions these disruptions could cause among other things a decrease in consumer spending that would negatively impact our sales staffing shortages in our stores distribution centers or corporate offices interruptions in the flow of merchandise to our stores disruptions in the operations of our merchandise vendors or property developers increased costs and a negative impact on our reputation and longterm growth plans risks due to legal and regulatory factorswe are subject to certain laws litigation regulatory matters and ethical standards and our failure to comply with or adequately address developments as they arise could adversely affect our reputation and operations our policies procedures and practices and the technology we implement are designed to comply with federal state local and foreign laws rules and regulations including those imposed by the sec and other regulatory agencies the marketplace the banking industry and foreign countries as well as responsible business social and environmental practices all of which may change from time to time significant legislative changes including those that relate to employment matters and health care reform could impact our relationship with our workforce which could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or implement responsible business social and environmental practices we could be subject to damage to our reputation class action lawsuits legal and settlement costs civil and criminal liability increased cost of regulatory compliance restatements of our financial statements disruption of our business and loss of customers any required changes to our employment practices could result in the loss of employees reduced sales increased employment costs low employee morale and harm to our business and results of operations in addition political and economic factors could lead to unfavorable changes in federal and state tax laws which may increase our tax liabilities an increase in our tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations we are also regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business and financial conditionwe continue to face uncertainties due to financial services industry regulation and supervision that could have an adverse affect on our operations federal and state regulation and supervision of the financial industry has increased in recent years due to implementation of consumer protection and financial reform legislation such as the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 card act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 financial reform act the financial reform act significantly restructured regulatory oversight and other aspects of the financial industry created the bureau of consumer financial protection cfpb to supervise and enforce consumer lending laws and regulations and expanded state authority over consumer lending the card act included new and revised rules and restrictions on credit card pricing finance charges and fees customer billing practices and payment application we anticipate more regulation and interpretations of the new rules to continue and depending on the nature and extent of these new regulations and interpretations we may be required to make changes to our credit card practices and systems which could adversely impact the revenues and profitability of our credit segment in addition we operate in a regulated environment where financial supervisory agencies provide oversight over our activities if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could face enforcement actions from these agencies which could have an adverse impact on us8table of contentsitem 1b unresolved staff commentsnone
