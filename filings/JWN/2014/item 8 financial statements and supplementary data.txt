shop in stores or through ecommerce if we target the wrong opportunities fail to make investments at the right time or speed fail to make the best investments in the right channels or make an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs it may result in the loss of our competitive position if these technologies and investments do not perform as expected or are not seamlessly integrated our profitability and growth could be adversely affected in addition if we do not maintain our current systems we may see interruptions to our business and increased costs in order to bring our systems up to datewe are continuing our plan to accelerate the number of new nordstrom rack store openings new store openings both at the rack and in our fullline stores involve certain risks including the availability of suitable locations constructing furnishing and supplying a store in a timely and costeffective manner and properly balancing our capital investments between new stores remodels technology and ecommerce in addition we may not accurately assess the demographic or retail environment for a particular location and sales at new relocated or remodeled stores may not meet our projections particularly in light of the changing trends between online and brickandmortar shopping channels which could adversely affect our return on investment we also intend to open stores in new and international markets such as canada puerto rico and manhattan and expansion will require additional management attention and resources and may distract us from executing our core operations in addition competition from strong local competitors compliance with foreign and local laws and regulatory requirements and potentially unfavorable tax consequences may cause our business to be adversely impactedas we execute our plans and continue to evolve and transform our strategy we may not adequately manage the related organizational changes to align with our strategy or appropriately monitor report or communicate the changes in an effective manner in addition we may not gather accurate and relevant data or effectively utilize that data which may impact our strategic

talent and future leaders our business may suffer we rely on the experience of our senior management who have specific knowledge relating to us and our industry that is difficult to replace and the talents of our workforce to execute our business strategies and objectives if unexpected turnover occurs without adequate succession plans the loss of the services of any of these individuals or any resulting negative perceptions of our business could damage our reputation and our businesseven if we take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from

implement to prevent a security or cybersecurity threat may not be totally effective and may have the potential to harm relations with our customers or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use in addition the regulatory environment surrounding information security cybersecurity and privacy is increasingly demanding with new and constantly changing requirements security

difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employeesrisks due to economic and external market factorsa downturn in economic conditions could have a significant adverse effect on our business during economic downturns fewer customers may shop for the highquality items in our stores and on our websites as they may be seen as discretionary and those who do shop may limit the amount of their purchases this reduced demand may lead to lower sales higher markdowns and increased marketing and promotional spending deterioration of economic conditions and consumer confidence may also adversely affect our credit customers payment patterns and delinquency rates increasing our bad debt expenseour business could suffer if we do not appropriately assess and react to competitive market forces and changes in customer behavior we compete with other national regional local and online retailers that may carry similar lines of merchandise including department stores specialty stores offprice stores boutiques and internet businesses the retail environment is rapidly evolving with customer shopping preferences continuing to shift online and we expect competition in the ecommerce market to

negative impact on our results of operationsour business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by supply chain disruptions severe weather patterns natural disasters widespread pandemics and other natural or manmade disruptions we derive a significant amount of our total sales from stores located on the west and east coasts of the united states particularly in california

unfavorable changes in federal and state tax laws which may increase our tax liabilities an increase in our tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations we are also regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business and financial conditionwe continue to face uncertainties due to financial services industry regulation and supervision that could have an adverse affect on our operations federal and state regulation and supervision of the financial industry has increased in recent years due to implementation of consumer protection and financial reform legislation such as the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 card act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 financial reform act the financial reform act significantly restructured regulatory oversight and other aspects of the financial industry created the bureau of consumer financial protection cfpb to supervise and enforce consumer lending laws and regulations and expanded state authority over consumer lending the card act included new and revised rules and restrictions on credit card pricing finance charges and fees customer billing practices and payment application we anticipate more regulation and interpretations of the new rules to continue and depending on the nature and extent of these new regulations and interpretations we may be required to make changes to our credit card practices and systems which could adversely impact the revenues and profitability of our credit segment in addition we operate in a regulated environment where financial supervisory agencies provide oversight over our activities if we

contentsour inventory turnover rate decreased to 507 times in 2013 from 537 times in 2012 this was primarily due to our increased investment in pack and hold inventory at nordstrom rack which helped

selling seasons in order to take advantage of strategic buying opportunities we hold this inventory in our warehouses for six months on average until the next selling season and it represented

compared with 2012 the increase in ending inventory per square foot relative to the increase in sales per square foot was primarily due to the impact of the 53rd week in 2012 which decreased inventory levels in our fullline stores and included an additional week of sales in 2012 in 2013 we also planned inventory increases in fullline stores to fuel growth in wellperforming merchandise categories and increased our pack and hold inventory at nordstrom rackgross profit  2012 vs 2011 our retail gross profit rate decreased 38 basis points compared with 2011 primarily due to accelerated nordstrom

compared with the same period in fiscal 2012 outpacing the adjusted increase in sales per square foot this was primarily attributable to the planned investment in pack and hold inventory at nordstrom

incorporates nordstrom racks accelerated store expansion and increased technology investments to improve service and experience across all channels these expenses are expected to contribute to our overall increase in depreciation and rent expense of 14 compared with 2013interest expense net is expected to decrease primarily due to a onetime charge of 14 related to the debt refinancing

accounting estimatesthe preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates the following discussion highlights the estimates we believe are critical and should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures that followallowance for credit lossesthe allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of the losses inherent in our credit card receivables as of the balance sheet date including uncollectible finance charges and fees we estimate such credit losses based on several factors including historical aging and delinquency trends writeoff experience portfolio concentration and risk metrics and general economic conditionswe believe the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card receivables under current conditions however significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above could materially change these expectations during 2013 our delinquency and net writeoff results continued to improve as a result we reduced our allowance for credit losses by 5 during 2013 from 85 to 80 and by 30 in 2012 from 115 to 85 a 10 change in our allowance for credit losses would have affected net earnings by approximately 5 for the fiscal year ended february 1 201432table of contentsrevenue recognitionwe recognize revenue from sales at our retail stores at the point of sale net of an allowance for estimated sales returns revenue from sales to customers shipped directly from our stores website and catalog which includes shipping revenue when applicable is recognized upon estimated receipt by the customer we estimate customer merchandise returns based on historical return patterns and reduce sales and cost of sales accordinglyalthough we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of sales returns there is a possibility that actual returns could differ from recorded amounts in the past three years there were no significant changes in customer behavior and we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of our sales return reserve a 10 change in the sales return reserve would have had an 8 impact on our net earnings for the year ended february 1 2014inventoryour merchandise inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market value using the retail inventory method under the retail method the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory the value of our inventory on the balance sheet is then reduced by a charge to cost of sales for retail inventory markdowns taken on the selling floor to determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down we consider current and anticipated demand customer preferences age of the merchandise and fashion trends inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management judgments that may affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross marginwe reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification our obsolescence reserve contains uncertainties as the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors including market conditions the selling environment historical results and current inventory trendswe do not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience in the past three years we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of the obsolescence reserve a 10 change in the obsolescence reserve would have had no material impact on our net earnings for the year ended february 1 2014goodwillwe review our goodwill annually for impairment or when circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level comprised of the principal business units within our retail segment to assess the fair value of our hautelook goodwill we utilize both an income approach and a market approach to determine the fair value of goodwill related to nordstromcom and jeffrey we utilize a market approach we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwillas part of our impairment testing we utilize certain assumptions and apply judgment regarding a number of factors significant estimates in the market approach include identifying similar companies and acquisitions with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return of investment and assessing comparable earnings or revenue multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit assumptions in the income approach include future cash flows for the business future growth rates and discount rates estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to the business model or changes in operating performance for nordstromcom and jeffrey the fair values substantially exceeded carrying values and therefore we had no goodwill impairment in 2013 2012 or 2011 in 2011 the year we acquired hautelook we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of 25 in 2013 and 2012 our testing indicated that the fair value of hautelook substantially exceeded the carrying value and therefore we did not record goodwill impairment for 2013 or 2012 a 10 change in the fair value of any of our reporting units would not have had an impact on our net earnings for the fiscal year ended february 1 2014 income taxeswe regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal state and foreign filings by considering all relevant facts circumstances and information available to us if we believe it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained we recognize a benefit at the largest amount that we believe is cumulatively greater than 50 likely to be realized our unrecognized tax benefit was 14 as of february 1 2014 and 15 as of february 2

affect our interest income credit card revenues and interest expense see note 3 accounts receivable in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional informationwe use sensitivity analyses to measure and assess our interest rate risk exposure for purposes of presenting the potential earnings effect of a reasonably possible hypothetical change in interest rates from our reporting date we utilized two sensitivity scenarios i linear growth of approximately 225 basis points over the year and ii linear decline of approximately 15 basis points over the year due to the fact that current interest rates are near historically low levels other key parameters and assumptions in our sensitivity analyses include the average cash and cash equivalents balance average credit card receivables balance and no new floating rate debt the first hypothetical scenario would result in an approximate 21 increase in future earnings while the second hypothetical scenario would not have a material effect on future earningsfor our longterm fixedrate debt of 3113 our exposure to interest rate risk is limited to changes in the fair value of our debt as our debt is fixedrate changes in interest rates do not impact our cash flows however changes in interest rates increase or decrease the fair value of our debt depending on whether market rates are lower or higher than our

likelihood of redemption based on historical experience is deemed to be remote based on an analysis of our program since its inception in 1999 we determined that balances remaining on cards issued beyond five years are unlikely to be redeemed and therefore may be recognized as income breakage income was 9 10 and 9 in 2013 2012 and 2011 to date our breakage rate is approximately 30 of the amount

receivableaccounts receivable includes credit card receivables from our nordstrom private label and visa credit cards as well as credit and debit card receivables due from thirdparties we record credit card receivables on our consolidated balance sheets at the outstanding balance net of an allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of the losses inherent in our receivables as of the balance sheet date including uncollectible finance charges and fees we estimate such credit losses based on several factors including historical aging and delinquency trends writeoff experience concentration and risk metrics and general economic conditions for purposes of determining impairment and recording the associated allowance for credit losses we evaluate our credit card receivables on a collective basis as they are composed of large groups of smallerbalance homogeneous loans and therefore are not individually evaluated for impairment we record estimated uncollectible principal balances to bad debt expense while estimated uncollectible finance charges and fees result in a reduction of credit card revenue credit card receivables constitute unsecured consumer loans for which the risk of cardholder default and associated credit losses tend to increase as general economic conditions deterioratewe consider a credit card account delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the payment due date our aging method is based on the number of completed billing cycles during which the customer has failed to make a minimum payment delinquent accounts including accrued finance charges and fees are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible usually after they become 150 days past due accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikelywe recognize finance charges and fees on delinquent accounts until they become 120 days past due after which we place accounts on nonaccrual status payments received for accounts on nonaccrual status are applied to accrued finance charges fees and principal balances consistent with other accounts with subsequent finance charge income recognized only when actually received nonaccrual accounts may return to accrual status when we receive three consecutive minimum payments or the equivalent lump sumour nordstrom private label credit card can be used only at nordstrom fullline stores nordstrom rack stores and online at nordstromcom while our nordstrom visa cards allow our customers the option of using the cards for purchases of nordstrom merchandise and services as well as for purchases outside of nordstrom cash flows from the use of both the private label and nordstrom visa credit cards for sales originating at our stores and our website are treated as an operating activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows as they relate to sales at nordstrom cash flows arising from the use of nordstrom visa cards outside of our stores are treated as an investing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows as they represent loans made to our customers for purchases at third partiesmerchandise inventoriesmerchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail method weightedaverage cost under the retail method the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory the value of our inventory on the balance sheet is then reduced by a charge to cost of sales for retail inventory markdowns taken on the selling floor to determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down we consider current and anticipated demand customer preferences age of the merchandise and fashion trends we reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification land buildings and equipmentland is

acquired and is not subject to amortization as of february 1 2014 we had hautelook goodwill of 121 and nordstromcom and jeffrey goodwill of 53 we review our goodwill annually for impairment or when circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable we review our hautelook goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter and review our nordstromcom and jeffrey goodwill on the first day of the first quarter we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level comprised of the principal business units within our retail segment through the application of a twostep fair value test the first step compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value which is based on the expected present value of future cash flows income approach comparable public companies and acquisitions market approach or a combination of both if fair value is lower than the carrying value then a second step is performed to quantify the amount of the impairment to assess the fair value of our hautelook goodwill we utilize both an income approach and a market approach to determine the fair value of goodwill related to nordstromcom and jeffrey we utilize a market approachwhen facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of longlived assets including buildings equipment and amortizable intangible assets may be impaired we perform an evaluation of recoverability by comparing the carrying values of the net assets to their related projected undiscounted future cash flows in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses upon indication that the carrying values of longlived assets will not be recoverable we recognize an impairment loss we estimate the fair value of the assets using the expected present value of future cash flows of the assets land buildings and equipment are grouped at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment cash flows for our retail store assets are identified at the individual store level while our intangible assets associated with hautelook are identified at the hautelook reporting unit level we did not record any material impairment losses for longlived

liability claims liabilities associated with these losses include undiscounted estimates of both losses reported and losses incurred but not yet reported we estimate our ultimate cost based on an actuarially based analysis of claims experience regulatory changes and other relevant factorsderivativesduring 2011 we held interest rate swap agreements collectively the swap which were intended to hedge our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixedrate senior notes due in 2018 from interest rate risk the swap was designated as a fully effective fair value hedge in the fourth quarter of 2011 we sold our swap and received proceeds of 72 which was recorded on the sale date as an accumulated adjustment to our longterm debt and will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt the cash flows from the sale of our swap are treated as a financing activity within our consolidated statements of cash flows see note 8 debt and credit facilities for additional information related to our swapforeign currencywe have announced plans to open six fullline stores in canada beginning in 2014 the functional currency of our canadian operations is the canadian dollar we translate assets and liabilities into us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date while we translate revenues and expenses using a weightedaverage exchange rate for the period we record these translation adjustments as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets in addition our us operations incurred certain expenditures denominated in canadian dollars and our canadian operations incurred certain expenditures denominated in us dollars this activity results in transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations and are recorded as gains or losses in the consolidated statements of earnings as of february 1 2014 activities associated with the future store openings have not

assets of 62 and goodwill of 146 offset by other net liabilities of 13 we amortize the intangible assets over their estimated lives of two to seven years on a straightline basis which reasonably approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit we recorded intangible amortization expense of 10 for 2013 and 19 for 2012the goodwill value of 146 recorded at the time of the acquisition was the excess of the purchase price over the net assets recognized we include this goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes in our retail segment in 2011 we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 25 reducing the hautelook goodwill to 121 due to a reorganization of hautelook changes in expected business results and market dynamics additionally as part of the reorganization we recorded

are payable in either cash or stock as elected by the employee therefore they are classified as a liability award the liability is remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to earnings at each fiscal quarterend during the performance cycle the performance share unit liability is remeasured using the estimated percentage of units earned multiplied by the closing market price of our common stock on the current periodend date and is prorated based on the amount of time passed in the vesting period the price used to determine the amount of cash received for the performance share units upon vesting
