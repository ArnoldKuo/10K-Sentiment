acting together they may be able to exercise considerable influence over matters requiring shareholder approval as reported in our periodic filings our board of directors has from time to time authorized share repurchases while these share repurchases may be offset in part by share issuances under our equity incentive plans and as consideration for acquisitions the repurchases may

store and onlineprior to october 1 2015 interest expense at the credit segment was equal to the amount of interest related to securitized debt plus an amount assigned to the credit segment in proportion to the estimated debt and equity needed to fund our credit card receivables based on our research debt as a percentage of credit card receivables for other credit card companies ranges from 70 to 90 as such we considered a mix of 80 debt and 20 equity to be appropriate and therefore assigned interest expense to the credit segment as if it carried debt of up to 80 of the credit card receivables subsequent to the sale we no longer allocate interest expense to the credit segment as we do not fund the accounts receivable now owned by tdfiscal year 2015 2014 2013credit card revenues
