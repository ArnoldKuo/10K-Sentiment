store and onlineprior to october 1 2015 interest expense at the credit segment was equal to the amount of interest related to securitized debt plus an amount assigned to the credit segment in proportion to the estimated debt and equity needed to fund our credit card receivables based on our research debt as a percentage of credit card receivables for other credit card companies ranges from 70 to 90 as such we considered a mix of 80 debt and 20 equity to be appropriate and therefore assigned interest expense to the credit segment as if it carried debt of up to 80 of the credit card

while nordstrom visa credit cards also may be used for purchases outside of nordstrom cash flows from the use of both the private label and nordstrom visa credit cards for sales originating at our stores and our website are treated as an operating activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows as they relate to sales at nordstrom prior to the credit card receivable transaction we treated cash flows arising from the use of nordstrom visa credit cards outside of our stores as an investing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows as they represented loans made to our customers for purchases at third parties merchandise inventoriesmerchandise inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market value using the retail inventory method weightedaverage cost under the retail method the valuation of inventories are determined by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory the value of our inventory on the balance sheet is then reduced by a charge to cost of sales for retail inventory markdowns taken on the selling floor to determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down we consider current

value of the related net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization as of january 30 2016 we had trunk club goodwill of 261 hautelook goodwill of 121 and nordstromcom and jeffrey goodwill of 53 we review our goodwill annually for impairment or when circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level comprised of the principal business units within our retail segment through the application of a twostep fair value test the first step compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value which is based on the expected present value of future cash flows income approach comparable public companies and acquisitions market approach or a combination of both if fair value is lower than the carrying value then a second step is performed to quantify the amount of the impairment longlived assetswhen facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of longlived assets including buildings equipment and amortizable intangible assets may be impaired we perform an evaluation of recoverability by comparing the carrying values of the net assets to their related projected undiscounted future cash flows in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses land property and equipment are grouped at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment cash flows for our retail store assets are identified at the individual store level while our intangible assets associated with hautelook and trunk club are identified at their respective reporting unit levels the assets recorded in connection with the credit card receivable transaction are individually evaluated against the anticipated cash flows under the program agreement see note 2 credit card receivable transactionin 2015 our cash flow analyses resulted in retail store impairment charges of 24 and other various impairment losses of 23 the retail store impairment of

of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets in addition our us operations incur certain expenditures denominated in canadian dollars and our canadian operations incur certain expenditures denominated in us dollars this activity results in transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations and are recorded as gains or losses in the consolidated

pronouncementsin may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which was subsequently modified in august 2015 by asu no 201514 revenue from contracts with customers deferral of the effective date the core principle of asu no 201409 is that companies should recognize revenue when the transfer of promised goods or services to customers occurs in an amount that reflects what the company expects to receive it requires additional disclosures to describe the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers this guidance is now effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018 we are currently evaluating the impact the provisions would have on our consolidated financial statementsin november 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201517 income taxes  balance sheet classification of deferred taxes this asu requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial position the change simplifies classification and reporting by eliminating the identification of net current and net noncurrent deferred tax assets or liabilities we elected to early adopt this asu resulting in a reclassification of our current deferred tax assets net to longterm deferred tax assets net included within other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of january 30 2016 we have implemented the guidance on a prospective basis therefore prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases this asu increases transparency and comparability by recognizing a lessees rights and obligations resulting from leases by recording them on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities the new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee this classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straightline basis over the term of the lease this asu is effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2019 though we are currently evaluating the impact of these provisions we expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statementsnote 2 credit card receivable transactionon october 1 2015 we completed the sale of a substantial majority of our us visa and private label credit card portfolio to td

executive officers as one of the ways to align compensation with shareholder interests performance share units are earned after a threeyear performance cycle only when our total shareholder return reflecting daily stock price appreciation and compounded reinvestment of dividends outperforms companies in a defined group of competitors determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors performance share units granted in 2013 also require the total shareholder return to be positive for any payout the percentage of units that are earned depends on our relative position at the end of the performance cycle and can range from 0 to 175 of the number of units grantedbecause performance share units are payable in either cash or stock as elected by the employee they are classified as a liability award the liability is remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to earnings at each fiscal quarterend during the performance cycle the performance share unit liability is remeasured using the estimated percentage of units earned multiplied by the closing market price of our common stock on the current periodend date and is prorated based on the amount of time that has passed in the vesting period the price used to determine the amount of cash or stock settled for the performance share units upon vesting is the closing market price of our common stock on the last

incentivize trunk club employees to increase the value of the trunk club business the vcp has three payout scenarios that are determined based on the trunk club business meeting minimum or exceeding maximum 2018 sales and earnings metrics if the minimum is not met the payout is 0 outcome a if the maximum is met the payout is 100 outcome b if the sales and earnings metrics surpass the minimum but do not reach the maximum the payout is based on the incremental value growth of the trunk club business since acquisition and will be between 0 and 100 outcome c we estimate the grant date fair value for each outcome and recognize expense based upon outcome c deemed most probable if at any time it becomes probable that another outcome will be achieved compensation expense will be cumulatively
