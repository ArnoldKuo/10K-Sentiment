risks we believe the risks described below outline the items of most concern to usrisks due to strategic and operational factorsour strategic growth plans focus on both our stores and on ecommerce and failure to successfully execute our plans could negatively impact our current business and future profitability we plan to accelerate the number of new nordstrom rack store openings new store openings both at the rack and in our fullline stores involve certain risks including the availability of suitable locations constructing furnishing and supplying a store in a timely and costeffective manner and accurately assessing the demographic or retail environment for a particular location in addition sales at new relocated or remodeled stores may not meet our projections which could adversely affect our return on investment we also intend to open stores in new and international markets such as canada puerto rico and manhattan and expansion will require additional management attention and resources and may distract us from executing our core operations in addition competition from strong local competitors compliance with foreign and local laws and regulatory requirements and potentially unfavorable tax consequences may cause our business to be adversely impacted6table of contentswe are also enhancing our customer shopping experience in our stores online and in mobile and

without adequate succession plans the loss of the services of any of these individuals or any negative perceptions of our business as a result could damage our reputation and our businesswe could expose our customers and our business to risk if we fail to take the appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breachesour operations involve the

effect on our business during economic downturns fewer customers may shop for the highquality items in our stores and on our website as they may be seen as discretionary and those who do shop may

changing fashion trends consumer preferences and spending patterns significantly impacts our sales and operating results if we do not identify and respond to emerging trends in consumer spending and preferences quickly enough we may harm our ability to retain our existing customers or attract new customers if we purchase too much inventory we may be forced to sell our merchandise at lower average margins which could harm our business conversely if we fail to purchase enough merchandise we may lose opportunities for additional sales and damage our relationships with our customersthe results of our credit operations could be adversely affected by changes in market conditions our credit card revenues and profitability are subject in large part to economic and market conditions that are beyond our control including but not limited to interest rates consumer credit availability consumer debt levels unemployment trends laws and regulations and other factors these economic and market conditions could impair our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers if the criteria andor models we use to underwrite and manage our customers become less predictive of future losses this could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operationsour business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by supply chain disruptions severe weather patterns natural disasters widespread pandemics and other natural or manmade disruptions we derive a significant amount of our total sales from stores located on the west and east coasts of the united states particularly in california which increases our exposure to conditions in these regions these disruptions could cause among other things a decrease in consumer spending that would negatively impact our sales staffing shortages in our stores distribution centers or corporate offices interruptions in the flow of merchandise to our stores disruptions in the operations of our merchandise vendors or property developers increased costs and a negative impact on our reputation and longterm growth plans risks due to legal and regulatory factorswe are subject to certain laws

agencies the marketplace the banking industry and foreign countries as well as responsible business social and environmental practices all of which may change from time to time significant legislative changes including those that relate to employment matters and health care reform could impact our relationship with our workforce which could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations

our results of operations we are also regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business and financial condition8table of contentsour business faces uncertainties as we implement newly enacted financial system reforms that could have an adverse affect on our operations the recession resulted in increased legislative and regulatory changes affecting the financial industry the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 included new rules and restrictions on credit card pricing finance charges and fees customer billing practices and payment application which required us to make changes to our credit card practices and systems we expect more regulations and interpretations of the new rules to emerge and depending on the nature and extent of the full impact from these rules the revenues and profitability of our credit segment could be adversely affected in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was enacted in july 2010 it significantly restructures regulatory oversight and other aspects of the financial industry creates a new federal agency to supervise and enforce consumer lending laws and regulations and expands state authority over consumer lending numerous regulations will be issued in the near future to implement the requirements of this act which remain uncertain at this time depending on the nature and extent of these regulations and the enforcement approach of regulators under

investments in new stores and remodeling of existing stores our gross profit rate decreased 13 basis points compared with 2011 primarily due to accelerated rack growth which carries a lower gross profit rate relative to our other channels and overall occupancy costs that outpace sales in the early years following a store opening with racks high sales productivity and return on invested capital as well as the availability of what we believe are numerous quality locations we plan to continue to grow our rack channelour inventory turnover rate decreased to 537 times in 2012 from 556 times in

upcoming selling seasons in order to take advantage of strategic buying opportunities we hold this inventory in our warehouses for six months on average until the next selling season and it represents

apparel and shoes were the leading categories for nordstrom rackgross profitour total company gross profit rate was flat compared with the same period in the prior year markdown improvements were offset by higher expenses associated with our enhanced fashion rewards program which generated incremental sales and attracted new members our ending inventory per square foot increased 158 on an 111 increase in sales per square foot compared with the fourth quarter of 2011 the increase in ending inventory per square foot relative to the increase in sales per square foot is primarily due to our increased investment in pack and hold inventory associated with racks growthselling general amp administrative expensesselling general and administrative expenses for our retail business increased 94 compared with last years fourth quarter the increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volume and the opening of 16 new stores since the fourth quarter of 2011 the increase also reflected our initiatives to improve the customer experience across all channels including higher planned fulfillment expenses our retail sgampa rate decreased 45 basis points due to leverage on increased sales partially offset by increases in fulfillment costs associated with improving the speed of delivery for shipped sales in the fourth quarter selling general and administrative expenses for our credit segment were 53 down from 58 in 2011 the decrease was primarily driven by lower bad debt expense resulting from continued improvements in delinquencies and writeoff results within our portfoliofor

28 2012 our roic increased compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in our earnings before interest and income tax expense we believe that roic is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating our operating performance when analyzed in conjunction with our net earnings and total assets and compared with return on assets net earnings divided by average total assets it provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and our management of assets from period to period roic is one of our key financial metrics and we also incorporate it into our executive incentive measures we believe that overall performance as measured by roic correlates directly to shareholders return over the long term roic is not a measure of financial performance under gaap should not be considered a substitute for return on assets net earnings or total assets as determined in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by

access to a variety of shortterm and longterm sources of funding and we rely on these funding sources to continue to grow our business we believe a higher ratio among other factors could result in

ebitdar was 21 compared with 24 as of january 28 2012 the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in debt and an increase in earnings before interest and income taxes for the 12 months ended

highlights the estimates we believe are critical and should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures that followallowance for credit lossesthe allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of the losses inherent in our credit card receivables as of the balance sheet date including uncollectible finance charges and fees we estimate such credit losses based on several factors including historical aging and delinquency trends writeoff experience portfolio concentration and risk metrics and general economic conditionswe believe the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card receivables under current conditions however significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above could materially change these expectations during 2012 our delinquency and net writeoff results continued to improve as a result we reduced our allowance for credit losses by 30 during 2012 from 115 to 85 and by 30 during 2011 from 145 to 115 a 10 change in our allowance for credit losses would have affected net earnings by 5 for the fiscal

sales to customers shipped directly from our stores website and catalog which includes shipping revenue when applicable is recognized upon estimated receipt by the customer we estimate customer merchandise returns based on historical return patterns and reduce sales and cost of sales accordinglyalthough we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of sales returns there is a possibility that actual returns could differ from recorded amounts in the past three years we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of our sales return reserve a 10 change in the sales return reserve would have had a 7 impact on our net earnings for the year ended february 2 2013inventoryour merchandise inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market value using the retail inventory method under the retail method the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory the value of our inventory on the balance sheet is then reduced by a charge to cost of sales for retail inventory markdowns taken on the selling floor to determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down we consider current and anticipated demand customer preferences age of the merchandise and fashion trends inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management judgments that may affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross marginwe reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification our obsolescence reserve contains uncertainties as the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors including market conditions the selling environment historical results and current inventory trendswe do not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience in the past three years we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of the obsolescence reserve a 10 change in the obsolescence reserve would have had no material impact on our net earnings for the year ended february 2 2013goodwillwe review our goodwill annually for impairment or when circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level comprised of the principal business units within our retail segment to assess the fair value of our hautelook goodwill we utilize both an income approach and a market approach to determine the fair value of goodwill related to nordstromcom and jeffrey we utilize a market approach we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwillas part of our impairment testing we utilize certain assumptions and apply judgment regarding a number of factors significant estimates in the market approach include identifying similar companies and acquisitions with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return of investment and assessing comparable earnings or revenue multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit assumptions in the income approach include future cash flows for the business future growth rates and discount rates estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to the business model or changes in operating performance based on the results of our 2012 review we did not recognize an impairment loss for goodwill based on the results of our 2011 review we recognized an impairment charge of 25 related to our hautelook goodwill a 10 change in the fair value of any of our reporting units would not have had an impact on our net earnings for the fiscal year ended february 2 2013income taxeswe regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal state and foreign filings by considering all relevant facts circumstances and information available to us if we believe it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained we recognize a benefit at the largest amount that we believe is cumulatively greater than 50 likely to be realized our unrecognized tax benefit was 15 as of february 2 2013 and 21 as of january 28 2012unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances also as audits are completed or statutes of limitations lapse it may be necessary to record

financial statements and supplementary data for additional informationwe use sensitivity analyses to measure and assess our interest rate risk exposure for purposes of presenting the potential earnings effect of a reasonably possible hypothetical change in interest rates from our reporting date we utilized two sensitivity scenarios i linear growth of approximately 170 basis points over the year and ii linear decline of approximately 20 basis points over the year due to the fact that current interest rates are at or near historically low levels other key parameters and assumptions in our sensitivity analyses include the average cash and cash equivalents balance average credit card receivables balance and no new floating rate debt issuance the first hypothetical scenario would result in an approximate 16 increase in future earnings while the second hypothetical scenario would not have a material effect on future earningsfor our longterm fixedrate debt of 3131 our exposure to

as credit and debit card receivables due from thirdparty financial institutions we record credit card receivables on our consolidated balance sheets at the outstanding balance net of an allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of the losses inherent in our receivables as of the balance sheet date including uncollectible finance charges and fees we estimate such credit losses based on several factors including historical aging and delinquency trends writeoff experience concentration and risk metrics and general economic conditions credit card receivables constitute unsecured consumer loans for which the risk of cardholder default and associated credit losses tend to increase as general economic conditions deterioratewe consider a credit card account delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the payment due date our aging method is based on the number of completed billing cycles during which the customer has failed to make a minimum payment delinquent accounts including accrued finance charges and fees are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible usually after they become 150 days past due accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikelywe recognize finance charges and fees on delinquent accounts until they become 120 days past due after which we place accounts on nonaccrual status payments received for accounts on nonaccrual status are applied to accrued finance charges fees and principal balances consistent with other accounts with subsequent finance charge income recognized only when actually received nonaccrual accounts may return to accrual status when we receive three consecutive minimum payments or the equivalent lump sumour nordstrom private label credit card can be used only in our nordstrom fullline and rack stores and on our website while our nordstrom visa cards allow our customers the option

for sales originating at our stores and our website are treated as an operating activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows as they relate to sales at nordstrom cash flows arising from

at third partiesmerchandise inventoriesmerchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail method weightedaverage cost under the retail method the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory the value of our inventory on the balance sheet is then reduced by a charge to cost of sales for retail inventory markdowns taken on the selling floor to determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down we consider current and

acquired and is not subject to amortization as of february 2 2013 we had hautelook goodwill of 121 and nordstromcom and jeffrey goodwill of 53 we review our goodwill annually for impairment or when circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable we review our hautelook goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter and review our nordstromcom and jeffrey goodwill on the first day of the first quarter we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level comprised of the principal business units within our retail segment through the application of a twostep fair value test the first step compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value which is based on the expected present value of future cash flows comparable public companies and acquisitions or a combination of both if fair value is lower than the carrying value then a second step is performed to quantify the amount of the impairment for nordstromcom and jeffrey the fair values substantially exceeded carrying values and therefore we had no goodwill impairment in 2012 2011 or 2010 in 2011 the year we acquired hautelook we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of 25 in 2012 our testing indicated that the fair value of hautelook substantially exceeded the carrying value and therefore we did not record goodwill impairment for 2012 when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of longlived assets including buildings equipment and amortizable intangible assets may be impaired we perform an evaluation of recoverability by comparing the carrying values of the net assets to their related projected undiscounted future cash flows in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses upon indication that the carrying values of longlived assets will not be recoverable we recognize an impairment loss we estimate the fair value of the assets using the expected present value of future cash flows of the assets land buildings and equipment are grouped at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment cash flows for our retail store assets are identified at the individual store level while our intangible assets associated with hautelook are identified at the hautelook reporting unit level we did not record an impairment loss for longlived tangible or amortizable intangible assets in 2012 2011 or 2010selfinsurancewe retain a portion of the risk for certain losses related to employee health and welfare workers compensation and general liability claims liabilities associated with these losses include undiscounted estimates of both losses reported and losses incurred but not yet reported we estimate our ultimate cost based on an actuarially based analysis of claims experience regulatory changes and other relevant factorsderivativesduring 2011 we held interest rate swap agreements collectively the swap which were intended to hedge our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixedrate senior notes due in 2018 from interest rate risk the swap was designated as a fully effective fair value hedge as such the interest rate swap fair value was included in other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of our longterm debt included in other unsecured debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 we sold our swap and received proceeds of 72 the accumulated adjustments to the associated debt of 60 as of february 2 2013 are being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt the cash flows from the sale of our swap are treated as a financing activity within our consolidated statement of cash flows see note 8 debt and credit facilities for additional information related to our swaprecent accounting pronouncementsin december 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201111 disclosures about offsetting assets and

disclosureonly in nature it requires disclosures about offsetting and related arrangements for certain financial instruments and derivative instruments including gross and net information and

due to their shortterm nature we also estimate on a nonrecurring basis the fair value of our longterm debt including current maturities and the remaining fair value adjustment from our previous

estimated the fair value of longterm debt using quoted market prices of the same or similar issues and as such this is considered a level 2 fair value measurementwe also measure certain nonfinancial

performance share units vest after a threeyear period only when our total shareholder return reflecting daily stock price appreciation and compounded reinvestment of dividends is positive and

the end of the vesting period and can range from 0 to 175 of the number of units grantedperformance share units are payable in either cash or stock as elected by the employee therefore they are classified as a liability award the liability is remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to earnings at each fiscal quarterend during the vesting period the performance share unit liability is
