current business and future profitability we plan to accelerate the number of new nordstrom rack store openings new store openings both at the rack and in our fullline stores involve certain risks including the availability of suitable locations constructing furnishing and supplying a store in a timely and costeffective manner and accurately assessing the demographic or retail environment for a particular location in addition sales at new relocated or remodeled stores may not meet our projections which could adversely affect our return on investment we also intend to open stores in new and

patterns significantly impacts our sales and operating results if we do not identify and respond to emerging trends in consumer spending and preferences quickly enough we may harm our ability to retain our existing customers or attract new customers if we purchase too much inventory we may be forced to sell our merchandise at lower average margins which could harm our business conversely if we fail to purchase enough merchandise we may lose opportunities for additional sales and damage our relationships with our customersthe results of our credit operations could be adversely affected by changes in market conditions our credit card revenues and profitability are subject in large part to economic and market conditions that are beyond our control including but not limited to interest rates consumer credit availability consumer debt levels unemployment trends laws and regulations and other factors these economic and market conditions could impair our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers if the criteria andor models we use to underwrite and manage our customers become less predictive of future losses this could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operationsour business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by supply chain disruptions severe weather patterns natural disasters widespread pandemics and other natural or manmade disruptions we derive a significant amount of our total sales from stores located on the west and east coasts of the united states particularly in california which increases our exposure to conditions in these regions these disruptions could cause among other things a decrease in consumer spending that would negatively impact our sales staffing shortages in our stores distribution centers or corporate offices interruptions in the flow of merchandise to our stores disruptions in the operations of our merchandise vendors or property developers increased costs and a negative impact on our reputation and longterm growth plans risks due to legal and regulatory factorswe are subject to certain laws litigation regulatory matters and ethical standards and our failure to comply with or adequately address developments as they arise could adversely affect our reputation and operations our policies procedures and practices and the technology we implement are designed to comply with federal state local and foreign laws rules and regulations including those imposed by the sec and other regulatory agencies the marketplace the banking industry and foreign countries as well as responsible business social and environmental practices all of which may change from time to time significant legislative changes including those that relate to employment matters and health care reform could impact our relationship with our workforce which could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or implement responsible business social and environmental practices we could be subject to damage to our reputation class action lawsuits legal and settlement costs civil and criminal liability increased cost of regulatory compliance restatements of our financial statements disruption of our business and loss of customers any required changes to our employment practices could result in the loss of employees reduced sales increased employment costs low employee morale and harm to our business and results of operations in addition political and economic factors could lead to unfavorable changes in federal and state tax laws which may increase our tax liabilities an increase in our tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations we are also regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business and financial condition8table of contentsour business faces uncertainties as we implement newly enacted financial system reforms that could have an adverse affect on our operations the recession resulted in increased legislative and regulatory changes affecting the financial industry the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 included new rules and restrictions on credit card pricing finance charges and fees customer billing practices and payment application which required us to make changes to our credit card practices and systems we expect more regulations and interpretations of the new rules to emerge and depending on the nature and extent of the full impact from these rules the revenues and profitability of our credit segment could be adversely affected in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was enacted in july 2010 it significantly restructures regulatory oversight and other aspects of the financial industry creates a new federal agency to supervise and enforce consumer lending laws and regulations and expands state authority over consumer lending numerous regulations will be issued in the near future to implement the requirements of this act which remain uncertain at this time depending on the nature and extent of these regulations and the enforcement approach of regulators under the new law there could be an adverse impact to

as well as the availability of what we believe are numerous quality locations we plan to continue to grow our rack channelour inventory turnover rate decreased to 537 times in 2012 from 556 times in

provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and our management of assets from period to period roic is one of our key financial metrics and we also incorporate it into our executive incentive measures we believe that overall performance as measured by roic correlates directly to shareholders return over the long term roic is not a measure of financial performance under

access to a variety of shortterm and longterm sources of funding and we rely on these funding sources to continue to grow our business we believe a higher ratio among other factors could result in rating agency downgrades in contrast we believe a lower ratio would result in a higher cost of capital and could negatively impact shareholder returns as of february 2 2013 our adjusted debt to ebitdar was 21 compared with 24 as of january 28 2012 the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in debt and an increase in earnings before interest and income taxes for the 12 months ended

that followallowance for credit lossesthe allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of the losses inherent in our credit card receivables as of the balance sheet date including uncollectible finance charges and fees we estimate such credit losses based on several factors including historical aging and delinquency trends writeoff experience portfolio concentration and risk metrics and general economic conditionswe believe the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card receivables under current conditions however significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above could materially change these expectations during 2012 our delinquency and net writeoff results continued to improve as a result we reduced our allowance for credit losses by 30 during 2012 from 115 to 85 and by 30 during 2011 from 145 to 115 a 10 change in our allowance for credit losses would have affected net earnings by 5 for the fiscal

sales to customers shipped directly from our stores website and catalog which includes shipping revenue when applicable is recognized upon estimated receipt by the customer we estimate customer merchandise returns based on historical return patterns and reduce sales and cost of sales accordinglyalthough we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of sales returns there is a possibility that actual returns could differ from recorded amounts in the past three years we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of our sales return reserve a 10 change in the sales return reserve would have had a 7 impact on our net earnings for the year ended february 2 2013inventoryour merchandise inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market value using the retail inventory method under the retail method the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory the value of our inventory on the balance sheet is then reduced by a charge to cost of sales for retail inventory markdowns taken on the selling floor to determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down we consider current and anticipated demand customer preferences age of the merchandise and fashion trends inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management judgments that may affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross marginwe reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification our obsolescence reserve contains uncertainties as the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors including market conditions the selling environment historical results and current inventory trendswe do not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience in the past three years we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of the obsolescence reserve a 10 change in the obsolescence reserve would have had no material impact on our net earnings for the year ended february 2 2013goodwillwe review our goodwill annually for impairment or when circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level comprised of the principal business units within our retail segment to assess the fair value of our hautelook goodwill we utilize both an income approach and a market approach to determine the fair value of goodwill related to nordstromcom and jeffrey we utilize a market approach we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwillas part of our impairment testing we utilize certain assumptions and apply judgment regarding a number of factors significant estimates in the market approach include identifying similar companies and acquisitions with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return of investment and assessing comparable earnings or revenue multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit assumptions in the income approach include future cash flows for the business future growth rates and discount rates estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to the business model or changes in operating performance based on the results of our 2012 review we did not recognize an impairment loss for goodwill based on the results of our 2011 review we recognized an impairment charge of 25 related to our hautelook goodwill a 10 change in the fair value of any of our reporting units would not have had an impact on our net earnings for the fiscal year ended february 2 2013income taxeswe regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal state and foreign filings by considering all relevant facts circumstances and information

realized our unrecognized tax benefit was 15 as of february 2 2013 and 21 as of january 28 2012unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their
