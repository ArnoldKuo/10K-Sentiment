merchandise to our stores disruptions in the operations of our merchandise vendors or property developers increased costs and a negative impact on our reputation and longterm growth plans risks due to legal and regulatory factorswe are subject to certain laws litigation regulatory matters and ethical standards and our failure to comply with or adequately address developments as they arise could

regulations including those imposed by the sec and other regulatory agencies the marketplace the banking industry and foreign countries as well as responsible business social and environmental

enacted financial system reforms that could have an adverse affect on our operations the recession resulted in increased legislative and regulatory changes affecting the financial industry the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 included new rules and restrictions on credit card pricing finance charges and fees customer billing practices and payment application which required us to make changes to our credit card practices and systems we expect more regulations and interpretations of the new rules to emerge and depending on the nature and extent of the full impact from these rules the revenues and profitability of our credit segment could be adversely affected in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was enacted in july 2010 it significantly restructures regulatory oversight and other aspects of the financial industry creates a new federal agency to supervise and enforce consumer lending laws and regulations and expands state authority over consumer lending numerous regulations will be issued in the near future to implement the requirements of this act which remain uncertain at this time depending on the nature and extent of these regulations and the enforcement approach of regulators under the new law there could be an adverse impact to our credit segment
