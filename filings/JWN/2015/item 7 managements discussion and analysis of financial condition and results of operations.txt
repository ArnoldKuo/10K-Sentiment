for a particular location and sales at new relocated or remodeled stores may not meet our projections particularly in light of the changing trends between online and brickandmortar shopping channels which could adversely affect our return on investment we also intend to open stores in new and international markets such as canada puerto rico and manhattan and expansion will require additional

anne e gittinger and members of the nordstrom family within our executive team in our proxy statement as of march 2 2015 for the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders these individuals owned an aggregate of approximately 27 of our common stock as a result either individually or acting together they may be able to exercise considerable influence over matters requiring shareholder approval as reported in our periodic filings our board of directors has from time to time authorized share repurchases while these share repurchases may be offset in part by share issuances under our equity incentive plans and as consideration for acquisitions the repurchases may nevertheless have the effect of increasing the overall percentage ownership held by these shareholders the corporate law of the state of washington where the company is incorporated provides that approval of a merger or similar significant corporate transaction requires the affirmative vote of twothirds of a companys outstanding shares the beneficial ownership of these shareholders may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us delay or otherwise prevent a significant corporate transaction because the consummation of any such transaction would likely require the approval of these shareholders as a result the market price of our common stock could be affectedinvestment and partnerships in new

competitive market forces and changes in customer behavior we compete with other national regional local and online retailers that may carry similar lines of merchandise including department stores specialty stores offprice stores boutiques and internet businesses the retail environment is rapidly evolving with customer shopping preferences continuing to shift online and we expect competition in

disruptions port disruptions severe weather patterns natural disasters widespread pandemics and other natural or manmade disruptions we derive a significant amount of our total sales from stores located on the west and east coasts of the united states particularly in california which increases our exposure to conditions in these regions similarly merchandise received through west coast ports could be adversely impacted by labor disruptions these disruptions could cause among other things a decrease in consumer spending that would negatively impact our sales staffing shortages in our

regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business and financial conditionwe continue to face uncertainties due to financial services industry regulation and supervision that could have an adverse affect on our operations federal and state regulation and supervision of the financial industry has increased in recent years due to implementation of consumer protection and financial reform legislation such as the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 card act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 financial reform act the financial reform act significantly restructured regulatory oversight and other aspects of the financial industry created the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb to supervise and enforce consumer lending laws and regulations and expanded state authority over consumer lending the card act included new and revised rules and restrictions on credit card pricing finance charges and fees customer billing practices and payment application we anticipate more regulation and interpretations of the new rules to continue and depending on the nature and extent of these new regulations and interpretations we may be required to make changes to our credit card practices and systems which could adversely impact the revenues and profitability of our credit segment in addition we operate in a regulated environment where financial supervisory agencies provide oversight over our activities compliance with applicable laws and regulations could limit or restrict our activities and the conduct of our business and enforcement actions by those agencies for failure to comply

following discussion highlights the estimates we believe are critical and should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and

reviewed our disclosures that followallowance for credit lossesthe allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of the losses inherent in our credit card receivables as of the balance sheet date including uncollectible finance charges and fees we estimate such credit losses based on several factors including historical aging and delinquency trends writeoff experience portfolio concentration and risk metrics and general economic conditionswe believe the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card receivables under current conditions however significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above could materially change these expectations during 2014 our net writeoff results continued to improve as a result we reduced our allowance for credit losses by 5 during 2014 from 80 to 75 and by 5 in 2013 from 85 to 80 a 10 change in our allowance for credit losses would have affected net earnings by approximately 5 for the

taxes revenue from sales to customers shipped directly from our stores website and catalog which includes shipping revenue when applicable is recognized upon estimated receipt by the customer we estimate customer merchandise returns based on historical return patterns and reduce sales and cost of sales accordinglyalthough we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of sales returns there is a possibility that actual returns could differ from recorded amounts in the past three years there were no significant changes in customer behavior and we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of our sales return reserve a 10 change in the sales return reserve would have had a 10 impact on our net earnings for the year ended january 31 2015inventoryour merchandise inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market value using the retail inventory method under the retail method the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory the value of our inventory on the balance sheet is then reduced by a charge to cost of sales for retail inventory markdowns taken on the selling floor to determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down we consider current and anticipated demand customer preferences age of the merchandise and fashion trends inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management judgments that may affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross marginwe reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification our obsolescence reserve contains uncertainties as the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors including market conditions the selling environment historical results and current inventory trendswe do not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience in the past three years we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations

of future cash flows income approach comparable public companies and acquisitions market approach or a combination of both if fair value is lower than the carrying value then a second step is performed to quantify the amount of the impairment as part of our impairment testing we utilize certain assumptions and apply judgment regarding a number of factors significant estimates in the market
