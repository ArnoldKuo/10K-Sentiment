repurchases while these share repurchases may be offset in part by share issuances under our equity incentive plans and as consideration for acquisitions the repurchases may nevertheless have the effect of increasing the overall percentage ownership held by these shareholders the corporate law of the state of washington where the company is incorporated provides that approval of a merger or similar significant corporate transaction requires the affirmative vote of twothirds of a companys outstanding shares the beneficial ownership of these shareholders may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us delay or otherwise prevent a significant corporate transaction because the consummation of any such transaction would likely require the approval of these shareholders as a result

business litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business and financial conditionwe continue to face uncertainties due to financial services industry regulation and supervision that could have an adverse affect on our operations federal and state regulation and supervision of the financial industry has increased in recent years due to implementation of consumer protection and financial reform legislation such as the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 card act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 financial reform act the financial reform act significantly restructured regulatory oversight and other aspects of the financial industry created the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb to supervise and enforce consumer lending laws and regulations and expanded state authority over consumer lending the card act included new and revised rules and restrictions on credit card pricing finance charges and fees customer billing practices and payment application we anticipate more regulation and interpretations of the new rules to continue and depending on the nature and extent of these new regulations and interpretations we may be required to make changes to our credit card practices and systems which could adversely impact the revenues and profitability of our credit segment

revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates the following discussion highlights the estimates we believe are critical and should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial

of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures that followallowance for credit lossesthe allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of the losses inherent in our credit card receivables as of the balance sheet date including uncollectible finance charges and fees we estimate such credit losses based on several factors including historical aging and delinquency trends writeoff experience portfolio concentration and risk metrics and general economic conditionswe believe the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card receivables under current conditions however significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above could materially change these expectations during 2014 our net writeoff results continued to improve as a result we reduced our allowance for credit losses by 5 during 2014 from 80 to 75 and by 5 in 2013 from 85 to 80 a 10 change in our allowance for credit losses would have affected net earnings by approximately 5 for the fiscal year ended january 31 201532table of contentsrevenue recognitionwe recognize revenue from sales at our retail stores at the point of sale net of estimated sales returns and excluding sales taxes revenue from sales to customers shipped directly from our stores website and catalog which includes shipping revenue when applicable is recognized upon estimated receipt by the customer we estimate customer merchandise returns based on historical return patterns and reduce sales and cost of sales accordinglyalthough we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of sales returns there is a possibility that actual returns could differ from recorded amounts in the past three years there were no significant changes in customer behavior and we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of our sales return reserve a 10 change in the sales return reserve would have had a 10 impact on our net earnings for the year ended january 31 2015inventoryour merchandise inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market value using the retail inventory method under the retail method the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory the value of our inventory on the balance sheet is then reduced by a charge to cost of sales for retail inventory markdowns taken on the selling floor to determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down we consider current and anticipated demand customer preferences age of the merchandise and fashion trends inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management judgments that may affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross marginwe reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification our obsolescence reserve contains uncertainties as the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors including market conditions the selling environment historical results and current inventory trendswe do not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience in the past three years we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of the obsolescence reserve a 10 change in the obsolescence reserve would have had no material impact on our net earnings for the year ended january 31 2015goodwillwe review our goodwill annually for impairment or when circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level comprised of the principal business units within our retail segment through the application of a twostep fair value test the first step compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value which is based on the expected present value of future cash flows income approach comparable public companies and acquisitions market approach or a combination of both if fair value is lower than the carrying value then a second step is performed to quantify the amount of the impairment as part of our impairment testing we utilize certain assumptions and apply judgment regarding a number of factors significant estimates in the market approach include identifying similar companies and acquisitions with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return of investment and assessing comparable earnings or revenue multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit assumptions in the income approach include future cash flows for the business future growth rates and discount rates estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to the business model or changes in operating performance for nordstromcom jeffrey and hautelook the fair values substantially exceeded carrying values and therefore we had no goodwill impairment in 2014 2013 or 2012 the fair value of trunk clubs reporting unit

interest rates from our reporting date we utilized two sensitivity scenarios i linear growth of approximately 225 basis points over the year and ii linear decline of approximately 15 basis points over the year due to the fact that current interest rates are near historically low levels other key parameters and assumptions in our sensitivity analyses include the average cash and cash equivalents

hypothetical scenario would not have a material effect on future earningsfor our longterm fixedrate debt of 3131 our exposure to interest rate risk is limited to changes in the fair value of our debt

of the losses inherent in our credit card receivables as of the balance sheet date including uncollectible finance charges and fees we estimate such credit losses based on several factors including historical aging and delinquency trends writeoff experience portfolio concentration and risk metrics and general economic conditions for purposes of determining impairment and recording the associated allowance for credit losses we evaluate our credit card receivables on a collective basis as they are composed of large groups of smallerbalance homogeneous loans and therefore are not individually evaluated for impairment we record estimated uncollectible principal balances to bad debt expense while estimated uncollectible finance charges and fees result in a reduction of credit card revenue credit card receivables constitute unsecured consumer loans for which the risk of cardholder default and associated credit losses tend to increase as general economic conditions deterioratewe consider a credit card account delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the payment due date our aging method is based on the number of completed billing cycles during which the customer has failed to make a minimum payment delinquent accounts including accrued finance charges and fees are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible during the third quarter of 2014 we modified our writeoff policy from 150 days past due to 180 days past due to better align with industry practice accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikelyconcurrent with our writeoff policy change discussed above we now recognize finance charges and fees on delinquent accounts until they become 150 days past due after which we place accounts on nonaccrual status payments received for accounts on nonaccrual status are applied to accrued finance charges fees and principal balances consistent with other accounts with

121 and nordstromcom and jeffrey goodwill of 53 we review our goodwill annually for impairment or when circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level comprised of the principal business units within our retail segment through the application of a twostep fair value test the first step compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value which is based on the expected present value of future cash flows income approach comparable public companies and acquisitions market approach or a combination of both if fair value is lower than the carrying value then a second step is performed to quantify the amount of the impairment the fair value of trunk clubs reporting unit will be tested in 2015when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of longlived assets including buildings equipment and amortizable intangible assets may be impaired we perform an evaluation of recoverability by comparing the carrying values of the net assets to their related projected undiscounted future cash flows in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses upon indication that the carrying values of longlived assets will not be recoverable we recognize an impairment loss we estimate the fair value of the assets using the expected present value of future cash flows of

statementsdollar and share amounts in millions except per share per option and per unit amountsas part of the acquisition we created a value creation plan vcp to incentivize trunk club employees to increase the value of the trunk club business the vcp has three payout scenarios that are determined based on the trunk club business meeting minimum or exceeding maximum fiscal 2018 sales and earnings metrics if the minimum is not met the payout is 0 outcome a if the maximum is met the payout is 100 outcome b if the sales and earnings metrics surpass the minimum but do not reach the maximum the payout is based on the incremental value growth of the trunk club business since acquisition and will be between 0 and 100 outcome c we estimate the grant date fair value for each outcome and recognize expense based upon outcome c deemed most probable if at any time it becomes probable that another outcome will be achieved compensation expense will be cumulatively adjusted based on the grant date fair value associated with that outcome the final payout amount will be determined at the end of fiscal 2018 and settled in fiscal 2019 at our discretion in either cash or stock we intend to settle the vcp in stockas of the fiscal year ended january 31 2015 based on the payout scenario we believe is probable we estimated the grant date fair value of 10 per unit using the blackscholes valuation model stockbased compensation expense will be recognized on an accelerated basis due to the performance criteria and graded vesting features of the vcp in 2014 we recognized 3 in stockbased compensation expense associated with the vcp as of january 31 2015 we have granted 08 of the 10 units available for grant total unrecognized stockbased compensation expense related to nonvested vcp units was 6 which we expect to recognize over the next 43 monthsperformance share unitswe generally grant performance share units to executive officers as one of the ways to align compensation with shareholder interests performance share units are earned after a threeyear performance cycle only when our total shareholder return reflecting daily stock price appreciation and compounded reinvestment of dividends outperforms companies in a defined group of competitors determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors performance share units granted in 2012 and 2013 also require the total shareholder return to be positive for any payout the percentage of units that are earned depends on our relative position at the end of the performance cycle and can range from 0 to 175 of the number of units grantedbecause performance share units are payable in either cash or stock as elected by the employee they are classified as a liability award the liability is remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to earnings at each fiscal quarterend during the performance cycle the performance share unit liability is remeasured using the estimated percentage of units earned multiplied by the closing market price of our common stock on the current periodend date and is prorated based on the amount of time that has passed in the vesting period the price used to determine the amount of cash received for the performance share units upon vesting is the closing market price of our common stock on the last day of the performance cyclethe following is a summary of
