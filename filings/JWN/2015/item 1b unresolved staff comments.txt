an increase in our tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations we are also regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business and financial conditionwe continue to face uncertainties due to financial services industry regulation and supervision that could have an adverse affect on our operations federal and state regulation and supervision of the financial industry has increased in recent years due to implementation of consumer protection and financial reform legislation such as the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 card act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 financial reform act the financial reform act significantly restructured regulatory oversight and other aspects of the financial industry created the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb to supervise and enforce consumer lending laws and regulations and expanded state authority over consumer lending the card act included new and revised rules and restrictions on credit card pricing finance charges and fees customer billing practices and payment application we anticipate more regulation and interpretations of the new rules to continue and depending on the nature and extent of these new regulations and interpretations we may be required to make changes to our credit card practices and systems which could adversely impact the revenues and profitability of our credit segment in addition we operate in a regulated environment where financial supervisory agencies provide oversight over our activities compliance with applicable laws and regulations could limit or restrict our activities and the conduct of our business and enforcement actions by those agencies for failure to comply could have an adverse impact on usnordstrom inc and subsidiaries  9table of contentsitem 1b
