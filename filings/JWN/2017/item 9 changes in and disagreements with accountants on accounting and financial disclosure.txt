the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the related net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization we review our goodwill annually for impairment or when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level comprised of the principal business units within our retail segment through the application of

transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations and are recorded as gains or losses in the consolidated statements of earnings as of january 28 2017 activities associated with the foreign currency exchange risk have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statementsrecent accounting pronouncementsin may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which was subsequently modified in august 2015 by asu no 201514 revenue from contracts with customers deferral of the effective date the core principle of asu no 201409 is that companies should recognize revenue when the transfer of promised goods or services to customers occurs in an amount that reflects what the company expects to receive it requires additional disclosures to describe the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers in 2016 the fasb issued additional asus that clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations on identifying performance obligations and licensing on the revenue recognition criteria and other technical corrections in our ongoing evaluation of the impacts of this asu we have determined that the new standard will have the following effects on the timing and amount of revenue recognized gift card breakage income will be recognized at the point of sale rather than when redemption is considered remote sales attributable to the loyalty program benefits eg points alterations will be deferred rather than recorded as an increase to cost of sales revenue related to our online sales will be recognized at the shipping point rather than receipt by the customer and estimated costs of returns will be recorded as a current asset rather than netted with our sales return reserve we plan to adopt this asu in the first quarter of 2018 and are continuing to evaluate the impacts this asu and related disclosures will have on our consolidated financial statements as well as our preferred transition method in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases this asu increases transparency and comparability by recognizing a lessees rights and obligations resulting from leases by recording them on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities the new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee this classification dictates whether lease expense is to be recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straightline basis over the term of the lease this asu is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019 though we are currently evaluating the impact of these provisions we expect they will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statementsin march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting this asu impacts several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows this asu is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2017 we have evaluated this asu and believe the impact to our consolidated financial statements upon adoption will be immaterial however actual results will be dependent on unpredictable events including the future price of our common stock option exercise activity and forfeitures46table of contentsnordstrom incnotes to consolidated financial statementsdollar and share amounts in millions

payment rate credit loss rate and revenues and expenses associated with the program agreement given our review of market participant capital structures in the banking and credit card industries and

primarily goodwill investment in contract asset and longlived tangible and intangible assets in connection with periodic evaluations for potential impairment we estimate the fair value of these assets using primarily unobservable inputs and as such these are considered level 3 fair value measurementsin 2014 we acquired 100 of the outstanding equity of trunk club for a net purchase price of 280 which was settled in nordstrom common stock and the following year we settled 23 of an indemnity holdback through nordstrom common stock in connection with the acquisition we recorded 261 of goodwill in the third quarter of 2016 the longterm operating plan for trunk club was updated to reflect current expectations for future growth and profitability which were lower than previous expectations due to lowered expectations we tested trunk club goodwill for impairment one quarter prior to the annual evaluation step 1 test results indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value52table of contentsnordstrom incnotes to consolidated financial statementsdollar and share amounts in millions except per share per option and per unit amountsin our step 2 analysis we used a combination of the expected present value of future cash flows income approach and comparable public companies market approach to determine the fair value of the reporting unit these approaches use primarily unobservable inputs including discount sales growth and profit margin rates which are considered level 3 fair value measurements the fair value analysis took into account recent and expected operating performance as well as the overall decline in the retail industry within our retail segment we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 197 reducing trunk club goodwill to 64 from 261 as of january 30 2016 in 2015 we recorded asset impairment charges of 59 which are included in our retail business selling general and administrative expenses we did not record
