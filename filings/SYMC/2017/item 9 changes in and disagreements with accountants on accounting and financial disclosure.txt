technologies product lines or companies we may acquire or dispose of other technologies products and companies in the future see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our acquisitions in fiscal 2017competitionour markets are consolidating highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the competitive landscape has changed significantly over the past few years with new competition arising much of the market growth has come from startups whose focus is on solving a specific customer issue or delivering a nicheoriented product and from larger integration providers that increasingly are looking to put various types of protection into their platforms we are focused on delivering 6table of contentscomprehensive customer solutions

necessary to be successful in our industry include product quality and effectiveness timetomarket price reputation financial stability breadth of product offerings customer support brand recognition and effective sales and marketing effortsin addition to the competition we face from direct competitors we face indirect or potential competition from retailers application providers operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products we also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for spending at the retail level and in corporate accounts in addition we compete with other software companies operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems to acquire technologies products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties we also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers and enterprises by oemsmost of the channels in which our products are offered are highly competitive some of our consumer competitors are intensely focused on customer acquisition which has led competitors to offer their technology for free engage in aggressive marketing or enter into competitive partnerships we view our competitive landscape as followsour primary security competitors are mcafee formerly intel security microsoft corporation microsoft and trend micro inc there are also several freeware providers and regional security companies that we compete againstfor

independent security vendors such as palo alto networks inc fireeye inc niksun and trend micro inc further as new it budgets are created to support nextgeneration threat protection we expect to compete with more highly specialized vendors as well as larger vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their productsour principal competitors in the wan optimization market are riverbed

occursintellectual propertyprotective measureswe regard some of the features of our internal operations software and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures contractual arrangements and other measures to protect our proprietary information our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products services and technology and enhance our competitive positionas part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees distributors and corporate partners and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information these license agreements are generally nontransferable and have either a perpetual or subscription based time limited term we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities equipment and

have used registered or applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions we enforce our trademark service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use7table of contentswe have approximately 2100 patents in addition to foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications which relate to various aspects of our products and technology the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically 17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our productsour products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad however these measures may not provide sufficient protection and our intellectual property rights may be challenged in addition we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark license or other intellectual property rightseasonalityas is typical for many large technology companies our business is seasonal orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met and because a significant portion of our inperiod revenue comes from our deferred revenue balanceemployeesas of march 31 2017 we employed more than 13000 people worldwideavailable informationour internet home page is located at

is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stockif we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limitedfor the last few years we have experienced a number of transitions as we have attempted to revitalize our business model improve execution and innovate new products and services these transitions have involved changes to management and other key personnel shifts in our strategic direction and more recently changes to our corporate structure as a result of the divestiture of veritas and the acquisition of blue coat in particular in connection with our acquisition of blue coat we experienced changes to our executive team during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2017 appointing three former blue coat executive officers to the positions of chief executive officer president and chief operating officer and executive vice president and chief financial officer transitions of these kind can be disruptive can result in the loss of institutional focus and employee morale and make the execution of business strategies more difficult we are also focused on addressing dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the continued decline in the pc market the market shifts towards mobility the continued transition towards cloudbased solutions and architectural shifts in the provision of security all of which has made it more difficult for us to compete effectively and requires us to improve our product and service offerings we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with these efforts and the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our businessfluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial resultswe are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors including market transitions general economic conditions competition product obsolescence technological change shifts in buying patterns financial difficulties and budget constraints of our current and potential customers awareness of security threats to it systems and other factors while such factors may in some periods increase product sales fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales if demand for our products and solutions declines whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in buying patterns our revenues and margins would likely be adversely affectedadditionally since blue coats business historically experienced a major product refresh cycle approximately once every five 8table of contentsyears as hardware appliances reach the end of their useful life we anticipate that we will experience fluctuations in demand as we enter and exit cycles in which many of our customers refresh their install base of hardware appliance products with our latest equipment replacing older versions of the hardware that have reached the end of their useful life and are no longer supported under maintenance contracts our appliances generally have a five year endoflife date from the date of purchase which we expect will extend refresh cycles for our hardware appliances over a multiyear period and reduce the impact of a product refresh cycle in any one period however we cannot assure you that we will not experience uneven demand for these products in any one period causing our business and results of operations to be adversely affecteda refresh cycle also creates an opportunity for our competitors to try to displace our existing product deployments for our customers who may be more inclined to consider other product solutions at a time when they otherwise need to replace our existing products that have reached the end of their useful life the extent to which customers decide to refresh by purchasing products from our current or future competitors as opposed to purchasing our new products may significantly impact our current period product revenues as well as future service revenueour business depends on customers renewing their arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offeringsa large portion of our revenue is derived from arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings yet existing customers have no contractual obligation to purchase additional solutions after the initial subscription or contract period our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our solutions or our customer support customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions compared with the solutions offered by our competitors any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected if at all accordingly we must invest significant time and resources in providing ongoing value to our customers if these efforts fail or if our customers do not renew for other reasons or if they renew on terms less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business will sufferif we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance or if we are unable to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends our business and operating results could be adversely affectedour future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products product upgrades and services on a timely basis we have in the past incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive additionally we must continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space the continued decline in the pc market and the market shift towards mobility and the increasing transition towards cloudbased solutions all of which have made it more difficult for us to compete effectively for example we have been increasingly investing in solutions that address the cloud security market particularly our acquisition of blue coat but we cannot be certain that the cloud security market will develop at a rate or in the manner we expect or that we will be able to compete successfully with more established competitors in the cloud security market customers may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have our failure to develop solutions that satisfy customer preferences in a timely and costeffective manner may harm our ability to renew our subscriptions with existing customers and to create or increase demand for our solutions and may adversely impact our operating results new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges includingmanaging the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements which has frequently been longer than we originally expectedadapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customersextending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms operating systems and hardware products such as mobile devicesentering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited experiencemanaging new product and service strategies for the markets in which we operateaddressing trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship our productsdeveloping or expanding efficient sales channels andobtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products including source code licenses for certain products with deep technical integration into operating systemsif we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges or if our new products product upgrades and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance our business and operating results could be adversely affectedwe operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to declinewe operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry 9table of contentsstandards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business and operating results to compete successfully we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors appropriately respond to competitive strategies and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed used and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands our competitive position and our financial results could be adversely affectedour competitors include software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to endusers of our products we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors products than our products in addition software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform in the future further product development by these vendors could cause our software applications and services to become redundant which could significantly impact our sales and financial resultswe face growing competition from network equipment computer hardware manufacturers large operating system providers and other technology companies as well as from companies in the identity threat protection space such as credit bureaus many of these competitors are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection software that competes at some levels with our product offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our productssecurity protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or in some cases is offered free of charge some companies offer the lowerpriced or free security products within their computer hardware or software products that we believe are inferior to our products and saas offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these security products as replacing the need for more effective full featured products and services such as those that we provide the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results by causing among other things price reductions of our products reduced profitability and loss of market sharemany of our competitors have greater financial technical sales marketing or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we competereduced trust in our ssltls certificates could adversely affect our website security businessour website security business depends on the widespread acceptance of the digital certificates we provide to enable communications security infrastructure we have in the past issued and may in the future issue ssltls certificates out of compliance with the requirements of the certificate authority and browser forum baseline requirements failures of this kind could cause popular browsers to reduce or eliminate trust in our ssltsl certificates or the related roots or otherwise disrupt our position as a leading certificate authority for example google recently issued a proposal to reduce trust in our ssltsl certificates based on our past issuance of noncompliant certificates if any popular browser reduced trust in our ssltsl certificates or roots it would damage our brand and cause our ssltsl certificates to fail to interoperate resulting in customer attrition for our website security business which could adversely affect our results of operations and our stock pricefluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the trading price of our outstanding securities in the past and could affect the trading price of outstanding securities in the futureour quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors the trading price of our outstanding securities could be negatively affected any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performancefactors associated with our industry the operation of

our outstanding securities to fluctuate significantlyour business models present execution and competitive risksin recent years our saas offerings have become increasingly critical in our business our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying saas offerings for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud we are making significant investments in and devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own saas strategies including our acquisition of blue coat in august 2016 we cannot assure you that our investments in and development of saas offerings will achieve the expected returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the marketplace in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support saas offerings these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this business model depends on our execution in a number of areas includingcontinuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloudbased experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share andensuring that our saas offerings meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their datawe may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully the intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact pricing in both our onpremise enterprise software business and our cloud business as well as overall demand for our onpremise software product and service offerings which could reduce our revenues and profitability our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings which could put pressure on us to further discount our product or support pricingany broadbased change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies we or our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm gotomarket or pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products if we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer 11table of

use our saas offerings for missioncritical protection from threats to electronic information endpoint devices and computer networks any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our saas offerings could significantly harm our reputation and may damage our customers businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigationwe currently serve our saasbased customers from hosting facilities located across the globe damage to or failure of any significant element of these hosting facilities could result in interruptions in our service which could harm our customers and expose us to liability interruptions or failures in our service delivery could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us could adversely affect our renewal rates and could harm our ability to attract new customers our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that our saas offerings are unreliablewe collect use disclose store or otherwise process personal information which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our businesswe collect use store or disclose collectively process an increasingly large amount of personal information including from employees and customers in connection with the operation of our business the volume variety and velocity of the personal information we process increased significantly as a result of our acquisition of lifelock in february 2017 as its identity and fraud protection offerings rely on large data repositories of personal information and consumer transactions the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security as well as contractual commitments any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions fines litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business our customers may also accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a device that is lost or stolen creating the perception that our systems are not secure against thirdparty accessadditionally if third parties that we work with such as vendors or developers violate applicable laws or our policies such violations may also place personal information at risk and have an adverse effect on our business changes to applicable privacy or data security laws could impact how we process personal information and therefore limit the effectiveness of our products services or features or our ability to develop new products services or featuresour acquisitions and divestitures create special risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial resultsas part of our business strategy we may acquire or divest businesses or assets these activities can involve a number of special risks and challenges includingcomplexity time and costs associated with managing these transactions including the integration of acquired business operations workforce products and technologiesdiversion of management time and attentionloss or termination of employees including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employeesassumption of liabilities of the acquired business or assets including litigation related to the acquired business or assetsthe addition of acquisitionrelated debt as well as increased expenses and working capital requirementsdilution of stock ownership of existing stockholdersincreased or unexpected costs unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations andsubstantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses writeoff of inprocess research and development impairment of goodwill amortization of intangible assets and stockbased compensation expenseif integration of our acquired businesses is not successful we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects to integrate acquired businesses we must integrate and manage the personnel and technology systems of the acquired operations we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions moreover to be successful some acquisitions particularly acquisitions of large complex companies such as blue coat and lifelock depend on largescale product technology and sales force integrations that are difficult to complete on a timely basis or at all and may be more susceptible to the special risks and 12table of contentschallenges described aboveany of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability or other financial benefits from our divested or acquired businesses or assets or to realize other anticipated benefits of divestitures or acquisitions such as anticipated operating efficiencies or other cost savingsif we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers our operating results could be adversely affected we sell our products to customers around the world through multitiered sales and distribution networkssales through these different channels involve distinct risks including the followingdirect sales a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to endusers special risks associated with direct sales includelonger sales cycles associated with direct sales effortsdifficulty in hiring retaining and motivating our direct sales force particularly through periods of transition in our organization andsubstantial amounts of training for sales representatives to become productive in selling our products and services including regular updates to cover new and revised products and associated delays and difficulties in recognizing the expected benefits of investments in new products and updatesindirect sales channels a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels including distributors that sell our products to endusers and other resellers this channel involves a number of risks includingour lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to endusersour resellers and distributors are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customersour reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without causeour resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing products and may from time to time place greater emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing promotions and other terms offered by our competitors andthe consolidation of electronics retailers has increased their negotiating power with respect to hardware and software providers such as usoem sales channels a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into or bundle our products with their products our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks includingour lack of control over the volume of systems shipped and the timing of such shipmentsour oem partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customersour oem partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due to competitive conditions in our markets and other factorssales through our oem partners are subject to changes in general economic conditions strategic direction competitive risks and other issues that could result in a reduction of oem salesthe development work that we must generally undertake under our agreements with our oem partners may require us to invest significant resources and incur significant costs with little or no assurance of ever receiving associated revenuesthe time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our oem partners to become familiar with our products may make it more difficult to introduce those products to the market andour oem partners may develop market and distribute their own products and market and distribute products of our competitors which could reduce our salesif we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results in addition reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future and could result in adverse operating results in future periodsover the long term we intend to invest in research and development activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating resultswhile we continue to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest significantly in 13table of contentsresearch and development activities as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation in each of our business segments we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position and that the level of these investments will increase in future periods as the blue coat acquisition has expanded our focus areas we recognize the costs associated with these research and development investments earlier than the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affectedchanges in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairmentsin response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel reschedule or adjust with contract manufacturers and suppliersfurther our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earningsour inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our businesswe are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers for example we host many of our products using thirdparty data center facilities and we do not control the operation of these facilities these facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they are also subject to breakins computer viruses sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our products and servicesfurthermore our business administration human resources and finance services depend on the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations a disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster or other business continuity event could cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers in addition we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis which could adversely affect the trading value of our stock although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backedup there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient manner including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat networkany errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our products and services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers businesses for example we may experience disruptions outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors including infrastructure changes human or software errors capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our website simultaneously fraud or security attacks in some instances we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time interruptions in our products and services including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us in addition our business would be harmed if any of events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our services are unreliable our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose customer data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenariowe may experience difficulties in realizing the expected benefits of the acquisition of blue coat and lifelock and may continue to incur significant acquisitionrelated costs and transition costs in connection with these acquisitions we completed the acquisition of blue coat in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and lifelock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we have invested and continue to invest substantial monetary and other resources in the integration of these companies the success of each acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities including certain cost savings and operational efficiencies or synergies and growth prospects from combining the respective companies with symantec in an efficient and effective manner we may never realize these business opportunities and growth prospects we may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees management cannot ensure that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term or at alladditionally we may encounter difficulties surrounding the integration of these companies which could delay or prevent our achievement of the expected benefits from the respective acquisition moreover risks specific to the acquired businesses could 14table of contentsalso delay or prevent our achievement of the expected benefits from the respective acquisition for example since lifelocks identity and fraud protection products depend extensively upon continued access to and receipt of credible timely and complete data from external sources including data received from customers vendors who are also competitors and fulfillment partners the value we derive from the lifelock acquisition our competitive position and our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed as a result of our loss of access to data sources or reliance on sources that prove to be ineffective or inaccurateas a result of our acquisition of lifelock our consumer digital safety segment became subject to increased regulation which could impede our ability to market and provide our services or adversely affect our business financial position and results of operationsas a result of our acquisition of lifelock a portion of our consumer digital safety segment became subject to increased regulation including a wide variety of federal state and local laws and regulations including the fair credit reporting act the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission act ftc act and comparable state laws that are patterned after the ftc act moreover lifelock entered into consent decrees and similar arrangements with the federal trade commission the ftc and 35 states attorneys general in 2010 and a settlement with the ftc in 2015 relating to allegations that certain of lifelocks advertising and marketing practices constituted deceptive acts or practices in violation of the ftc act which impose additional restrictions on the lifelock business within our consumer digital safety segment including prohibitions against making any misrepresentation of the means methods procedures effects effectiveness coverage or scope of lifelocks identity theft protection services any of the laws and regulations that apply to our business are subject to revision or new or changed interpretations and we cannot predict the impact of such changes on our businessadditionally as a result of our lifelock acquisition aspects of our consumer digital safety segment are subject to the broad regulatory supervisory and enforcement powers of the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb and may exercise authority with respect to our services or the marketing and servicing of those services by overseeing our financial institution or credit reporting agency customers and suppliers or by otherwise exercising its supervisory regulatory or enforcement authority over consumer financial products and servicesany cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect and these actions may adversely affect our businessin may 2016 we announced a fiscal 2017 restructuring plan to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2018 this initiative could result in disruptions to our operations any costcutting measures could also negatively impact our business by delaying the introduction of new products or technologies interrupting service of additional products or impacting employee retention in addition we cannot be sure that the cost reduction and streamlining initiatives will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or streamlining if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses our results of operations will sufferour international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our managementwe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us including engineering sales customer support and production we have expanded through our acquisition of blue coat and expect further expansion of our international operations but such expansion is contingent upon our identification of growth opportunities our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations includingpotential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws or that may not be adequately enforcedrequirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operationsregulations or restrictions on the use import or export of encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communicationslocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulationscentral bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the usfluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and inflationary conditions could reduce our customers ability to obtain financing for software products or could make our products more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countrieslimitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operationslonger payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivabledifficulties in staffing managing and operating our international operations including difficulties related to administering our stock plans in some foreign countries15table of contentsdifficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operationsseasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in europe and in other periods in other countriescosts and delays associated with developing software and providing support in multiple languages andpolitical unrest war or terrorism or regional natural disasters particularly in areas in which we have facilitiesa significant portion of our transactions outside of the us is denominated in foreign currencies accordingly our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates for example in recent periods the us dollar has strengthened significantly against the euro and other major currencies which has adversely impacted our reported international revenue we expect to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the us continue to increasethe level of corporate income tax from sales to our nonus customers is generally less than the level of tax from sales to our us customers this benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefitsour products are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments systems applications and configurations which could result in errors or product failuresbecause we offer very complex products undetected errors failures or bugs may occur especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released our products are often installed and used in largescale computing environments with different operating systems system management software and equipment and networking configurations which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors failures or bugs in our products our customers computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and nonstandard configurations that make prerelease testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and timeconsuming in addition despite testing by us and others errors failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments in the past we have discovered software errors failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and in some cases have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errorserrors failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity damage to our brand product returns loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products loss of competitive position or claims by customers or others many of our enduser customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other less critical software products in addition if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity security or availability occurs in one of our enduser customers systems regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating resultsif we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements and manage our supply chain we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays that could harm our businesswe generally provide forecasts of our requirements to our supply chain partners on a rolling basis if our forecast exceeds our actual requirements a supply chain partner may assess additional charges or we may have liability for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margin if our forecast is less than our actual requirements the applicable supply chain partner may have insufficient time or components to produce or fulfill our product requirements which could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products or fulfillment of orders for our products and result in delays in shipments customer dissatisfaction and deferral or loss of revenue further we may be required to purchase sufficient inventory to satisfy our future needs in situations where a component or product is being discontinued if we fail to accurately predict our requirements we may be unable to fulfill those orders or we may be required to record charges for excess inventory any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operationswe are dependent on original design manufacturers contract manufacturers and thirdparty logistics providers to design and manufacture our hardwarebased products and to fulfill orders for our hardwarebased productswe depend primarily on original design manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty original design manufacturer for numerous companies to codesign and codevelop the hardware platforms for our products we also depend on independent contract manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty contract manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture and fulfill our hardwarebased products these supply chain partners are not committed to design or manufacture our products or to fulfill orders for our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition certain of our products or key components of our products are currently manufactured by a single thirdparty supplier there are alternative suppliers that could provide components as our agreements do not provide for exclusivity or minimum purchase quantities but the transition and qualification from one supplier to another could be lengthy costly and difficult also from time to time we may be required to add new supply chain partner relationships or new manufacturing or fulfillment sites to accommodate growth in orders or the addition of new products it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement new supply chain partner relationships and new manufacturing or fulfillment sites and such additions increase the complexity of our supply chain management our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to effectively manage our supply chain partner relationships if one or more of our original design manufacturers does not meet our development schedules if one or more of our independent contract manufacturers 16table of contentsexperiences delays disruptions or quality control problems in manufacturing our products if one or more of our thirdparty logistics providers experiences delays or disruptions or otherwise fails to meet our fulfillment schedules or if we are required to add or replace original design manufacturers independent contract manufacturers thirdparty logistics providers or fulfillment sitesin addition these supply chain partners have access to certain of our critical confidential information and could wrongly disclose or misuse such information or be subject to a breach or other compromise that introduces a vulnerability or other defect in the products manufactured by our supply chain partners while we take precautions to ensure that hardware manufactured by our independent contractors is reviewed any espionage acts malware attacks theft of confidential information or other malicious cyber incidents perpetrated either directly or indirectly through our independent contractors may compromise our system infrastructure expose us to litigation and associated expenses and lead to reputational harm that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results in addition we are subject to risks resulting from the perception that certain jurisdictions including china do not comply with internationally recognized rights of freedom of expression and privacy and may permit labor practices that are deemed unacceptable under evolving standards of social responsibility if manufacturing or logistics in these foreign countries is disrupted for any reason including natural disasters it system failures military or government actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or if the purchase or sale of products from such foreign countries is prohibited or disfavored our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affectedthe doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries and procedures pertaining to a manufacturers efforts regarding the source of such minerals sec rules implementing these requirements and other international standards such as the organisation for economic cooperation and development due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflictaffected and high risk areas may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply drc conflict free components and parts and we may not be able to obtain drc conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our products we may also face reputational challenges with our customers stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals used in our productsif we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology our financial results could be harmedmost of our software and underlying technology is proprietary we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws however all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain use distribute and sell our proprietary information without authorizationthird parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents our shrink wrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions furthermore the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers in addition any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us which could adversely affect our operating resultsfrom time to time we are a party to lawsuits and investigations which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and which could if not determined favorably negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe have initiated and been named as a party to lawsuits including patent litigation class actions and governmental claims and we may be named in additional litigation the expense of initiating and defending such litigation may be costly and divert managements attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows in addition an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant fines settlements monetary damages or injunctive relief that could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business results of operations and cash flowsthird parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our productsfrom time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights including claims regarding patents copyrights and trademarks because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that the number of these claims may grow in addition former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to stop selling delay shipments of or redesign our products pay monetary amounts as damages enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have 17table of contentswith some of our customers we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this riskin addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability this liability or our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating resultsadverse global economic events may impact our customers ability to do business with us thereby harming our business operating results and financial conditionadverse macroeconomic conditions could negatively affect our customers thereby impacting our business operating results or financial condition during challenging economic times and periods of high unemployment current or potential customers may delay or forgo decisions to license new products or additional instances of existing products upgrade their existing hardware or operating environments which upgrades are often a catalyst for new purchases of our software or purchase services customers may also have difficulties in obtaining the requisite thirdparty financing to complete the purchase of our products and services any of these scenarios could adversely affect our businessour exposure to credit risk and payment delinquencies on our accounts receivable significantly increases in adverse economic conditionsan adverse macroeconomic environment could subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us or delay paying us for previously purchased products and services our outstanding accounts receivables are generally not secured in addition our standard terms and conditions permit payment within a specified number of days following the receipt of our product accordingly reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase in addition weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us this would further increase our credit risk exposure and potentially cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers further while no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total net revenues in any of fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 two distributors and one distributor accounted for 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2017 and april 1 2016 respectively the loss of this or other large customers could have a negative impact on our business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our receivables and have not suffered any material losses to date there can be no assurance such procedures will continue to effectively limit our credit risk and avoid future lossesour effective tax rate may increase which could increase our income tax expense and reduce increase our net income lossour effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control includingchanges in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rateschanging tax laws regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate including possible corporate tax reform in the us actions resulting from the organisation for economic cooperation and developments base erosion and profit shifting project proposed actions by international bodies as well as the requirements of certain tax rulingsthe tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periodstax assessments or any related tax interest or penalties that could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place andtaxes arising in connection with the recent divestiture of veritaswe report our results of operations based on our determination of the aggregate amount of taxes owed in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate from time to time we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities we are engaged in disputes of this nature at this time if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affectedwe cannot predict our future capital needs and we may be unable to obtain financing which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditionthe onset or continuation of adverse economic conditions may make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations investing activities including potential acquisitions or divestitures or financing activities any required financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our financial or operational flexibility and would also require us to fund additional interest expense if additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance our software and 18table of contentsservices through acquisitions in order to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures which could have a material adverse effect on our software and services offerings revenues results of operations and financial conditionfailure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position ability to hedge certain financial risks borrowing costs and access to capital marketsour credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies and such agencies have in the past and could in the future downgrade our ratings we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position ability to hedge certain financial risks and access to capital markets in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debtour substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial conditionas of march 31 2017 we had an aggregate of 83 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar years 2017 and 2025 including approximately 46 billion in aggregate principal amount of existing senior notes and 37 billion of outstanding term loans under our senior credit facilities and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in addition as of march 31 2017 we had 10 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility our ability to pay interest and repay principal for our substantial level of indebtedness is dependent on our ability to manage our business operations generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfullyour substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences including the followingwe must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on the term loans and revolving credit facility our existing notes and other indebtedness which will reduce funds available to us for other purposes such as working capital capital expenditures other general corporate purposes and potential acquisitionsour ability to refinance such indebtedness or to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impairedwe will be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates because borrowings under our senior credit facilities bear interest at variable ratesour leverage may be greater than that of some of our competitors which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in responding to current and changing industry and financial market conditionswe may be more vulnerable to the current economic downturn and adverse developments in our businesswe may be unable to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt agreements which could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived may result in acceleration of certain of our debt and would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects and could force us into bankruptcy or liquidationin the event of the insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other winding up of our business if there are not sufficient assets remaining to pay all creditors then all or a portion of the amounts due on the notes then outstanding would remain unpaid andchanges by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities adversely affect our access to debt markets and increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future subject to the restrictions contained in the existing credit agreements and the terms of our other indebtedness our ability to access additional funding under our revolving credit facility will depend upon among other things the absence of a default under such facility including any default arising from a failure to comply with the related covenants if we are unable to comply with such covenants our liquidity may be adversely affected as of march 31 2017 approximately 37 billion of our debt bore interest at variable rates and the adverse effect of a 50basis point increase in interest rates would have increased such total annual cash interest by approximately 19 millionour ability to meet expenses to remain in compliance with our covenants under our debt instruments and to make future principal and interest payments in respect of our debt depends on among other things our operating performance competitive developments and financial market conditions all of which are significantly affected by financial business economic and other factors we are not able to control many of these factors accordingly our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt including the notes and meet our other obligationsour existing credit agreements impose operating and financial restrictions on usthe existing credit agreements contain

substantially all of our assetsall of these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations meet or otherwise address our capital needs pursue business opportunities react to market conditions or otherwise restrict activities or business plans a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness if a default occurs the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and to the extent such indebtedness is secured in the future proceed against any collateral securing that indebtednesswe may not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities to service or repay our indebtedness and meet our other cash needs and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successfulour ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our ability to generate cash will be subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors some of which are beyond our control in particular we have 6810 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that is maturing within the next five fiscal years 1310 million of which is now being classified as current if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt our future cash flow cash on hand or available borrowings may not be sufficient to meet our obligations and commitments if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service or repay our indebtedness and to meet our other commitments we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital these actions may not be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all or these actions may not enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements in addition the existing credit agreements contain and any of our other debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all our debtsin addition we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries none of which are generally guarantors of our debt accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will be dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise in general our subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our debt or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make the required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and as a result certain of our creditors could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation our software products saas offerings and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future salesdespite our precautions and significant

required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary 20table of contentssoftware with open source software in a certain manner in addition to risks related to

origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our businessif we are unable to adequately address increased customer demands through our technical support services our relationships with our customers and our financial results may be adversely affectedwe offer technical support services with many of our products we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers further customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating resultswe have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers if these companies experience financial difficulties do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted which could materially harm our relationships with these customersif we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees lose key personnel fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully or fail to manage our employee base effectively we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products and services effectively manage or expand our business or increase our revenuesour future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management technical sales marketing finance and other personnel our officers and other key personnel are employeesatwill and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant and we face difficulties in attracting retaining and motivating employees as a result in connection with the acquisition of blue coat we experienced management turnover and this may lead to employee attrition and related difficulties and these difficulties may continue or increase following our acquisition of lifelock in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of equitybased compensation as compensation expense as a result we may decide to issue fewer equitybased incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees or conversely if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions our business and operating results could be adversely affectedeffective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution from time to time key personnel leave our company and the incidence of this increased in recent periods due to the transitions we have experienced over the last few years including the divestiture of veritas for example in connection with the blue coat acquisition we appointed their chief executive officer president and chief operating officer and chief financial officer to those positions in our company in fiscal 2017 while we strive to reduce the negative impact of changes in our leadership the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and our results of operations in addition hiring training and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming and expensive may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful which could negatively impact future financial results these risks may be exacerbated by the uncertainty associated with the transitions we have experienced over the last few yearsour contracts with the us government include compliance audit and review obligations any failure to meet these obligations could result in civil damages andor penalties being assessed against us by the governmentwe sell products and services through government contracting programs directly and via partners though we no longer hold a gsa contract in the ordinary course of business sales under these government contracting programs may be subject to audit or investigation by the us government noncompliance identified as a result of such

products to our enterprise security segment has enhanced our existing portfolio of threat protection and information protection products while positioning us to provide new cybersecurity solutions that address the everevolving threat landscapein february 2017 we acquired lifelock a provider of proactive identity theft protection services for consumers and consumer risk management services for enterprises the addition of lifelocks identity and fraud protection offerings to our consumer digital safety segment allows us to provide a comprehensive digital safety solution designed to protect information across devices and users in the connected home and family25table of contentssee note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our acquisitionshere are our key financial results for continuing operations in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016consolidated revenue increased by 12 primarily driven by a 22 increase in revenue from our enterprise security segment due to the acquisition of blue coatconsumer digital safety segment revenue remained relatively flat as the nortonbranded product revenue decline of 4 was largely offset by increased revenue of 67 million due to the acquisition of lifelock during fiscal 2017 the nortonbranded product revenue decline improved yearoveryear as we benefited from the shift to subscriptionbased contractsour gross margin decreased four percentage points primarily due to lower relative gross margins on blue coat and lifelock revenue as a result of the impact of acquisitionrelated writedowns of preacquisition deferred revenues additionally our gross margin was negatively impacted by amortization of 122 million of acquired blue coat and lifelock intangible assets and the writeup of acquired inventory of 24 million related to the blue coat acquisitionour operating margin decreased fifteen percentage points primarily due to increased operating expenses as a result of blue coat and lifelock postacquisition operating expenses including stockbased compensation from assumed equity awards and amortization of acquired intangible assets we also incurred acquisitionrelated and integration expenses of 120 million related to the blue coat and lifelock acquisitions in addition restructuring transition and other related costs increased yearoveryear as a result of the implementation of new cost saving initiativescash paid for income taxes increased 779 million primarily due to the onetime payment related to the gain on sale from the divestiture of veritas during fiscal 2016deferred revenue increased 6 to 28 billion from 26 billion as of march 31 2017 and april 1 2016 respectively mainly as a result of our blue coat and lifelock acquisitions the increase was partly offset by the amortization of deferred revenue from veritas retained contractswe expect our operating margin to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including our operating results and the

revenue increased 425 million or 22 primarily due to 427 million in revenue from sales of blue coat network protection products due to the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue as a result of the accounting for the blue coat acquisition we excluded revenue of 116 million in the postacquisition period in addition services revenue increased 16 million while revenue from sales of endpoint management solutions decreased 23 million operating income increased 85 million or 83 primarily due to increased revenue a reduction of expenses from new and ongoing cost savings initiatives and favorable currency fluctuations of 16 million and a decrease in unallocated corporate charges of 22 million these increases were partially offset by increased expenses associated with the blue coat acquisition in the postacquisition period and acquired inventory writeup related to the blue coat acquisition of 24 million2016 compared to 2015 revenue decreased 139 million or 7 primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of 90 million as well as decrease in sales of endpoint management solutions and our mail cloud security products operating income decreased 191 million or 65 primarily due to decreased revenue and increased allocation of stranded costs these stranded costs consist of overhead expenses resulting from the sale of veritas and primarily include information technology infrastructure and services and real estate costs in addition revenue decreased partially due to the impact of the additional week from the 53week fiscal 2015 yearconsumer digital safety

percentage of revenues                    2017 compared to 2016 revenue decreased 6 million primarily due to a decline in revenue from sales of nortonbranded products of 73 million as the revenue generated from customer additions was not sufficient to replace revenue lost through customer attrition the decline was largely offset by a 67 million increase in revenue due to the acquisition of lifelock due to the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue as a result of the accounting for the lifelock acquisition we excluded revenue of 28 million in the postacquisition period while the trend of declining revenues from sales of nortonbranded products continued in fiscal 2017 we began to benefit from the shift to subscriptionbased contracts resulting in a lower decline in fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior two fiscal years operating income decreased 85 million or 9 primarily due to the norton revenue decline coupled with a loss from lifelocks operations lifelocks operating loss was a result of the deferred revenue fair value writedown2016 compared to 2015 revenue decreased 217 million or 11 primarily due to new norton customer acquisition not being sufficient to replace norton customers lost through natural attrition and a reduction in revenue from oem arrangements unfavorable currency fluctuations of 81 million also contributed to the decline in revenue operating income decreased 58 million or 6 primarily due to the decreases in revenue in this segment which were partially offset by reductions in cost of revenue sales and marketing and research and development

well as significant charges related to the integration of blue coat and lifelock see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our restructuring separation transition and other related costsnonoperating expense net by fiscal yearthe following charts are in millions2017 compared to 2016 nonoperating expense net increased 97 million to 162 million from 65 million as of march 31 2017 and april 1 2016 respectively primarily driven by an increase in interest expense of 133 million mainly related to our increased borrowings in fiscal 2017 the nonoperating expense net increase was partially offset by increased income from transition service agreements tsa of 14 million pursuant to which we provided veritas certain limited services see note 8 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our debt and tsas2016 compared to 2015 nonoperating expense net increased 12 million primarily due to net foreign currency remeasurement lossesprovision for income taxes by fiscal yearwe are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and international tax jurisdictions a substantial portion of our international earnings were generated from subsidiaries organized in ireland and singapore our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward 30table of contentsjurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more informationthe following charts are in millions except for percentages                    2017 compared to 2016 the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily driven by tax expense of 11 billion in 2016 for providing us taxes on certain undistributed foreign earnings primarily those attributable to the sale of veritas partially offset by tax expense of 52 million in 2017 related to the loss of tax attributes as a result of restructuring activities2016 compared to 2015 the increase in our effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by 11 billion of tax expense in 2016 for providing us taxes on certain undistributed foreign earnings primarily those attributable to the sale of veritasliquidity and capital resourcessources and uses of cashwe have historically relied on cash flow from operations borrowings under credit facilities issuances of debt and equity securities and sale of business more recently for our liquidity needs as of march 31 2017 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 43 billion of which 9 million is included in our other current assets we also have an unused credit facility of 10 billion resulting in a liquidity position of approximately 53 billion as of march 31 2017 33 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries we have provided us deferred taxes on a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings sufficient to address the incremental us tax that would be due if we needed such portion of these funds to support our operations in the usour principal cash requirements primarily consists of acquisitions payment of taxes operating expenses and working capital capital expenditures payment of principal and interest on debt and restructuring and integration costs also we may engage from time to time in the open market purchase of our notes prior to their maturity furthermore our capital allocation strategy contemplates a quarterly cash dividend in addition we regularly evaluate our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock31table of contentscash flowsthe following charts summarize cash provided by used in our consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal 2015 2016 and 2017 in millionscontinuing operating activitiesour primary source of cash from continuing operating activities has been from cash collections from our customers due to seasonality our orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters we therefore expect cash inflows from continuing operating activities to be affected by fluctuations in billings and timing of collectionsour primary uses of cash from our continuing operating activities include payments for income taxes payments for compensation and related costs payments to our resellers and distribution partners and other general corporate expendituresthe change in continuing operating activities in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the cash payment for taxes of 887 million as a result of the gain on sale from the divestiture of veritas changes in working capital and lower income from continuing operations adjusted for noncash itemsthe change in continuing operating activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to changes in working capital and higher income from continuing operations adjusted for noncash itemsrestructuring plan we initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 to reduce complexity by means of longterm structural improvements we expect to reduce headcount and close certain facilities in connection with this restructuring plan the total remaining cash payments in connection with the restructuring plan are expected to be approximately 270 million to 305 million these actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2018 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our restructuring planscontinuing investing activitiesour investing cash flows consist primarily of acquisitions capital expenditures and investment purchases sales and maturities the change in continuing investing activities in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the net cash consideration paid for our acquisitions of blue coat and lifelock during fiscal 2017 of 45 billion and 22 billion respectively in addition our investing activities decreased due to the absence of proceeds from the divestiture of veritas of 65 billion in fiscal 2016 and reduced proceeds from maturities and sales of shortterm investments of 13 billion the decrease was partially offset by reduced purchases of shortterm investments of 378 million during fiscal 2016the change in continuing investing activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to proceeds received from the divestiture of veritas of 65 billion increased proceeds from maturities and sales of shortterm investments of 331 million and decreases in our purchases of shortterm investments of 14 billiondissenter shares as of march 31 2017 we have accrued 68 million for dissenting shareholders as a result of our lifelock acquisitionshortterm investments in order

stockholders in fiscal 2017 our financing activities provided 53 billion of cash compared to 47 billion use of cash in fiscal 2016 the change in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by our borrowing activities with net proceeds of 61 billion partially offset by reduction in stock repurchases of 14 billion and decrease in quarterly dividend payments from 015 per share in fiscal 2016 to 0075 per share in fiscal 2017 the dividend payments in fiscal 2016 also included a special dividend of 400 per share subsequent to the divestiture of veritas32table of contentsthe change in continuing financing activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to increased cash dividends and dividend equivalent payments of 26 billion increased repurchases of common stock of 13 billion and an increase in the repayment of maturing senior notes and other obligations of 347 million partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes of 500 millionwe have

with customers in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new authoritative guidance for revenue from contracts with customers the standards core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services in doing so companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance these may include identifying performance obligations in the contract estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation in march 2016 the fasb clarified implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in april 2016 the fasb issued guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing which reduces the cost and complexity of applying certain aspects of the guidance both at implementation and on an ongoing basisthe new guidance may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented retrospective or retrospectively with cumulative

value of 23 billion based on level 2 inputswe have considered the historical volatility of interest rates and determined that it is possible that adverse changes in interest rates related to our fixed

compared to a 41 million fair value reduction as of april 1 2016 a reasonably possible hypothetical adverse change of 50basis points in the effective interest rate of our 37 billion of variablerate

worldwide operations and as such we are exposed to foreign currency risk our entities conduct their businesses in the primary local currency in which they operate however they may also conduct business in other currencies to the extent our entities hold monetary assets or liabilities earn revenues or incur costs in currencies other than the entitys functional currency they are exposed to foreign exchange gains or losses and impacts to margins as a result as part of our foreign currency risk mitigation strategy we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts with up to six months in duration to help mitigate foreign exchange risk however we are not able to mitigate all of our foreign exchange risk we have considered historical trends in exchange rates and determined that it is possible that adverse changes in exchange rates for any currency could occur the estimated impacts of a ten percent appreciation or depreciation of foreign currency are as follows in
