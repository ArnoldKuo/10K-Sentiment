  we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  interest rate risk  as of march 29 2013 we had 210 billion in principal amount of fixedrate senior notes outstanding with a carrying amount of 210 billion and a fair value of 219 billion which fair value is based on level 2 inputs of market prices for similar debt instruments and resulting yields we have performed sensitivity analyses as of march 29 2013 by using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 50 bps movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant on march 29 2013 a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate senior notes by a decrease of approximately 57 million and an increase of approximately 59 million respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt    53    table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk  we conduct business in 32 currencies through our worldwide operations and as such we are exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and cash equivalents investments receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary primarily the euro and singapore dollar our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts with up to six months in duration to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates for all currencies could be experienced the estimated impacts of a five or ten percent appreciation or depreciation in value are as follows                                value ofcontractsgiven xappreciation offoreigncurrency     notionalamount     value ofcontractsgiven xdepreciation offoreigncurrency     foreign forward exchange contracts   10     5       5     10        in millions     purchased march 29 2013    321      309      295      279      262     sold march 29 2013    334      349      367      386      408    we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates  equity price risk  in june 2006 we issued 10 billion principal amount of 100 notes due june 2013 the 100 notes have a fixed annual interest rate and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the convertible senior notes however the fair value will increase as interest rates fall andor our common stock price increases and decrease as interest rates rise andor our common stock price decreases the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of the 100 notes but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations the carrying value of the 100 notes was 997 million as of march 29 2013 which represents the liability component of the 10 billion principal balance the total estimated fair value of our 100 notes at march 29 2013 was 129 billion and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price of 129 per 100 of the 100 notes as of that date see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report    54    table of contents
