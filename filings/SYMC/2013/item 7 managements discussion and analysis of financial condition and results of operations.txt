that accounted for more than 10 of our total net revenue in fiscal 2011 one distributor ingram micro accounted for 10 of our total net revenue our distributor arrangements with ingram micro consisted of several nonexclusive independently negotiated agreements with its subsidiaries each of which cover different countries or regions each of these agreements was separately negotiated and was independent of any other contract such as a master distribution agreement and these agreements were not based on the same form of contract  acquisitions  our strategy will be complemented by business combinations that fit strategically and meet specific profitability hurdles our acquisitions are designed to enhance the features and functionality of our existing products and extend our product leadership in core markets we consider timetomarket synergies with existing products and potential market share gains when evaluating the economics of acquisitions of technologies product lines or companies we may acquire or dispose of other technologies products and companies in the future    10    table of contents we did not make any material acquisitions during fiscal 2013 for further discussion of our acquisitions see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report  competition  our markets are consolidating highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the competitive landscape has changed significantly over the past few years with new competition arising much of the market growth has come from startups whose focus is on solving a specific customer issue or delivering a specific nicheoriented product and from larger integration providers that increasingly are looking to put various types of protection whether it is backup high availability or security into their platforms we are focused on delivering comprehensive customer solutions integrating across our broad product portfolio and partnering with other technology providers to differentiate ourselves from the competition we believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry include product quality and effectiveness timetomarket price reputation financial stability breadth of product offerings customer support brand recognition and effective sales and marketing efforts  in addition to the competition we face from direct competitors we face indirect or potential competition from retailers application providers operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products we also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for spending at the retail level and in corporate accounts in addition we compete with other software companies operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems to acquire technologies products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties we also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers and enterprises by oems  the competitive environments for each segment are described below  consumer  most of the channels in which our consumer products are offered are highly competitive our competitors are intensely focused on customer acquisition which has led competitors to offer their technology for free engage in aggressive marketing or enter into competitive partnerships our primary competitors in the consumer segment are mcafee inc owned by intel corporation mcafee and trend micro inc trend micro there are also several freeware providers and regional security companies that we compete against for our consumer backup offerings our primary competitors are carbonite inc and mozy inc owned by emc corporation emc  security and compliance  in the security and management markets we compete against many companies that offer competing products to our solutions our primary competitors in the security and management market are mcafee microsoft corporation microsoft and trend micro there are also several smaller regional security companies with which we compete in the authentication services market our primary competitors are comodo group inc rsa the security division of emc entrust inc and godaddycom inc in the softwareasaservice saas security market our primary competitors are google incs postini services and microsoft our primary competitors in the managed services business are secureworks inc owned by dell inc and verizon communications inc  storage and server management  the markets for storage management backup archiving and ediscovery are intensely competitive our primary competitors are commvault systems inc emc hewlettpackard company ibm oracle and veeam software    11    table of contents intellectual property  protective measures  we regard some of the features of our internal operations software and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures contractual arrangements and other measures to protect our proprietary information our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products services and technology and enhance our competitive position  as part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees distributors and corporate partners and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information these license agreements are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities equipment and networks  trademarks patents copyrights and licenses  symantec and the symantec logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries in addition to symantec and the symantec logo we have used registered or applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions we enforce our trademark service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use  we have more than 1900 patents in addition to foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications which relate to various aspects of our products and technology the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically 17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products  our products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad however these measures may not provide sufficient protection and our intellectual property rights may be challenged in addition we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark license or other intellectual property right  seasonality  as is typical for many large software companies our business is seasonal software license and maintenance orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters a decline in license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to license and maintenance orders in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year in addition we generally receive a higher volume of software license and maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter with orders concentrated in the latter part of that month we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met and because a significant portion of our inperiod revenue comes from our deferred revenue balance    12    table of contents employees  as of march 29 2013 we employed more than 21500 people worldwide approximately 44  of whom reside in the us approximately 7400 employees work in sales and marketing 7200 in research and development 5400 in support and services and 1500 in management

is set forth below the list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock  fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results  we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors including general economic conditions competition product obsolescence technological change shifts in buying patterns financial difficulties and budget constraints of our current and potential customers levels of broadband usage awareness of security threats to it systems and other factors while such factors may in some periods increase product sales fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales if demand for our products and solutions declines whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in buying patterns our revenues and margins would likely be adversely affected  if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance or if we are unable to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends our business and operating results could be adversely affected  our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products product upgrades and services on a timely basis we have in the past incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including            managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements which has frequently been longer than we originally expected            adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers            extending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms operating systems and hardware products such as mobile devices            entering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited experience including the delivery of solutions in an appliance form factor    13    table of contents         managing new product and service strategies including integrating our various security and storage technologies management solutions customer service and support into unified enterprise security and storage solutions            addressing trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship our products            developing or expanding efficient sales channels            obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products including source code licenses for certain products with deep technical integration into operating systems  if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges or if our new products product upgrades and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance our business and operating results could be adversely affected  we operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline  we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business and operating results to compete successfully we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors appropriately respond to competitive strategies and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed used and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands our competitive position and our financial results could be adversely affected  our traditional competitors include independent software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings we expect that competition may intensify as a result of future software industry consolidation in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to endusers of our products we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors products than our products in addition software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform in the future further product development by these vendors could cause our software applications and services to become redundant which could significantly impact our sales and financial results  we face growing competition from network equipment computer hardware manufacturers large operating system providers and other technology companies these firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection and storage and server management software that competes at some levels with our product offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our products  security protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or in some cases is offered free of charge some companies offer the lowerpriced or free security products within their computer hardware or software products that we believe are inferior to our products and saas offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these security products    14    table of contents  as replacing the need for more effective full featured products and services such as those that we provide the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results by causing among other things price reductions of our products reduced profitability and loss of market share  many of our competitors have greater financial technical sales marketing or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment such as intel corporations acquisition of mcafee could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete  our business models present execution and competitive risks  in recent years our saas offerings have become increasingly critical in our business our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying saas offerings for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own saas strategies we cannot assure you that our investments in and development of saas offerings will achieve the expected returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the marketplace in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support saas offerings these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including            continuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloudbased experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share and            ensuring that our saas offerings meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data  our increasing focus on the delivery of products in an appliance form factor creates new business and financial risks  since fiscal 2012 shipments of products to customers in an appliance form factor have represented an increasingly larger part of our revenues and we expect this trend to continue the delivery of solutions in the form of appliances creates new business and financial risks including the following            increased cost of components and contract manufacturing as we do not own our manufacturing facilities            supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers            a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increases our costs andor causes a delay in order fulfillment            excess inventory levels which could lead to writedowns or obsolescence charges            additional reserves for product returns            challenges in managing our channel business            tax and trade compliance complications and            local field support of customers appliances  we cannot assure you that we will continue to have success in our appliance business    15    table of contents we have begun investing in a plan to better meet customer needs through internal innovation and driving faster organic growth with a particular focus on key areas that combine our existing products and services into new solutions that are designed to meet multiple customer needs with integrated higher value offerings and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating results may be harmed  pursuant to our recently announced restructuring plan we have been reallocating talent within our organization and are dedicating spending and resources to focus on certain key areas such as mobile workforce productivity norton protection norton cloud information security services identitycontentaware security gateway data center security business continuity integrated backup cloudbased information management and object storage platform we expect research and development expenses to increase through fiscal 2017 as we invest to drive organic innovation for our customers while we will seek to have the right level of investment and the right level of resources focused on our biggest growth opportunities the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected  over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sales service marketing and manufacturing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results  while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in research and development activities as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected  defects or disruptions in our saas offerings could reduce demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability  our saas offerings may contain errors or defects that users identify after they begin using them that could result in unanticipated service interruptions which could harm our reputation and our business since our customers use our saas offerings for missioncritical protection from threats to electronic information endpoint devices and computer networks any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our saas offerings could significantly harm our reputation and may damage our customers businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation  risks related to the provision of our saas offerings could impair our ability to deliver our services and could expose us to liability damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business  we currently serve our saasbased customers from hosting facilities located across the globe damage to or failure of any significant element of these hosting facilities could result in interruptions in our service which could harm our customers and expose us to liability interruptions or failures in our service delivery could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us could adversely affect our renewal rates and could harm our ability to attract new customers our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that our saas offerings are unreliable as we continue to offer more of our software products in a saasbased delivery model all of these risks could be exacerbated  our saas offerings also involve the storage and transmission of large amounts of our customers proprietary information including sensitive and personally identifiable information breaches of our security measures or the    16    table of contents  accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against such breaches our security measures could be breached at any time and could result in unauthorized third parties obtaining access to our or our customers data any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our saas offerings could reduce sales and constrain consumer and business customer adoption of our saas offering in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further security measures could be significant  if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers our operating results could be adversely affected  we sell our products to customers around the world through multitiered sales and distribution networks sales through these different channels involve distinct risks including the following  direct sales a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to endusers special risks associated with direct sales include            longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts            difficulty in hiring retaining and motivating our direct sales force            substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to become productive in selling our products and services including regular updates to cover new and revised products and associated delays and difficulties in recognizing the expected benefits of investments in new products and updates  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we announced a plan to refocus our direct field sales representatives on generating new business and to create over time a dedicated renewals team transitions of this kind can be disruptive to the sales organization and could exacerbate the risks noted above  indirect sales channels a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels including distributors that sell our products to endusers and other resellers this channel involves a number of risks including            our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to endusers            our resellers and distributors are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers            our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause            our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing products and may from time to time place greater emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing promotions and other terms offered by our competitors            recent consolidation of electronics retailers has increased their negotiating power with respect to hardware and software providers  oem sales channels a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into or bundle our products with their products our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks including            our lack of control over the volume of systems shipped and the timing of such shipments    17    table of contents         our oem partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers            our oem partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due to competitive conditions in our markets and other factors            sales through our oem partners are subject to changes in general economic conditions strategic direction competitive risks and other issues that could result in a reduction of oem sales            the development work that we must generally undertake under our agreements with our oem partners may require us to invest significant resources and incur significant costs with little or no assurance of ever receiving associated revenues            the time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our oem partners to become familiar with our products may make it more difficult to introduce those products to the market            our oem partners may develop market and distribute their own products and market and distribute products of our competitors which could reduce our sales  if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results in addition reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future and could result in adverse operating results in future periods  changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments  in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel reschedule or adjust with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we announced a new strategy designed to drive organic growth simplify our operating model and concentrate our focus on selected key areas we expect this plan to involve significant transitions as we among other things eliminate duplicative organization and operating structures we will incur significant restructuring charges as we implement these activities the changes to our business model may be disruptive and the revised model that we adopt may not be more efficient or effective than the aspects of our business model that are being revised our restructuring activities including any related charges and related headcount reduction could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition    18    table of contents we are currently planning and designing information systems enhancements and problems with the design or implementation of these enhancements could interfere with our business and operations  we are currently in the process of significantly enhancing our information systems including planning and designing a new enterprise resource planning system the implementation of significant enhancements to information systems is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise which may especially be the case for us due to the size and complexity of our businesses any disruptions relating to our systems enhancements particularly any disruptions impacting our operations during the design or implementation periods could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide services and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business even if we do not encounter these adverse effects the planning designing and implementation may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully plan design or implement the information systems enhancements as planned our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted  we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions which gives rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results  we have in the past acquired and we expect to acquire in the future other businesses business units and technologies acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and challenges including            complexity time and costs associated with the integration of acquired business operations workforce products and technologies            diversion of management time and attention            loss or termination of employees including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employees            assumption of liabilities of the acquired business including litigation related to the acquired business            the addition of acquisitionrelated debt as well as increased expenses and working capital requirements            dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders            substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses writeoff of inprocess research and development impairment of goodwill amortization of intangible assets and stockbased compensation expense  if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects to integrate acquired businesses we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from our acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities  as a result of the sale of our 100 convertible senior notes

into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of 1 billion from time to time in the future we may also incur indebtedness in addition to the amount available under our credit facility the maintenance of our debt levels could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of certain corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

their existing hardware or operating environments which upgrades are often a catalyst for new purchases of our software or purchase services customers may also have difficulties in obtaining the requisite thirdparty financing to complete the purchase of our products and services an adverse macroeconomic environment could also subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us or delay paying us for previously purchased products and services accordingly reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase in addition weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us or experience other financial difficulties this would further increase our credit risk exposure and potentially cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers  in addition the onset or continuation of adverse economic conditions may make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations investing activities including potential acquisitions or financing activities specific economic trends such as declines in the demand for pcs servers and other computing devices or softness in corporate information technology spending could have an even more direct and harmful impact on our business  our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our management  we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us including engineering sales customer support and production we plan to expand our international operations but such expansion is contingent upon our identification of growth opportunities our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations including            potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws or that may not be adequately enforced            requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operations            regulations or restrictions on the use import or export of encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications            local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations            central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the us            fluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and inflationary conditions could reduce our customers ability to obtain financing for software products or that could make our products more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries    20    table of contents         limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations            longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable            difficulties in staffing managing and operating our international operations including difficulties related to administering our stock plans in some foreign countries            difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations            seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in europe and in other periods in other countries            costs and delays associated with developing software and providing support in multiple languages            political unrest war or terrorism or regional natural disasters particularly in areas in which we have facilities  a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us are denominated in foreign currencies accordingly our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates we expect to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the united states continue to increase  the level of corporate tax from sales to our nonus customers is generally less than the level of tax from sales to our us customers this benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits  our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments systems applications and configurations which could result in errors or product failures  because we offer very complex products undetected errors failures or bugs may occur especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released our products are often installed and used in largescale computing environments with different operating systems system management software and equipment and networking configurations which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors failures or bugs in our products our customers computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and nonstandard configurations that make prerelease testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and timeconsuming in addition despite testing by us and others errors failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments in the past we have discovered software errors failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and in some cases have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors  errors failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity damage to our brand product returns loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products loss of competitive position or claims by customers or others many of our enduser customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other less critical software products in addition if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our enduser customers systems regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results    21    table of contents if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology our financial results could be harmed  most of our software and underlying technology is

distribute and sell our proprietary information without authorization  third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents our shrinkwrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions furthermore the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers in addition any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in alone or through our alliances with the business software alliance bsa or the software amp information industry association siia could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us which could adversely affect our operating results  in january 2012 we became aware of disclosure of the source code for 2006era versions of certain of our norton and pcanywhere products which we believe was the result of a theft of source code that occurred in 2006 any unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code could result in the loss of future trade secret protection for that source code this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue operating margins results of operations and cash flows as well as our reputation unauthorized disclosure of our source code also could increase the security risks described under our software products saas offerings and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales below  from time to time we are a party to class action and other lawsuits which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and which could if not determined favorably negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  we have been named as a party to class action lawsuits and we may be named in additional litigation the expense of defending such litigation may be costly and divert managements attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows in addition an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business results of operations and cash flows  third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products  from time to time we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others including claims regarding patents copyrights and trademarks because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that the number of these claims may grow in addition former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to stop selling delay shipments of or redesign our products pay monetary amounts as damages enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification    22    table of contents  obligations that we have with some of our customers we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk  in addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability this liability or our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results  our software products saas offerings and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales  despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and other intentional disruptions of our products and offerings we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products and offerings and harm our reputation as a company similarly experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our website and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products and our customers may assert claims against us related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims  fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the future  our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors our stock price could be negatively affected any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance  factors associated with our industry the operation of our business and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate including            reduced demand for any of our products            entry of new competition into our markets            competitive pricing pressure for one or more

operating systems            weakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry conditions in any of the multiple markets in which we operate that could reduce customer demand and ability to pay for our products and services            political and military instability which could slow spending within our target markets delay sales cycles and otherwise adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and operate effectively            budgetary constraints of customers which are influenced by corporate earnings and government budget cycles and spending objectives            disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused by among other things earthquakes floods or other natural disasters affecting our headquarters located in silicon valley california an

pandemic  any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly  some of our products contain open source software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business  certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled open source licenses which may include by way of example the gnu general public license gpl gnu lesser general public license lgpl the mozilla public license the bsd license and the apache license some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business  if we are unable to adequately address increased customer demands on our technical support services our relationships with our customers and our financial results may be adversely affected  we offer technical support services with many of our products we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers further customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results    24    table of contents we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers if these companies experience financial difficulties do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted which could materially harm our relationships with these customers  accounting charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results  our financial results have been in the past and may continue to be in the future materially affected by noncash and other accounting charges including            amortization of intangible assets            impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets            stockbased compensation expense            restructuring charges            loss on sale of a business and similar writedowns of assets held for sale  for example during fiscal 2009 we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 74 billion resulting in a significant net loss for the year goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant as we determined they did in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and our evaluation depends to a large degree on estimates and assumptions made by our management our assessment of any impairment of goodwill is based on a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of that reporting unit our determination of fair value relies on managements assumptions of our future revenues operating costs and other relevant factors if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other key assumptions such as the discount rate applied to future operating results the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units could change significantly which could result in a goodwill impairment charge in addition we evaluate our other longlived assets including intangible assets whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that the value of these assets might be impaired if we determine that impairment has occurred we could incur an impairment charge against the value of these assets  the foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred in connection with or as a result of other business acquisitions the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by the foregoing accounting charges  we sell products to the us government under contracts that include special compliance obligations and subject us to audits and reviews by various agencies of the us government any failure to meet these obligations or an adverse outcome in an audit or investigation could result in civil damages andor penalties being assessed against us by the government  we have sold products through our us general services administration multiple award schedule contract no gs35f0240t effective january 24 2007 the gsa schedule contract our gsa schedule contract contains provisions that require us to provide customers purchasing through that contract with negotiated favorable pricing as compared to certain nonfederal customers and requires us to monitor aspects of our commercial sales practices to ensure compliance with that pricing obligation in the ordinary course of business sales under our gsa schedule contract may be subject to audit andor investigation by the us government noncompliance with the provisions of the contract identified as a result of such reviews as well as noncompliance identified on our own could subject us to damages and other penalties which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition    25    table of contents on june 4 2012 we were advised by the commercial litigation branch of the department of justices civil division and the civil division of the us attorneys office for the district of columbia that the government is investigating our compliance with certain provisions of our gsa schedule contract including provisions relating to pricing country of origin accessibility and the disclosure of commercial sales practices the department of justice has requested that we preserve among other things all records relating to gsa schedule contracting activity as reported on the gsas publiclyavailable database our total sales under the gsa schedule contract were approximately 210 million from the period beginning january 2007 and ending december 2011  we are cooperating with the investigation and we are unable at this time to predict the likely outcome it is possible that the investigation could lead to claims or findings of violations of the false claims act in connection with our gsa contracting activity violations of the false claims act could result in the imposition of damages including up to treble damages plus civil penalties in some cases to the extent the investigation leads to any such claims or findings the cost to resolve this matter would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition any negative publicity related to our government customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of the outcome of this matter may also damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts  if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees lose key personnel fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully or fail to manage our employee base effectively we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products and services effectively manage or expand our business or increase our revenues  our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management technical sales marketing finance and other personnel our officers and other key personnel are employeesatwill and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of equity based compensation as compensation expense as a result we may decide to issue fewer equitybased incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees or conversely if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions our business and operating results could be adversely affected  from time to time key personnel leave our company while we strive to reduce the negative impact of such changes the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and the results of our operations in addition hiring training and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful which could negatively impact future revenues  our effective tax rate may increase which could increase our income tax expense and reduce increase our net income loss  our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including            changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates            changing tax laws regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings    26    table of contents         the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods            tax assessments or any related tax interest or penalties that could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place  the price of our common stock could decline if our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate  we report our results of operations based on our determination of the aggregate amount of taxes owed in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate from time to time we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction has determined that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities we are engaged in disputes of this nature at this time if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected  our stock price may be volatile in

results of operations  overview  our business  symantec is a global leader in security backup and availability solutions our innovative products and services protect people and information in any digital environment  from the smallest mobile device to the enterprise data center to cloudbased systems our software and services protect against advanced threats independent of the device and environment in which information is used or stored  fiscal calendar  we have a 5253week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to march 31 unless otherwise stated references to years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended march 29 2013 march 30 2012 and april 1 2011 fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 each consisted of 52 weeks our 2014 fiscal year will consist of 52 weeks and will end on march 28 2014  strategy  we are in the midst of a transformation new types of solutions and new market opportunities are emerging as customers look to us to innovate across a digital landscape that has expanded enormously for both consumers and businesses as we think about our markets today it is very clear that the industry needs a new model for protection we are transitioning from being devicecentric which meant protecting endpoints and the data center to having the broader focus of protecting and managing digital information individuals businesses and other organizations use new ways to access their digital information creating new opportunities for us to develop products and services which address mobile devices web services web platforms and the emerging software defined data center and network our strategy is to establish leadership in this evolving informationcentric world by identifying and delivering solutions that solve large unmet or underserved customer needs while building competitive advantage and creating sustainable financial performance  to successfully implement our strategy we are focusing on three areas developing innovative products and services changing our gotomarket gtm strategy and simplifying our organization for information regarding risks associated with our international operations see item 1 business  financial implications of new strategy  fiscal 2014 will include significant transitions as we seek to improve our growth capabilities develop our dedicated renewals team refocus our direct field sales representatives on new business eliminate duplicative organization and operating structures and right size the company our income and cash flows are expected to be impacted by severance charges and capital expenditures as we invest in our people processes and technology to execute our organic growth strategy in the next fiscal year  our operating segments  our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services distinguished by customer needs since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we have operated in five operating segments consumer security and compliance storage and server management services and other as a result of the new strategy we will analyze our operations and organization structure and modify our segment reporting structure as necessary    32    table of contents financial results and trends  revenue increased by 176 million for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily driven by growth in our security and compliance and storage and server management segments our revenue grew both domestically and internationally in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 for fiscal 2013 we experienced the highest growth in revenue on a percentage basis in the asia pacific and japan region followed by the americas the emea region remained flat despite macroeconomic challenges in the european economy fluctuations in the us dollar compared to foreign currencies unfavorably impacted our international revenue by 141 million for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012  cost of revenue increased by 93 million for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to our initiative to improve customer support resulting in higher technical support costs the increasing costs associated with major oem partners as part of certain revenuesharing arrangements and the additional direct costs associated with our appliance business  operating expenses remained consistent as a percentage of revenue while we continued to focus on investing in product development and increasing compensation costs due to headcount additions coupled with effectively managing our cost structure we experienced favorable foreign currency effects on our operating expenses of 98 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as we continue to reallocate talent within our organization and are dedicating spending and resources to focus on certain key areas we expect research and development expenses to increase through fiscal 2017 as we invest to drive organic innovation for our customers furthermore we will incur significant restructuring charges as we eliminate duplicative organization and operating structures these restructuring activities are expected to be completed in fiscal 2014 and we expect to incur total severance and benefit costs between 220 million and 250 million  critical accounting estimates  the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates including judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly historically our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results however actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions if actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of income and in certain situations could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition  a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact our operating results or financial condition we believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see also note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  revenue recognition  we recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition and any applicable amendments or modifications revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates    33    table of contents for software arrangements that include multiple elements including perpetual software licenses and maintenance or services packaged products with content updates and subscriptions we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our standalone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance consumer product content updates managed security services subscriptions and arrangements where vsoe does not exist deferred revenue totaled approximately 40 billion as of march 29 2013 of which 521 million was classified as longterm deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time  for arrangements that include both software and nonsoftware elements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and nonsoftware deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vsoe ii thirdparty evidence of selling price tpe and iii best estimate of the selling price esp when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe we use esp to allocate the arrangement fees to the deliverables  for our consumer products that include content updates we recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sellthrough to endusers as the subscription period commences on the date of sale to the enduser we defer revenue and cost of revenue amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and resellers  we expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends we ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid purchase orders our distributors and resellers base the quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand which may exceed the expected level of a four or six week supply we offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply we estimate reserves for product returns as described below we typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels  arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance subscription or service period  reserves for product returns we reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue based primarily on historical trends we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue actual product returns may be different than what was estimated these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates  reserves for rebates we estimate and record reserves for channel and enduser rebates as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue for consumer products that include content updates rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue or deferred revenue over the term of the subscription our estimated reserves for channel    34    table of contents  volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs which are typically entered into quarterly our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs actual sales during the promotion the amount of actual redemptions received historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the value of the rebate we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates if actual redemptions differ from our estimates material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented  valuation of goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets  business combination valuations when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to            cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future            expected costs to develop the inprocess research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed            the acquired companys brand and competitive position as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio            cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset and            discount rates  these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities  goodwill impairment we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable at the reporting unit level our reporting units are the same as our operating segments a qualitative assessment is first made to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative testing this initial assessment includes among others consideration of i past current and projected future earnings and equity ii recent trends and market conditions and iii valuation metrics involving similar companies that are publiclytraded and acquisitions of similar companies if available if this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that impairment exists a second step is taken involving a comparison between the estimated fair values of our reporting units with their respective carrying amounts including goodwill the methods for estimating operating unit values include asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and a third step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the third step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting units over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets less liabilities if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess  the process of estimating the fair value and carrying value of our reporting units equity requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis many assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable and property and equipment are not specifically allocated to an individual reporting unit and therefore we apply    35    table of contents  judgment to allocate the assets and liabilities and this allocation affects the carrying value of the respective reporting units similarly we use judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units based on relative fair values the use of relative fair values has been necessary for certain reporting units due to changes in our operating structure in prior years to determine a reporting units fair value we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit we evaluate the reasonableness of this approach by comparing it with the market approach which involves a review of the carrying value of our assets relative to our market capitalization and to the valuation of publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business  applying the income approach requires that we make a number of important estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of each reporting unit based on historical and forecasted revenue and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future revenue and expense growth rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit and may change from year to year changes in these key estimates and assumptions or in other assumptions used in this process could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year  as of march 29 2013 our goodwill balance was 58 billion amongst our reporting units based on a qualitative impairment analysis performed on december 29 2012 we determined that it was more likely than not that there was no impairment in any of our reporting units  a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could affect our financial condition operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include            a prolonged global economic crisis            a significant decrease in the demand for our products            the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner            a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate            an adverse action or assessment by a regulator            successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets            a loss of key personnel            our determination to dispose of one or more of our reporting units            the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and            recognition of a goodwill impairment loss  intangible asset impairment we assess the impairment of identifiable finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset groups carrying amount may not be recoverable recoverability of certain finitelived intangible assets particularly customer relationships and finitelived trade names would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to which the assets are assigned to the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows the asset group is expected to generate if an asset is considered to be impaired the amount of such impairment would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value recoverability and impairment of other finitelived intangible assets particularly developed technology and patents would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of undiscounted estimated future product revenues offset by estimated future costs to dispose of the product to which the asset relates for indefinitelived intangible assets we review impairment on an annual basis consistent with the timing of the annual evaluation for goodwill these assets generally include trade names and trademarks similar to goodwill impairment testing a qualitative assessment is first made to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative testing this initial    36    table of contents  assessment includes consideration of among other things i past current and projected future revenues ii recent trends and market conditions including discount rates and iv valuation metrics such as royalty rates involving similar companies that are publiclytraded if available if this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that impairment exists a second step is taken this step involves a comparison between the fair values of the assets and their respective carrying amounts any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be recognized as an impairment charge our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted future revenue operating costs and other relevant factors assumptions and estimates about the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are subjective and are affected by changes to our business strategies if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimate of the fair value of our identifiable intangible assets could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition  longlived assets we assess longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the longlived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we assess recoverability of longlived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model if an asset is not recoverable impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition we record impairment charges on longlived assets held for sale when we determine that the carrying value of the longlived assets may not be recoverable in determining fair value we obtain and consider market value appraisal information from third parties  stockbased compensation  we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance stockbased compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the respective award  determining the fair value of stockbased awards primarily stock options at the grant date requires judgment we use the blackscholesmerton option pricing model bsm model to determine the fair value of stock options the determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the options actual and projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends  we estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and postvesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options the risk free interest rate is equal to the us treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life for all historical periods presented we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock and therefore our expected dividend rate was zero for all such periods presented for information regarding a subsequent event announcing the declaration of a quarterly dividend see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report  we issue performancebased restricted stock units prus and performancecontingent stock units pcsus representing hypothetical shares of our common stock each pru and pcsu grant reflects a target number of shares that may be issued to the award recipient the actual number of prus the recipient receives is determined at the end of a threeyear performance period as follows 1 our achievement of an annual target    37    table of contents  earnings per share for the first fiscal year of grant and 2 our two and three year cumulative relative total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies that are included in the standard amp poors 500 index the pcsus vest based upon the performance of symantecs common stock over a threeyear period and are also subject to an underlying continued service vesting condition we estimate the fair value of prus using the monte carlo simulation option pricing model monte carlo model as the total shareholder return modifier contains a market condition we estimate the fair value and derived service period of pcsus using the monte carlo model as this statistical model can simulate a range of possible future stock prices for symantec  in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation we record stockbased compensation expense for awards that are expected to vest as a result judgment is required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience actual forfeitures may differ if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted when we record an adjustment for the difference in the period that the awards vest or are forfeited  contingencies and litigation  we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or legal proceedings as well as potential ranges of probable losses when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable a determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required if any for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter because of uncertainties related to these matters we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position  income taxes  we are required to compute our income taxes in each federal state and international jurisdiction in which we operate this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or longterm deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets our judgments assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income  our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding indefinitely reinvested earnings outside the united states material changes in our estimates of such earnings or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of such earnings could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate if certain foreign earnings previously treated as indefinitely reinvested outside the united states are repatriated the related us tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings  we account for uncertain tax positions pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure those positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax    38    table of contents  benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the refinement of estimates or the realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which such determination is made  we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance if required the determination of our valuation allowance involves assumptions judgments and estimates including forecasted earnings future taxable income and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income  results of operations  total net revenue

benefits 1 17 million tax benefits arising from the veritas 2002 through 2005 irs appeals matters including adjustments to state liabilities and a reduction of interest accrued 2 13 million in tax benefits resulting from tax settlements and adjustments to prior year items 3 10 million from lapses of statutes of limitation and 4 2 million for the benefit of the    46    table of contents  research credit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 resulting from the extension of the federal research credit as part of the 2012 taxpayer relief act these tax benefits were offset by a 9 million

million from the reduction of our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and 3 21 million tax benefit from lapses of statutes of limitation and 4 7 million tax benefit from the conclusion of us and foreign audits  the effective tax rate for all periods presented otherwise reflects the benefits of lowertaxed international earnings and losses from our joint venture with huawei technologies co limited domestic manufacturing incentives and research and development credits partially offset by state income taxes pretax income from international operations was significantly higher in fiscal 2012 due to the sale of our 49 ownership interest in the joint venture to huawei on march 30 2012 for 526 million a significant portion of the sale proceeds was attributable to international tax jurisdictions resulting in a 20 tax rate on the sale of the joint venture reducing the overall tax rate in fiscal 2012 by 3  we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and international tax jurisdictions a substantial portion of our international earnings were generated from subsidiaries organized in ireland and singapore our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict  for further information on the impact of foreign earnings on our effective tax rate see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  see critical accounting estimates above for additional information about our provision for income taxes  in assessing the ability to realize our deferred tax assets we considered whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we considered the following we have historical cumulative book income as measured by the current and prior two years we have strong consistent taxpaying history we have substantial us federal income tax carryback potential and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in part i item 1a risk factors set forth in this annual report we have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and thus that the deferred tax assets as of march 29 2013 of 402 million after application of the valuation allowances described above are realizable on a more likely than not basis  on december 10 2009 the us tax court issued its opinion in veritas v commissioner finding that our transfer pricing methodology with appropriate adjustments was the best method for assessing the value of the transaction at issue between veritas and its international subsidiary in the 2000 to 2001 tax years in june 2010 we reached an agreement with the irs concerning the amount of the adjustment based on the us tax court decision as a result of the agreement we reduced our liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting in a 39 million tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 in march 2011 we reached agreement with irish    47    table of contents  revenue concerning compensating adjustments arising from this matter resulting in an additional 10 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 this matter has now been closed and no further adjustments to the accrued liability are expected  on december 2 2009 we received a revenue agents report from the irs for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years assessing additional taxes due we contested 80 million of the tax assessed and all penalties as a result of negotiations with irs appeals in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we remeasured our liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting in a tax benefit of 52 million we executed the final closing agreement for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years on december 26 2012 accordingly we recorded a further tax benefit of 3 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 based on the closing agreement further we amended our state tax returns for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 to reflect the adjustments in the closing agreement and remeasured our state liability resulting in a benefit of 7 million  the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year although potential resolution of uncertain tax positions involve multiple tax periods and jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both in the next 12 months by between 15 million and 130 million depending on the nature of the settlement or expiration of statutes of limitations we estimate at least 15 million could affect our income tax provision and therefore benefit the resulting effective tax rate as of march 29 2013 we have 76 million on deposit with the irs pertaining to us tax matters in the symantec 2005 through 2008 audit cycle  we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing tax controversies and the impact if any of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions  noncontrolling interest  in fiscal 2011 we completed the acquisition of the identity and authentication business of verisign

ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us in addition our bylaws contain indemnification obligations to our directors officers employees and agents and we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers to give such directors and officers additional contractual assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in our bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers it is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements might not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our consolidated financial statements  we provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party historically payments made under these provisions have been immaterial we monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred  recently issued authoritative guidance  in december 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update that will require us to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements associated with    52    table of contents  certain financial and derivative instruments to enable users of our financial statements to better understand the effect of those arrangements on our financial position in january 2013 the fasb issued another update to clarify the scope of the related instruments in which the standard applies to bifurcated embedded derivatives repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions the new guidance will be applicable to us on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we do not expect that this guidance will materially impact our disclosures included in our consolidated financial statements  in january 2013 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that will require us to release cumulative translation adjustment cta into earnings when an entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a consolidated foreign entity and the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity for sales of an equity method investment in a foreign entity a pro rata portion of cta attributable to the equity method investment would be recognized in earnings upon sale of the investment when a parent entity sells either a part or all of its investment in a consolidated foreign entity cta would be recognized in earnings only if the parent no longer has a controlling financial interest in the foreign entity as a result of the sale in addition cta would be recognized in earnings upon a business combination achieved in stages the update will be effective on a prospective basis for events beginning in our 2015 fiscal year and applies to all interim periods we do not expect that this guidance will materially impact our consolidated financial statements  in february 2013 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that requires entities to present reclassifications by component when reporting changes in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci balances for significant items reclassified out of aoci to net income in their entirety entities are required to report the effect on the line items in the income statement either on the face of the income statement or in the notes for significant items not reclassified to net income in their entirety entities must crossreference in the notes to the other disclosures that already provide information about those amounts this new guidance will be adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 on a prospective basis we do not expect that this guidance will materially impact our consolidated financial statements
