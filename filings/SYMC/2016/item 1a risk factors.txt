enhance the features and functionality of our existing products and extend our product leadership in core markets we consider timetomarket synergies with existing products and potential market share gains when evaluating the economics of acquisitions of technologies product lines or companies we may acquire or dispose of other technologies products and companies in the futurewe did not make any material acquisitions during fiscal 2016competitionour markets are consolidating highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the competitive landscape has changed significantly over the past few years with new competition arising much of the market growth has come from startups whose focus is on solving a specific customer issue or delivering a nicheoriented product and from larger integration providers that increasingly are looking to put various types of protection into their platforms we are focused on delivering comprehensive customer solutions integrating across our broad product portfolio and partnering with other technology providers to differentiate ourselves from the competition we believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry include product quality and effectiveness timetomarket price reputation financial stability breadth of product offerings customer support brand recognition and effective sales and marketing effortsin addition to the competition we face from direct competitors we face indirect or potential competition from retailers application providers operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products we also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for spending at the retail level and in corporate accounts in addition we compete with other software companies operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems to acquire technologies products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties we also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers and enterprises by oemsmost of the channels in which our products are offered are highly competitive some of our consumer competitors are intensely focused on customer acquisition which has led competitors to offer their technology for free engage in aggressive marketing or enter into competitive partnerships our primary security competitors are intel corporation microsoft corporation microsoft and trend micro inc there are also several freeware providers and regional security companies that we compete against for our consumer backup offerings our primary competitors are carbonite inc and emc corporation in the secure socket layer certificate market our primary competitors are comodo group inc and godaddycom inc in the saas security market our primary competitors are proofpoint

our internal operations software and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures contractual arrangements and other measures to protect our proprietary information our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products services and technology and enhance our competitive positionas part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees distributors and corporate partners and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information these license agreements are generally nontransferable and have either a perpetual or subscription based time limited term we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities equipment and networkstrademarks patents copyrights and licensessymantec and the

trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions we enforce our trademark service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in usewe have more than 1700 patents in addition to foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications which relate to various aspects of our products and technology the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically 17 years from the date of issuance of the

appropriate proprietary rights notices and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad however these measures may not provide sufficient protection and our intellectual property rights may be challenged in addition we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark license or other intellectual property rightseasonalityas is typical for many large technology companies our business is seasonal orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met and because a significant portion of our inperiod revenue comes from our deferred revenue

the public reference room item 1a risk factorsa description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below the list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stockif we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limitedfor the last few years we have experienced a number of transitions as we have attempted to revitalize our business model improve execution and innovate new products and services these transitions have involved significant turnover in management and other key personnel changes in our strategic direction and more recently the divestiture of veritas transitions of the magnitude we have experienced and are experiencing can be disruptive result in loss of institutional focus and employee morale and make the execution of business strategies more difficult we are also focused on addressing dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the continued decline in the pc market the market shifts towards mobility the transition towards cloudbased solutions and architectural shifts in the provision of security all of which has made it more difficult for us to compete effectively and requires us to improve our product and service offerings we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with these efforts and the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our businesswe may not achieve the intended benefits of the divestiture of veritason january 29 2016 we completed the divestiture of veritas however we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the transaction the resource constraints as a result of our prior focus on completing the transaction which included the loss of employees could have a continuing impact on the execution of our business strategy and our overall operating results additionally in connection with the divestiture our board of directors committed to returning the proceeds of the sale of veritas to stockholders in the form of a capital return program which included the payment of a special dividend in march 2016 entry into multiple share accelerated transactions and continued repurchases under current and future share repurchase programs the use of proceeds in this manner could impair the companys future financial growth8table of contentsfluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial resultswe are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors including market transitions general economic conditions competition product obsolescence technological change shifts in buying patterns financial difficulties and budget constraints of our current and potential customers awareness of security threats to it systems and other factors while such factors may in some periods increase product sales fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales if demand for our products and solutions declines whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in buying patterns our revenues and margins would likely be adversely affectedour business depends on customers renewing their arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offeringsa large portion of our revenue is derived from arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings yet existing customers have no contractual obligation to purchase additional solutions after the initial subscription or contract period our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our solutions or our customer support customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions compared with the solutions offered by our competitors any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected if at all accordingly we must invest significant time and resources in providing ongoing value to our customers if these efforts fail or if our customers do not renew for other reasons or if they renew on terms less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business will sufferany cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect and these actions may adversely affect our business in may 2016 we announced a fiscal 2017 restructuring plan to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2018 this initiative could result in disruptions to our operations any costcutting measures could also negatively impact our business by delaying the introduction of new products or technologies interrupting service of additional products or impacting employee retention in addition we cannot be sure that the cost reduction and streamlining initiatives will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or streamlining if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses our results of operations will sufferif we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance or if we are unable to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends our business and operating results could be adversely affectedour future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products product upgrades and services on a timely basis we have in the past incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive additionally we must continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space the continued decline in the pc market and the market shift towards mobility and the increasing transition towards cloudbased solutions all of which have made it more difficult for us to compete effectively customers may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have our failure to develop solutions that satisfy customer preferences in a timely and costeffective manner may harm our ability to renew our subscriptions with existing customers and to create or increase demand for our solutions and may adversely impact our operating results new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges includingmanaging the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements which has frequently been longer than we originally expectedadapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customersextending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms operating systems and hardware products such as mobile devicesentering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited experiencemanaging new product and service strategies for the markets in which we operateaddressing trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship our productsdeveloping or expanding efficient sales channels andobtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products including source code 9table of contentslicenses for certain products with deep technical integration into operating systemsif we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges or if our new products product upgrades and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance our business and operating results could be adversely affectedwe operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to declinewe operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business and operating results to compete successfully we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors appropriately respond to competitive strategies and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed used and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands our competitive position and our financial results could be adversely affectedour competitors include software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to endusers of our products we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors products than our products in addition software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform in the future further product development by these vendors could cause our software applications and services to become redundant which could significantly impact our sales and financial resultswe face growing competition from network equipment computer hardware manufacturers large operating system providers and other technology companies that are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection software that competes at some levels with our product offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our productssecurity protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or in some cases is offered free of charge some companies offer the lowerpriced or free security products within their computer hardware or software products that we believe are inferior to our products and saas offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these security products as replacing the need for more effective full featured products and services such as those that we provide the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results by causing among other things price reductions of our products reduced profitability and loss of market sharemany of our competitors have greater financial technical sales marketing or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we competefluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the future our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors our stock price could be negatively affected any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance factors associated with our industry the operation of our business and the markets for our products may

the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly our business models present execution and competitive risksin recent years our saas offerings have become increasingly critical in our business our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying saas offerings for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own saas strategies we cannot assure you that our investments in and development of saas offerings will achieve the expected returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the marketplace in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support saas offerings these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this business model depends on our execution in a number of areas includingcontinuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloudbased experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share andensuring that our saas offerings meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their datawe may need to change our pricing models to compete successfullythe intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact pricing in both our onpremise enterprise software business and our cloud business as well as overall demand for our onpremise 11table of contentssoftware product and service offerings which could reduce our revenues and profitability our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings which could put pressure on us to further discount our product or support pricing any broadbased change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products if we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand our revenues could decrease the increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing modelsdefects disruptions or risks related to the provision of our saas offerings could impair our ability to deliver our services and could expose us to liability damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our businessour saas offerings may contain errors or defects that users identify after they begin using them that could result in unanticipated service interruptions which could harm our reputation and our business since our customers use our saas offerings for missioncritical protection from threats to electronic information endpoint devices and computer networks any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our saas offerings could significantly harm our reputation and may damage our customers businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigationwe currently serve our saasbased customers from hosting facilities located across the globe damage to or failure of any significant element of these hosting facilities could result in interruptions in our service which could harm our customers and expose us to liability interruptions or failures in our service delivery could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us could adversely

commitments could harm our businessthe personal information we collect use store or disclose collectively process including from employees and customers is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security as well as contractual commitments any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions fines litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business our customers may also accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a device that is lost or stolen creating the perception that our systems are not secure against thirdparty access additionally if third parties that we work with such as vendors or developers violate applicable laws or our policies such violations may also place personal information at risk and have an adverse effect on our business changes to applicable privacy or data security laws could impact how we process personal information and therefore limit the effectiveness of our products services or features or our ability to develop new products services or featuresif we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers our operating results could be adversely affectedwe sell our products to customers around the world through multitiered sales and distribution networks sales through these different channels involve distinct risks including the followingdirect sales a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to endusers special risks associated with direct sales includelonger sales cycles associated with direct sales effortsdifficulty in hiring retaining and motivating our direct sales force particularly through periods of transition in our organization andsubstantial amounts of training for sales representatives to become productive in selling our products and services including regular updates to cover new and revised products and associated delays and difficulties in recognizing the expected benefits of investments in new products and updatesindirect sales channels a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels including distributors that sell our products to endusers and other resellers this channel involves a number of risks includingour lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to endusers12table of contentsour resellers and distributors are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customersour reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without causeour resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing products and may from time to time place greater emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing promotions and other terms offered by our competitors andthe consolidation of electronics retailers has increased their negotiating power with respect to hardware and software providers such as usoem sales channels a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into or bundle our products with their products our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks includingour lack of control over the volume of systems shipped and the timing of such shipmentsour oem partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customersour oem partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due to competitive conditions in our markets and other factorssales through our oem partners are subject to changes in general economic conditions strategic direction competitive risks and other issues that could result in a reduction of oem salesthe development work that we must generally undertake under our agreements with our oem partners may require us to invest significant resources and incur significant costs with little or no assurance of ever receiving associated revenuesthe time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our oem partners to become familiar with our products may make it more difficult to introduce those products to the market andour oem partners may develop market and distribute their own products and market and distribute products of our competitors which could reduce our salesif we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results in addition reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future and could result in adverse operating results in future periodsover the long term we intend to invest in research and development activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating resultswhile we continue to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest significantly in research and development activities as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation in each of our business segments we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position we recognize the costs associated with these research and development investments earlier than the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affectedchanges in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairmentsin response to changes in industry and market conditions and in connection with the recent divestiture of veritas we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel reschedule or adjust with contract manufacturers and suppliers 13table of contentsfurther our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earningsour inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our businesswe are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers for example we host many of our products using thirdparty data center facilities and we do not control the operation of these facilities these facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they are also subject to breakins computer viruses sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our products and servicesfurthermore our business administration human resources and finance services depend on the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations a disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster or other business continuity event could cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers in addition we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis which could adversely affect the trading value of our stock although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backedup there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient mannerany errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our products and services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers businesses for example we may experience disruptions outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors including infrastructure changes human or software errors capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our website simultaneously fraud or security attacks in some instances we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time interruptions in our products and services could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us in addition our business would be harmed if any of events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our services are unreliable our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose customer data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenariowe have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions which gives rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial resultswe have in the past acquired and we expect to acquire in the future other businesses business units and technologies acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and challenges includingcomplexity time and costs associated with the integration of acquired business operations workforce products and technologiesdiversion of management time and attentionloss or termination of employees including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employeesassumption of liabilities of the acquired business including litigation related to the acquired businessthe addition of acquisitionrelated debt as well as increased expenses and working capital requirementsdilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders andsubstantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses writeoff of inprocess research and development impairment of goodwill amortization of intangible assets and stockbased compensation expenseif integration of our acquired businesses is not successful we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects to integrate acquired businesses we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positionsany of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from our acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions14table of contentsour international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our managementwe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us including engineering sales customer support and production we plan to expand our international operations but such expansion is contingent upon our identification of growth opportunities our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations includingpotential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws or that may not be adequately enforcedrequirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operationsregulations or restrictions on the use import or export of encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communicationslocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulationscentral bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the usfluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and inflationary conditions could reduce our customers ability to obtain financing for software products or could make our products more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countrieslimitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operationslonger payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivabledifficulties in staffing managing and operating our international operations including difficulties related to administering our stock plans in some foreign countriesdifficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operationsseasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in europe and in other periods in other countriescosts and delays associated with developing software and providing support in multiple languages andpolitical unrest war or terrorism or regional natural disasters particularly in areas in which we have facilitiesa significant portion of our transactions outside of the us is denominated in foreign currencies accordingly our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates for example in recent periods the us dollar has strengthened significantly against the euro and other major currencies which has adversely impacted our reported international revenue we expect to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the us continue to increase the level of corporate income tax from sales to our nonus customers is generally less than the level of tax from sales to our us customers this benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments systems applications and configurations which could result in errors or product failuresbecause we offer very complex products undetected errors failures or bugs may occur especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released our products are often installed and used in largescale computing environments with different operating systems system management software and equipment and networking configurations which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors failures or bugs in our products our customers computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and nonstandard configurations that make prerelease testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and timeconsuming in addition despite testing by us and others errors failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments in the past we have discovered software errors failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and in some cases have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errorserrors failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity damage to our brand product returns loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products loss of competitive position or claims by customers or others many of 15table of contentsour enduser customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other less critical software products in addition if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity security or availability occurs in one of our enduser customers systems regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating resultsif we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology our financial results could be harmedmost of our software and underlying technology is proprietary we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws however all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain use distribute and sell our proprietary information without authorizationthird parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents our shrink wrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions furthermore the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers in addition any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us which could adversely affect our operating resultsfrom time to time we are a party to lawsuits and investigations which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and which could if not determined favorably negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe have been named as a party to lawsuits including patent litigation class actions and governmental claims and we may be named in additional litigation the expense of defending such litigation may be costly and divert managements attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows in addition an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant fines settlements monetary damages or injunctive relief that could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business results of operations and cash flows third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our productsfrom time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights including claims regarding patents copyrights and trademarks because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that the number of these claims may grow in addition former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to stop selling delay shipments of or redesign our products pay monetary amounts as damages enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this riskin addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability this liability or our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating resultsadverse global economic events may impact our customers ability to do business with us thereby harming our business operating results and financial conditionadverse macroeconomic conditions could negatively affect our customers thereby impacting our business operating results or financial condition during challenging economic times and periods of high unemployment current or potential customers 16table of contentsmay delay or forgo decisions to license new products or additional instances of existing products upgrade their existing hardware or operating environments which upgrades are often a catalyst for new purchases of our software or purchase services customers may also have difficulties in obtaining the requisite thirdparty financing to complete the purchase of our products and services any of these scenarios could adversely affect our businessour exposure to credit risk and payment delinquencies on our accounts receivable significantly increases in adverse economic conditionsan adverse macroeconomic environment could subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us or delay paying us for previously purchased products and services our outstanding accounts receivables are generally not secured in addition our standard terms and conditions permit payment within a specified number of days following the receipt of our product accordingly reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase in addition weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us this would further increase our credit risk exposure and potentially cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers further while no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total net revenues in each of fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 one distributor accounted for 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of april 1 2016 the loss of this or other large customers could have a negative impact on our business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our receivables and have not suffered any material losses to date there can be no assurance such procedures will continue to effectively limit our credit risk and avoid future losseswe cannot predict our future capital needs and we may be unable to obtain financing which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditionthe onset or continuation of adverse economic conditions may make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations investing activities including potential acquisitions or financing activities any required financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our financial or operational flexibility and would also require us to fund additional interest expense if additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance our software and services through acquisitions in order to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures which could have a material adverse effect on our software and services offerings revenues results of operations and financial conditionfailure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position ability to hedge certain financial risks borrowing costs and access to capital markets our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies and such agencies have in the past and could in the future downgrade our ratings we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position ability to hedge certain financial risks and access to capital marketsour financial condition and

principal amount of 23 billion that mature at specific dates in calendar years 2017 2020 2021 and 2022 in addition we have entered into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of 10 billion from time to time in the future we may also incur indebtedness in addition to the amount available under our credit facility the maintenance of our debt levels could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of certain corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operationswe may be required to use all or a substantial portion of our cash balance to repay these notes on maturity unless we can obtain new financing there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt these risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations17table of contentsour software products saas offerings

risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and other intentional disruptions of our products and offerings we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance and availability of our products and offerings and harm our reputation as a company similarly experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our

may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products and our customers may assert claims against us related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information furthermore our employees or contractors may either intentionally or unintentionally subject us to information security risks and incidents our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidentssome of our products contain open source software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our businesscertain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled open source licenses which may include by way of example the gnu general public license gnu lesser general public license the mozilla public license the bsd license and the apache license some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our businessif we are unable to adequately address increased customer demands on our technical support services our relationships with our customers and our financial results may be adversely affectedwe offer technical support services with many of our products we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers further customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating resultswe have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers if these companies experience financial difficulties do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted which could

upon our ability to recruit and retain key management technical sales marketing finance and other personnel our officers and other key personnel are employeesatwill and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant and we face difficulties in attracting retaining and motivating employees as a result in connection with the divestiture of veritas we experienced employee attrition and related difficulties and these difficulties may continue or increase with the divestiture of veritas now complete in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of equitybased compensation as compensation expense as a result we may decide to issue fewer equitybased incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees or conversely if we fail to manag18table of contentse employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions our business and operating results could be adversely affectedeffective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution from time to time key personnel leave our company and the incidence of this increased in recent periods due to the transitions we have experienced over the last few years including the divestiture of veritas for example we recently announced that for the third time in four years we are initiating a chief executive officer transition process and appointed an interim president and chief operating officer while we strive to reduce the negative impact of changes in our leadership the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and our results of operations in addition hiring training and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming and expensive may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful which could negatively impact future financial results these risks may be exacerbated by the uncertainty associated with the transitions we have experienced over the last few yearsour contracts with the us government include compliance audit and review obligations any failure to meet these obligations could result in civil damages andor
