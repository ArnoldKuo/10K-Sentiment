functionality of our existing products and extend our product leadership in core markets we consider timetomarket synergies with existing products and potential market share gains when evaluating the economics of acquisitions of technologies product lines or companies we may acquire or dispose of other technologies products and companies in the futurewe did not make any material acquisitions during fiscal 2015competitionour markets are consolidating highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the competitive landscape has changed significantly over the past few years with new competition arising much of the market growth has come from startups whose focus is on solving a specific customer issue or delivering a specific nicheoriented product and from larger integration providers that increasingly are looking to put various types of protection whether it is backup high availability or security into their platforms we are focused on delivering comprehensive customer solutions integrating across our broad product portfolio and partnering with other technology providers to differentiate ourselves from the competition we believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry include product quality and effectiveness timetomarket price reputation financial stability breadth of product offerings customer support brand recognition and effective sales and marketing effortsin addition to the competition we face from direct competitors we face indirect or potential competition from retailers application providers operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products we also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for spending at the retail level and in corporate accounts in addition we compete with other software companies operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems to acquire technologies products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties we also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers and enterprises by oemsthe competitive environments for our security and information management products are described belowsecuritymost of the channels in which our security products are offered are highly competitive some of our consumer competitors are intensely focused on customer acquisition which has led competitors to offer their technology for free engage in aggressive marketing or enter into competitive partnerships our primary security competitors are intel corporation microsoft corporation microsoft and trend micro inc there are also several freeware providers and regional security companies 7table of contentsthat we compete against for our consumer backup offerings our primary competitors are carbonite inc and emc corporation emc in the ssl market our primary competitors are comodo group inc and godaddycom inc in the softwareasaservice saas security market our primary competitors are google inc and microsoft our primary competitors in the managed security services business are dell inc ibm corporation ibm and hewlettpackard company hpinformation managementthe markets for storage management backup archiving and ediscovery are intensely competitive our primary competitors are commvault systems inc emc hp and ibmintellectual propertyprotective measureswe regard some of the features of our internal operations software and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures contractual arrangements and other measures to protect our proprietary information our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products services and technology and enhance our competitive positionas part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees distributors and corporate partners and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information these license agreements are generally nontransferable and have either a perpetual or subscription based time limited term we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities equipment and networkstrademarks patents copyrights and licensessymantec and the symantec logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries in addition to symantec and the symantec logo we have used registered or applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions we enforce our trademark service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in usewe have more than 2700 patents in addition to foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications which relate to various aspects of our products and technology the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically 17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our productsour products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad however these measures may not provide sufficient protection and our intellectual property rights may be challenged in addition we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark license or other intellectual property rightseasonalityas is typical for many large technology companies our business is seasonal license and maintenance orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters a decline in license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to license and maintenance orders in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year in addition we generally receive a higher volume of license and maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter with orders concentrated in the latter part of that month we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met and because a significant portion of our inperiod revenue comes from our deferred revenue balanceemployeesas of april 3 2015 we employed more than 19000 people worldwide approximately 44 of whom reside in the us approximately 6100 employees work in sales and marketing 6700 in research and development 4900 in support and services and 1900 in management

description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below the list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stockif we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limitedfor the last few years we have experienced a number of transitions as we have attempted to revitalize our business model improve execution and innovate new products and services these transitions have involved significant turnover in management and other key personnel changes in our strategic direction and more recently our decision to separate into two independent publiclytraded companies transitions of the order we have experienced or are experiencing can be disruptive and result in loss of institutional focus and employee morale making execution of business strategies more difficult we are also in the process of seeking to address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc market the market shift towards tablets within mobility and architectural shifts in the provision of security and storage solutions all of which has made it more difficult for us to compete effectively and requires us to improve our product and service offerings we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with these efforts given our multiple business units the proposed separation and the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our businesswe are pursuing a plan to separate our information management business into a new independent publiclytraded company the proposed separation may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and if completed may not achieve the intended benefitsin october 2014 we announced a plan to separate into two independent publiclytraded companies through a taxfree distribution to symantec stockholders of 100 of the capital stock of our information management business the spinoff we could be delayed or prevented from completing the proposed separation or be forced to complete it on terms or conditions that are less favorable andor different than expected for a variety of reasons including unanticipated developments such as delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances uncertainty of the financial markets furthermore any significant delays or complications in our implementation of a new enterprise resource management system and it infrastructure for our standalone information management business would adversely affect our ability to effect the separation in a timely manner and could result in significant business disruption increased costs or both in addition if other opportunities were to arise for the disposition of the information business that we believe are superior to the spinoff we may elect not to complete the spinoff even if the transaction is completed we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the proposed separation moreover following the proposed separation the combined value of the common stock of the two publiclytraded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred in addition we expect to spend substantial time money and effort on completing the proposed separation without any assurance that it will be completed our investments in terms of financial and management resources may be significantly higher than expected which could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities and distract us from operating our businesses as currently conducted our focus on completing the separation and resource constraints resulting from that focus could also adversely affect the execution of our business strategy if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees lose key personnel fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully or fail to manage our employee base effectively we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products and services effectively manage or expand our business or increase our revenuesour future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management technical sales marketing finance and other personnel our officers and other key personnel are employeesatwill and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant and we face difficulties in attracting 9table of contentsretaining and motivating employees as a result these difficulties may increase during the pendency of the proposed separation and following its completion in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of equitybased compensation as compensation expense as a result we may decide to issue fewer equitybased incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees or conversely if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions our business and operating results could be adversely affectedeffective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution from time to time key personnel leave our company and the incidence of this increased in recent periods due to the transitions we have experienced over the last few years while we strive to reduce the negative impact of such changes the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and our results of operations in addition hiring training and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful which could negatively impact future revenues these risks may be exacerbated by the uncertainty associated with the transitions we have experienced over the last few years including the proposed separationfluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial resultswe are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors including general economic conditions competition product obsolescence technological change shifts in buying patterns financial difficulties and budget constraints of our current and potential customers awareness of security threats to it systems and other factors while such factors may in some periods increase product sales fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales if demand for our products and solutions declines whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in buying patterns our revenues and margins would likely be adversely affectedif we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance or if we are unable to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends our business and operating results could be adversely affectedour future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products product upgrades and services on a timely basis we have in the past incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive additionally we are in the process of addressing the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space the decline in the pc market and the market shift towards tablets and handheld devices all of which have made it more difficult for us to compete effectively customers may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have our failure to develop solutions that satisfy customer preferences in a timely and costeffective manner may harm our ability to renew our subscriptions with existing customers and to create or increase demand for our solutions and may adversely impact our operating results new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements which has frequently been longer than we originally expectedadapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customersextending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms operating systems and hardware products such as mobile devicesentering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited experiencemanaging new product and service strategies for the markets in which we operate addressing trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship our productsdeveloping or expanding efficient sales channels and10table of contentsobtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products including source code licenses for certain products with deep technical integration into operating systemsif we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges or if our new products product upgrades and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance our business and operating results could be adversely affected we may also experience increased difficulties in managing these risks and challenges during the pendency of the separation and following its completionwe operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to declinewe operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business and operating results to compete successfully we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors appropriately respond to competitive strategies and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed used and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands our competitive position and our financial results could be adversely affectedour competitors include software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to endusers of our products we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors products than our products in addition software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform in the future further product development by these vendors could cause our software applications and services to become redundant which could significantly impact our sales and financial resultswe face growing competition from network equipment computer hardware manufacturers large operating system providers and other technology companies these firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection and storage and server management software that competes at some levels with our product offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our productssecurity protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or in some cases is offered free of charge some companies offer the lowerpriced or free security products within their computer hardware or software products that we believe are inferior to our products and saas offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these security products as replacing the need for more effective full featured products and services such as those that we provide the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results by causing among other things price reductions of our products reduced profitability and loss of market sharemany of our competitors have greater financial technical sales marketing or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment such as intel corporations acquisition of mcafee could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular

accounting firm together the tax opinions substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the proposed separation and certain related internal transactions collectively the separation will qualify under sections 355 and 368 of the internal revenue code the code will be a condition to the completion of the separation in addition we will seek a private letter ruling from the irs to the effect that among other things certain aspects of the spinoff and certain other related transactions will not disqualify the spinoff or the related transactions from receiving the

income tax purposes we and those of our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities for example if the spinoff fails to qualify for taxfree treatment the transactions would for us federal income tax purposes be treated as if the stock of the information management business was sold in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our stockholders who are subject to us federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock received in the spinoff additionally the parties and their respective affiliates could incur significant us and foreign income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain related internal transactions undertaken in connection with the separation are taxablethe parties might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the separation because of restrictions relating to us federal income tax requirements for taxfree distributionsthe parties ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted after the separation in order to preserve for us federal income tax purposes the taxfree nature of the separation and certain related internal transactions even if the separation otherwise qualifies for taxfree

separation are generally presumed to be part of such a plan although the parties may be able to rebut that presumptionto preserve the taxfree treatment to us of the separation the parties will agree not to take or fail to take any action that prevents the separation and related transactions from being taxfree among other restrictions these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactionsfluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the future our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors our stock price could be negatively affected any volatility in our quarterly financial

things earthquakes floods or other natural disasters affecting our headquarters located in silicon valley california an area known for seismic activity or our other locations worldwide acts of war or terrorism intentional disruptions by third parties andhealth or similar issues such as a pandemic any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly our business models present execution and competitive risksin recent years our saas offerings have become increasingly critical in our business our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying saas offerings for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own saas strategies we cannot assure you that our investments in and development of saas offerings will achieve the expected returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the marketplace in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support saas offerings these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this business model depends on our execution in a number of areas includingcontinuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloudbased experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share andensuring that our saas offerings meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their datawe may need to change our pricing models to compete successfullythe intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact pricing in both our onpremise enterprise software business and our cloud business as well as overall demand for our onpremise software product and service offerings which could reduce our revenues and profitability our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings which could put pressure on us to further discount our product or support pricing any broadbased change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products if we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand our revenues could decrease the increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing modelsour business depends on customers renewing their arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offeringsa large portion of our revenue is derived from arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings yet existing customers have no contractual obligation to purchase additional solutions after the initial subscription or contract period our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the level of their satisfaction with our solutions or our customer support customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions compared with the solutions offered by our competitors any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly 13table of contentsthan expected if at all accordingly we must invest significant time and resources in providing ongoing value to our customers if these efforts fail or if our customers do not renew for other reasons or if they renew on terms less favorable to

that our systems are not secure against thirdparty access additionally if third parties that we work with such as vendors or developers violate applicable laws or our policies such violations may also put our customers information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business any significant change to applicable laws regulations or industry practices regarding the use or

manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers our operating results could be adversely affectedwe sell our products to customers around the world through multitiered sales and distribution networks sales through these different channels involve distinct risks including the followingdirect sales a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to endusers special risks associated with direct sales includelonger sales cycles associated with direct sales effortsdifficulty in hiring retaining and motivating our direct sales force particularly through periods of transition in our organization andsubstantial amounts of training for sales representatives to become productive in selling our products and services including regular updates to cover new and revised products and associated delays and difficulties in recognizing the expected benefits of investments in new products and updatesindirect sales channels a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels including distributors that sell our products to endusers and other resellers this channel involves a number of risks includingour lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to endusersour resellers and distributors are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customersour reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without causeour resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing products and may from time to time place greater emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing promotions and other terms offered by our competitors andthe consolidation of electronics retailers has increased their negotiating power with respect to hardware and software providers such as usoem sales channels a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into or bundle our products with their products our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks includingour lack of control over the volume of systems shipped and the timing of such shipmentsour oem partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customersour oem partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due to competitive conditions in our markets and other factorssales through our oem partners are subject to changes in general economic conditions strategic direction competitive risks and other issues that could result in a reduction of oem salesthe development work that we must generally undertake under our agreements with our oem partners may require us to invest significant resources and incur significant costs with little or no assurance of ever receiving associated revenues15table of contentsthe time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our oem partners to become familiar with our products may make it more difficult to introduce those products to the market andour oem partners may develop market and distribute their own products and market and distribute products of our competitors which could reduce our salesif we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results in addition reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future and could result in adverse operating results in future periodsover the long term we intend to invest in research and development activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating resultswhile we continue to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest significantly in research and development activities as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation in each of our business segments we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position we recognize the costs associated with these research and development investments earlier than the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affectedchanges in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairmentsin response to changes in industry and market conditions or in connection with our pending separation we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel reschedule or adjust with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earningsour inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our businesswe are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers for example we host many of our products using thirdparty data center facilities and we do not control the operation of these facilities these facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they are also subject to breakins computer viruses sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our products and servicesfurthermore our business administration human resources and finance services depend on the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations a disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster or other business continuity event could cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers in addition we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis which could adversely affect the trading value of our stock although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backedup there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient mannerany errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our products and services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers businesses for example we may experience disruptions outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors including infrastructure changes human or software errors capacity constraints due to an 16table of contentsoverwhelming number of users accessing our website simultaneous fraud or security attacks in some instances we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time interruptions in our products and services could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us in addition our business would be harmed if any of events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our services are unreliable our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose customer data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenariowe have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions which gives rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future

acquired businesses is not successful we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects to integrate acquired businesses we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positionsany of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from our acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitionsour international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our managementwe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us including engineering sales customer support and production we plan to expand our international operations but such expansion is contingent upon our identification of growth opportunities our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations includingpotential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws or that may not be adequately enforcedrequirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operationsregulations or

countriescosts and delays associated with developing software and providing support in multiple languages andpolitical unrest war or terrorism or regional natural disasters particularly in areas in which we have facilitiesa significant portion of our transactions outside of the us is denominated in foreign currencies accordingly our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates for example in recent periods the us dollar has strengthened significantly against the euro and other major currencies which has adversely impacted our reported international revenue we expect to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the us continue to increase the level of corporate income tax from sales to our nonus customers is generally less than the level of tax from sales to our us customers this benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments systems applications and configurations which could result in errors or product failuresbecause we offer very complex products undetected errors failures or bugs may occur especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released our products are often installed and used in largescale computing environments with different operating systems system management software and equipment and networking configurations which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors failures or bugs in our products our customers computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and nonstandard configurations that make prerelease testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and timeconsuming in addition despite testing by us and others errors failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments in the past we have discovered software errors failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and in some cases have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errorserrors failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity damage to our brand product returns loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products loss of competitive position or claims by customers or others many of our enduser customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other less critical software products in addition if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity security or availability occurs in one of our enduser customers systems regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating resultsif we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology our financial results could be harmedmost of our software and underlying technology is proprietary we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws however all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain use distribute and sell our proprietary information without authorizationthird parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents our shrinkwrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions furthermore the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers in addition any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us which could adversely affect

legal expenses and which could if not determined favorably negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe have been named as a party to lawsuits including patent litigation class actions and governmental claims and we may be named in additional litigation the expense of defending such litigation may be costly and divert managements attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows in addition an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant fines settlements monetary damages or injunctive relief that could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business results of operations and cash flows third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our productsfrom time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights including claims regarding patents copyrights and trademarks because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that the number of these claims may grow in addition former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to stop selling delay shipments of or redesign our products pay monetary amounts

these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability this liability or our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating resultsadverse global economic events may harm our

during challenging economic times and periods of high unemployment current or potential customers may delay or forgo decisions to license new products or additional instances of existing products upgrade their existing hardware or operating environments which upgrades are often a catalyst for new purchases of our software or purchase services customers may also have difficulties in obtaining the requisite thirdparty financing to complete the purchase of our products and services an adverse macroeconomic environment could also subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us or delay paying us for previously purchased products and services accordingly reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase in addition weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us or experience other financial difficulties this would further increase our credit risk exposure and potentially cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customersin addition the onset or continuation of adverse economic conditions may make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations investing activities including potential acquisitions or financing activities specific economic trends such as declines in

adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may be required to use all or a substantial portion of our cash balance to repay these notes on maturity unless we can obtain new

interest rates or other factors at the time of 19table of contentsrefinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would

open source licenses which may include by way of example the gnu general public license gnu lesser general public license the mozilla public license the bsd license and the apache license some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our businessif we are unable to adequately address increased customer demands on our technical support services our relationships with our customers and our financial

under our gsa schedule contract may be subject to audit or investigation by the us government noncompliance with the provisions of the contract identified as a result of such reviews as well as

lawsuit and in september 2014 the states of california and florida intervened in the lawsuit and the state of new york notified the court that it would not intervene in october 2014 the department of justice filed an amended complaint which did not state a specific damages amount and california and florida combined their claims with those of the department of justice and the relator on behalf of new york in an omnibus complaint the state claims also do not state specific damages amountsit is possible that the litigation could lead to claims or findings of violations of the false claims act and could be material to our results of operations and cash flows for any period violations of the false claims act could result in the imposition of damages including up to treble damages plus civil penalties in some cases whether or not we are successful in defending ourselves in the litigation the cost to resolve this matter would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition
