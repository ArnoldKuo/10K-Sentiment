we have a 5253week fiscal year fiscal 2014 2013 2012 2011 and 2010 each consisted of 52 weeks      b  effective march 30 2013 we changed our accounting policy for sales commissions that are incremental and directly related to customer sales contracts in which revenue is deferred the adoption of this accounting policy change has been applied retrospectively for all periods presented see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for information regarding the change in accounting policy for sales commissions      c  in fiscal 2008 we formed a joint venture with a subsidiary of huawei technologies co limited huawei in fiscal 2012 we sold our 49 ownership interest in the joint venture to huawei for 530 million in cash the gain of 530 million offset by costs to sell the joint venture of 4 million was included in gain from sale of joint venture in our fiscal 2012 consolidated statements of income      d  in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we issued 10 billion in principal amount of 100 convertible senior notes 100 notes due in june 2013 on june 15 2013 the principal balance on those notes matured and was settled by a cash payment of 1 billion along with the 5 million semiannual interest payment in addition we elected to pay the conversion value above par value of the 100 notes in cash in the amount of    29    table of contents       189 million concurrently with the payment of the conversion value we received 189 million from the note hedge we entered into at the time of the issuance of the 100 notes at the time of issuance of the 100 notes we granted warrants to affiliates of certain initial purchasers of the notes whereby they had the option to purchase up to 527 million shares of our common stock at a price of 271330 per share all the warrants expired unexercised on various dates during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 and there was no dilutive impact from the warrants on our earnings per share for fiscal 2014      e in fiscal 2011 we issued 350 million in principal amount of 275 senior notes due september 2015 275 notes due 2015 and 750 million in principal amount of 420 senior notes due september 2020 420 notes in fiscal 2013 we issued 600 million in principal amount of 275 senior notes due june 2017 275 notes due 2017 and 400 million in principal amount of 395 senior notes due june 2022 395 notes      f  see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for information regarding the correction of an error related to deferred revenue the outofperiod effect on net income of correcting this error in fiscal 2014 is 22 million and the effect on symantec corporation stockholders equity as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 was 49 million longterm deferred revenue and total stockholders equity as of fiscal 2011 and 2010 have also been adjusted however income statement data for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 have not been adjusted as the impact on net income in each of these years was not material      g  during fiscal 2014 we declared and paid common stock cash dividends dividends were recorded as a reduction to additional paidin capital no dividends or dividend equivalents were paid prior to fiscal 2014 see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for information regarding dividends and dividend equivalents      h  during fiscal 2012 we recorded an impairment of 19 million as a cumulativeeffect adjustment in accumulated deficit related to an implied fair value measurement made for our former services reporting unit upon the adoption of a new accounting standard  item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  overview  our business  symantec corporation protects the worlds information and is a global leader in security backup and availability solutions our market leading products and services protect people and information in any environment  from the smallest mobile device to the enterprise data center to cloudbased systems founded in april 1982 symantec operates one of the largest global threatintelligence networks and provides leading security backup and availability solutions the company has more than 20000 employees in more than 50 countries our internet home page is wwwsymanteccom other than the information expressly set forth in this annual report the information contained or referred to on our website is not part of this annual report  fiscal calendar  we have a 5253week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to march 31 unless otherwise stated references to years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended march 28 2014 march 29 2013 and march 30 2012 fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 each consisted of 52 weeks our 2015 fiscal year will consist of 53 weeks and will end on april 3 2015    30    table of contents strategy  the recent transformation of business and consumer technologies has driven pervasive mobility and an explosion of data resulting in the need for a new approach to protecting devices applications data and users further the emergence of the internet of things where new devices and everyday objects are becoming networked and connected to the internet for the first time highlights the need for comprehensive information security and management solutions to protect valuable data we believe that the market for security and management solutions will benefit from these trends as a platformindependent software company without bias to any individual operating system or hardware environment symantec helps customers manage more technologies with greater efficiency and on a wide range of virtual and mobile platforms  in january 2013 we announced our strategy to transition from being devicecentric or protecting endpoints and the data center to having a broader focus of protecting and managing digital information we track a vast number of threat indicators across the internet and continuously collect new telemetry from hundreds of millions of mobile devices endpoints and servers across the globe this massive amount of security data combined with our years of experience analyzing such data allows us to provide advanced intelligence and protection for all of our customers  during fiscal year 2014 we implemented changes in three areas simplifying our organizational structure redesigning our gtm strategy and changing our product offerings  simplifying our organizational structure  we aligned our organization by functional areas rather than by market segments in order to reduce complexity remove redundancies increase the speed of decision making and improve accountability and execution we reduced the number of management layers from our previous structure and increased the average span of control for managers  redesigning our gotomarket strategy  we split our direct field sales team into security and information management specialists focused on new business only and expanded their territories to be more effective for our enterprise customers we also built a renewals group in order to extend the customer relationship and make it easier to renew and do business with us we redesigned our global channel strategy focused on building partner competency rewarding performance and customer satisfaction  changing our product offerings  with a portfolio of leading products we focused our development efforts on making our point solutions better designing new integrated solutions and expanding our offerings by partnering with network security vendors to offer solutions that provide multitier protection  financial implications of new strategy  we have developed a threepronged approach to our product offering strategy which includes managing our portfolio of point solutions and reallocating resources to the offerings we estimate have the greatest growth potential expanding our total addressable market by delivering innovative new offerings that integrate our technologies to solve our customers most significant problems and focusing on developing relationships with other industry leaders that will begin the process of building ecosystems that delivers more value to our customers  we believe that sales and marketing of our innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespeople who can convey the strong value of our technology as such we restructured the    31    table of contents  sales organization into new and renewals business teams we also reorganized our direct sales force into functional areas of information security and information management the focus of these specialized teams is to generate new business through new customer acquisition or through broadening existing customer relationships we expect that by separating our direct sales force into specialized teams and focusing on new business we will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our sales process concurrently we created a dedicated renewals team that is focused on extending existing customer relationships and renewing contracts  we are also investing in our indirect sales channels to build stronger more strategic relationships that enable us to better serve consumers small business and midmarket customers through our channel partner program we are seeking to align our offerings with the optimal route to market leveraging our channel partner capabilities we also plan to align the economics and incentives under these relationships based on the value created by the partner and their commitment to symantec and our customers we believe these changes will help us provide our end customer with highquality sales and postsales support experiences while expanding our business  as part of our enhanced capital allocation strategy in fiscal 2014 we initiated a quarterly cash dividend in addition to our ongoing share repurchases activity we paid a quarterly dividend in the amount of 015 per share of common stock in each quarter of fiscal 2014 for an aggregate of 418 million or 060 per share during fiscal 2014 all shares of common stock issued and outstanding and unvested restricted stock and performancebased stock as of the record date for any dividend will be entitled to the dividend and dividend equivalents respectively any future dividends and dividend equivalents will be subject to the approval of our board of directors  our revenue income and cash flows may be impacted by severance other charges and capital expenditures as we execute our organic growth strategy  new enterprise resource planning system  during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 following our final testing and data conversion stages we implemented the critical financial reporting module of a new enterprise resource planning erp system the costs other than capital expenditures associated with this first phase of implementation of the core operating systems have been recorded in operating expenses as restructuring and transition expenses  change in management  on march 20 2014 the board of directors of the company appointed board member michael a brown as interim president and ceo following the termination of stephen m bennett as the companys president and chief executive officer mr bennett also resigned from the companys board of directors this change within our management leadership team resulted in certain severance and accelerated stock based compensation expenses  our operating segments  our current operating segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services distinguished by customer needs in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we modified our segment reporting structure to more readily match the new operating structure the three reporting segments which are the same as our operating segments are as follows user productivity amp protection information security and information management for further description of our operating segments see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report    32    table of contents financial results and trends  revenue decreased by 230 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in revenue from our user productivity amp protection segment and information management segment following the transition of our sales force into new and renewal business teams we experienced revenue declines domestically and internationally in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the asia pacific and japan region experienced the largest net revenue decrease followed by americas while the emea region experienced net revenue growth for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the asia pacific and japan region revenue declined primarily due to foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the weakening of the japanese yen compared to the us dollar while we experienced favorable foreign currency effects in the emea region  cost of revenue decreased by 26 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in revenue and decreases in intangible assets amortization as certain developed technologies became fully amortized early in fiscal 2014  operating expenses decreased by 281 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to lower salaries and wages resulting from lower headcount lower advertising and promotion expenses and lower amortization of intangible assets as various customer relationship intangibles became fully amortized early in fiscal 2014 for fiscal 2014 we recognized 270 million of restructuring and transition costs we are focused on five priorities for fiscal 2015 these include optimizing our businesses based on lifecycle and growth potential prioritizing investments for growth in our enterprise businesses further reducing costs and improving efficiencies across the company rounding out our talented executive team and continuing to return significant cash to shareholders  critical accounting estimates  the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates including judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly historically our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results however actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions if actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of income and in certain situations could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition  a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact our operating results or financial condition we believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see also note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  revenue recognition  we recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition and any applicable amendments or modifications revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make estimates    33    table of contents for software arrangements that include multiple elements including perpetual software licenses and maintenance or services packaged products with content updates and subscriptions we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on the fair value using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our standalone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance consumer product content updates managed security services subscriptions and arrangements where vsoe does not exist deferred revenue totaled approximately 39 billion as of march 28 2014 of which 581 million was classified as longterm deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time  for arrangements that include both software and nonsoftware elements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and nonsoftware deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vsoe ii thirdparty evidence of selling price tpe and iii best estimate of the selling price esp when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe we use esp to allocate the arrangement fees to the deliverables  for our consumer products that include content updates we recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sellthrough to endusers as the subscription period commences on the date of sale to the enduser we defer revenue and cost of revenue amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and resellers  we expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends we ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid purchase orders our distributors and resellers base the quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand which may exceed the expected level of a four or six week supply we offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply we estimate reserves for product returns as described below we typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels  arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance subscription or service period  reserves for product returns we reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue based primarily on historical trends we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue actual product returns may be different than what was estimated these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates  reserves for rebates we estimate and record reserves for channel and enduser rebates as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue for consumer products that include content updates rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue or deferred revenue over the term of the subscription our estimated reserves for channel    34    table of contents  volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs which are typically entered into quarterly our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs actual sales during the promotion the amount of actual redemptions received historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the value of the rebate we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates if actual redemptions differ from our estimates material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented  valuation of goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets  business combination valuations when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to           cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future           expected costs to develop the inprocess research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed           the acquired companys brand and competitive position as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio           cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset and           discount rates  these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities  goodwill impairment we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable at the reporting unit level our reporting units are the same as our operating segments a qualitative assessment is first made to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative testing this initial assessment includes among others consideration of i past current and projected future earnings and equity ii recent trends and market conditions and iii valuation metrics involving similar companies that are publiclytraded and acquisitions of similar companies if available if this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that impairment exists a second step is taken involving a comparison between the estimated fair values of our reporting units with their respective carrying amounts including goodwill the methods for estimating reporting unit values include asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and a third step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the third step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting units over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets less liabilities if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess    35    table of contents the process of estimating the fair value and carrying value of our reporting units equity requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis many assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable and property and equipment are not specifically allocated to an individual reporting unit and therefore we apply judgment to allocate the assets and liabilities and this allocation affects the carrying value of the respective reporting units similarly we use judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units based on relative fair values the use of relative fair values has been necessary for certain reporting units due to changes in our operating structure in prior years to determine a reporting units fair value we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit we evaluate the reasonableness of this approach by comparing it with the market approach which involves a review of the carrying value of our assets relative to our market capitalization and to the valuation of publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business  applying the income approach requires that we make a number of important estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of each reporting unit based on historical and forecasted revenue and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future revenue and expense growth rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit and may change from year to year changes in these key estimates and assumptions or in other assumptions used in this process could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year  as of march 28 2014 our goodwill balance was 59 billion amongst our reporting units based on a qualitative impairment analysis performed as of december 28 2013 we determined that it was more likely than not that there was no impairment in any of our reporting units  a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could affect our financial condition operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include           a prolonged global economic crisis           a significant decrease in the demand for our products           the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner           a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate           an adverse action or assessment by a regulator           successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets           a loss of key personnel           our determination to dispose of one or more of our reporting units           the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and           recognition of a goodwill impairment loss  intangible asset impairment we assess the impairment of identifiable finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset groups carrying amount may not be recoverable recoverability of certain finitelived intangible assets particularly customer relationships and finitelived trade names would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to which the    36    table of contents  assets are assigned to the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows the asset group is expected to generate if an asset is considered to be impaired the amount of such impairment would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value recoverability and impairment of other finitelived intangible assets particularly developed technology and patents would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of undiscounted estimated future product revenues offset by estimated future costs to dispose of the product to which the asset relates for indefinitelived intangible assets we review impairment on an annual basis consistent with the timing of the annual evaluation for goodwill these assets generally include trade names and trademarks similar to goodwill impairment testing a qualitative assessment is first made to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative testing this initial assessment includes consideration of among other things i past current and projected future revenues ii recent trends and market conditions including discount rates and iv valuation metrics such as royalty rates involving similar companies that are publiclytraded if available if this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that impairment exists a second step is taken this step involves a comparison between the fair values of the assets and their respective carrying amounts any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be recognized as an impairment charge our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted future revenue operating costs and other relevant factors assumptions and estimates about the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are subjective and are affected by changes to our business strategies if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimate of the fair value of our identifiable intangible assets could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition  longlived assets we assess longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the longlived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we assess recoverability of longlived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model if an asset is not recoverable impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition we record impairment charges on longlived assets held for sale when we determine that the carrying value of the longlived assets may not be recoverable in determining fair value we obtain and consider market value appraisal information from third parties  stockbased compensation  we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance stockbased compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the respective award  we issue performancebased restricted stock units prus and performancecontingent stock units pcsus representing hypothetical shares of our common stock each pru and pcsu grant reflects a target number of shares that may be issued to the award recipient the actual number of prus the recipient receives is determined at the end of a threeyear performance period as follows 1 our achievement of an annual target earnings per share for the first fiscal year of grant and 2 our two and three year cumulative relative total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies that are included in the standard amp poors 500 index the pcsus vest based upon the performance of symantecs common stock over a threeyear period and are also subject to an underlying continued service vesting condition we estimate the fair value of prus using the monte carlo simulation option pricing model monte carlo model as the total shareholder return modifier contains a market condition we estimate the fair value and derived service period of pcsus using the monte carlo model as this statistical model can simulate a range of possible future stock prices for symantec because our prus include dividendequivalent rights the fair values of prus are not discounted by the dividend yield    37    table of contents determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment we use the blackscholesmerton option pricing model bsm model to determine the fair value of stock options the determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the options actual and projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends  we estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and postvesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options the risk free interest rate is equal to the us treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life if options are granted or assumed without dividendequivalents rights the fair values are discounted by the dividend yield prior to the initial declaration of a quarterly cash dividend on may 2 2013 the fair value of options was measured based on an expected dividend yield of 0 as we did not historically pay cash dividends on our common stock for awards granted on or subsequent to june 27 2013 we used an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividends declared by our board of directors see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report  in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation we record stockbased compensation expense for awards that are expected to vest as a result judgment is required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience actual forfeitures may differ if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted when we record an adjustment for the difference in the period that the awards vest or are forfeited  contingencies and litigation  we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or legal proceedings as well as potential ranges of probable losses when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable a determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required if any for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter because of uncertainties related to these matters we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment as additional information becomes available we reassess the

results and financial position  income taxes  we are required to compute our income taxes in each federal state and international jurisdiction in which we operate this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or longterm deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets our judgments assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income    38    table of contents our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding indefinitely reinvested earnings outside the united states material changes in our estimates of such earnings or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of such earnings could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate if certain foreign earnings previously treated as indefinitely reinvested outside the united states are repatriated the related us tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings  we account for uncertain tax positions pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure those positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the refinement of estimates or the realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which such determination is made  we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance if required the determination of our valuation allowance involves assumptions judgments and estimates including forecasted earnings future taxable income and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income  results

shortterm investments of 32 million during fiscal 2014 coupled with a decrease in interest expense of 55 million as we experienced lower amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts following the maturity of our 10 billion 100 notes in june 2013  fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012  in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we issued 600 million in principal amount of 275 interestbearing senior notes due june 2017 and 400 million in principal amount of 395 interestbearing senior notes due june 2022 which resulted in interest expense of 26 million in fiscal 2013 other income expense net increased due to a tax incentive received from the china tax bureau in the form of valueadded tax refunds of 33 million  provision for income taxes                                        fiscal

tax expense in fiscal 2014 was reduced by the following benefits 1 33 million for the resolution of a tax matter related to the sale of our 49 ownership interest in the joint venture with huawei during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 2 24 million for tax benefits related to the settlement of the symantec 2005 through 2008 internal revenue service irs audit 3 15 million tax benefit related to certain foreign operations and 4 13 million from lapses of statutes of limitation these tax benefits were partially offset by 12 million in tax expense resulting from the sale of shortterm investments    44    table of contents the tax expense in fiscal 2013 was reduced by the following benefits 1 17 million tax benefits arising from the veritas 2002 through 2005 irs appeals matters including adjustments to state liabilities and a reduction of interest accrued 2 13 million in tax benefits resulting from tax settlements and adjustments to prior year items 3 10 million from lapses of statutes of limitation and 4 2 million for the benefit of the research credit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 resulting from the extension of the federal research credit as part of the 2012 taxpayer relief act these tax benefits were offset by a 9 million tax expense from an increase in valuation allowance on state research tax credits  the tax expense in fiscal 2012 was reduced by the following benefits 1 52 million tax benefit arising from the veritas 2002 through 2005 irs appeals matters 2 14 million from lapses of statutes of limitation 3 17 million from the settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities and related remeasurements and 4 5 million tax benefit from adjustments related to prior year items this benefit was partially offset by a 5 million tax expense resulting from a change in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets  the effective tax rates for all periods presented otherwise reflect the benefits of lowertaxed international earnings and losses from our joint venture with huawei technologies co limited domestic manufacturing incentives and research and development credits the us federal research and development credit expired on december 31 2013 partially offset by state income taxes pretax income from international operations was significantly higher in fiscal 2012 due to the sale of our 49 ownership interest in the joint venture to huawei on march 30 2012 for 526 million a significant portion of the sale proceeds was attributable to international tax jurisdictions resulting in a 20 tax rate on the sale of the joint venture reducing the overall tax rate in fiscal 2012 by 3  we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and international tax jurisdictions a substantial portion of our international earnings were generated from subsidiaries organized in ireland and singapore our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict  for further information on the impact of foreign earnings on our effective tax rate see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  see critical accounting estimates above for additional information about our provision for income taxes  in assessing the ability to realize our deferred tax assets we considered whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we considered the following we have historical cumulative book income as measured by the current and prior two years we have strong consistent taxpaying history we have substantial us federal income tax carryback potential and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in part i item 1a risk factors set forth in this annual report we have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and thus that the deferred tax assets as of march 28 2014 of 347 million after application of the valuation allowances described above are realizable on a more likely than not basis  on december 2 2009 we received a revenue agents report from the irs for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years assessing additional taxes due we contested 80 million of the tax assessed and all penalties as a result of negotiations with irs appeals in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we remeasured our liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting in a tax benefit of 52 million we executed the final closing agreement for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years on december 26 2012 accordingly we recorded a further tax benefit of 3 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 based on the closing agreement further we amended our state tax returns for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 to reflect the adjustments in the closing agreement and remeasured our state liability resulting in a benefit of 7 million    45    table of contents the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year although potential resolution of uncertain tax positions involve multiple tax periods and jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both in the next 12 months by between 20 million and 140 million  we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing tax controversies and the impact if any of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions  noncontrolling interest  in fiscal 2011 we completed the acquisition of the identity and authentication business of verisign including a controlling interest in its subsidiary verisign japan kk verisign japan a publicly traded company on the

and the approximate timing of the transaction the table above also includes agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment the amounts under

partners subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us in addition our bylaws contain indemnification obligations to our directors officers employees and agents and we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers to give such directors and officers additional contractual assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in our bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers it is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements might not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our consolidated financial statements  we provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party historically payments made under these provisions have been immaterial we monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred  recently issued authoritative guidance
