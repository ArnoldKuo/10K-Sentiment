trends as a platformindependent software company without bias to any individual operating system or hardware environment symantec helps customers manage more technologies with greater efficiency and on a wide range of virtual and mobile platforms  in january 2013 we announced our strategy to transition from being devicecentric or protecting endpoints and the data center to having a broader focus

endpoints and servers across the globe this massive amount of security data combined with our years of experience analyzing such data allows us to provide advanced intelligence and protection for all of our customers  during fiscal year 2014 we implemented changes in three areas simplifying our organizational structure redesigning our gotomarket gtm strategy and changing our product offerings  simplifying our organizational structure  we aligned our organization by functional areas rather than by market segments in order to reduce complexity remove redundancies increase the speed of decision making and improve accountability and execution we reduced the number of management layers from our previous structure and increased the average span of control for managers  redesigning our

net revenue  acquisitions  our strategy will be complemented by business combinations that fit strategically and meet specific profitability hurdles our acquisitions are designed to enhance the features and functionality of our existing products and extend our product leadership in core markets we consider timetomarket synergies with existing products and potential market share gains when evaluating the economics of acquisitions of technologies product lines or companies we may acquire or dispose of other technologies products and companies in the future    8    table of contents we did not make any material acquisitions during fiscal 2014  competition  our markets are consolidating highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the competitive landscape has changed significantly over the past few years with new competition arising much of the market growth has come from startups whose focus is on solving a specific customer issue or delivering a specific nicheoriented product and from larger integration providers that increasingly are looking to put various types of protection whether it is backup high availability or security into their platforms we are focused on delivering comprehensive customer solutions integrating across our broad product portfolio and partnering with other technology providers to differentiate ourselves from the competition we believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry include product quality and effectiveness timetomarket price reputation financial stability breadth of product offerings customer support brand recognition and effective sales and marketing efforts  in addition to the competition we face from direct competitors we face indirect or potential competition from retailers application providers operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products we also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for spending at the retail level and in corporate accounts in addition we compete with other software companies operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems to acquire technologies products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties we also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers and enterprises by oems  the competitive environments for our security and management products are described below  security  most of the channels in which our security products are offered are highly competitive some of our consumer competitors are intensely focused on customer acquisition which has led competitors to offer their technology for free engage in aggressive marketing or enter into competitive partnerships our primary security competitors are mcafee inc owned by intel corporation microsoft corporation microsoft and trend micro inc there are also several freeware providers and regional security companies that we compete against for our consumer backup offerings our primary competitors are carbonite inc and mozy inc owned by emc corporation emc in the authentication services market our primary competitors are comodo group inc rsa the security division of emc entrust inc and godaddycom inc in the softwareasaservice saas security market our primary competitors are google incs postini services and microsoft our primary competitors in the managed services business are secureworks inc owned by dell inc and verizon communications inc  information management  the markets for storage management backup archiving and ediscovery are intensely competitive our primary competitors are commvault systems inc emc hewlettpackard company ibm oracle and veeam software  intellectual property  protective measures  we regard some of the features of our internal operations software and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures contractual arrangements and other measures to protect our proprietary information our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products services and technology and enhance our competitive position    9    table of contents as part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees distributors and corporate partners and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information these license agreements are generally nontransferable and have either a perpetual or subscription based time limited term we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities equipment and networks  trademarks patents copyrights and licenses  symantec and the symantec logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries in addition to symantec and the symantec logo we have used registered or applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions we enforce our trademark service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use  we have more than 2200 patents in addition to foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications which relate to various aspects of our products and technology the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically 17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products  our products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad however these measures may not provide sufficient protection and our intellectual property rights may be challenged in addition we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark license or other intellectual property right  seasonality  as is typical for many large software companies our business is seasonal software license and maintenance orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters a decline in license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to license and maintenance orders in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year in addition we generally receive a higher volume of software license and maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter with orders concentrated in the latter part of that month we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met and because a significant portion of our inperiod revenue comes from our deferred revenue balance  employees  as of march 28 2014 we employed more than 20800 people worldwide approximately 44 of whom reside in the us approximately 6600 employees work in sales and marketing 7000 in research and development 5400 in support and services and 1800 in management manufacturing and administration    10    table of contents available information  our internet address is wwwsymanteccom we make available free of charge our annual reports on form 10k quarterly

a website that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding our filings at httpwwwsecgov  item 1a risk factors  a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below the list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock  if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited  in january 2013 under the direction of our thennew chief executive officer we commenced a plan to revitalize our business model with a focus on operations sales and organizational structure with the goal of improving our existing products and services at the same time we laid out a roadmap to develop new innovative products and services that solve important unmet or underserved needs one set of challenges relates to leadership under our new business model as in recent periods we have experienced transitions of several senior officers including our chief executive officer while our board of directors remains committed to our strategic direction management transitions can be disruptive and result in loss of institutional focus and employee morale making execution of business strategies more difficult we are also in the process of seeking to address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc market the market shift towards tablets within mobility and architectural shifts in the provision of security and storage solutions all of which has made it more difficult for us to compete effectively and requires us to improve our product and service offerings a third set of challenges relates to gtm execution as we have significantly reorganized our sales structure and have only recently announced our new product strategy we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with these efforts given our multiple business units and the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business  if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees lose key personnel fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully or fail to manage our employee base effectively we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products and services effectively manage or expand our business or increase our revenues  our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management technical sales marketing finance and other personnel our officers and other key personnel are employeesatwill and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of equitybased compensation as compensation expense as a result we may decide to issue fewer equitybased incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees or conversely if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions our business and operating results could be adversely affected    11    table of contents effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution from time to time key personnel leave our company and the incidence of this increased in recent periods following the transition within the office of the chief executive officer ceo in 2013 in addition we could experience similar departures following our recent chief executive officer transition while we strive to reduce the negative impact of such changes the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and the results of our operations in addition hiring training and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful which could negatively impact future revenues these risks may be exacerbated by the uncertainty associated with the successive transitions in the office of the chief executive officer  fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results  we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors including general economic conditions competition product obsolescence technological change shifts in buying patterns financial difficulties and budget constraints of our current and potential customers levels of broadband usage awareness of security threats to it systems and other factors while such factors may in some periods increase product sales fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales if demand for our products and solutions declines whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in buying patterns our revenues and margins would likely be adversely affected  if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance or if we are unable to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends our business and operating results could be adversely affected  our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products product upgrades and services on a timely basis we have in the past incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including           managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements which has frequently been longer than we originally expected         adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers         extending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms operating systems and hardware products such as mobile devices         entering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited experience         managing new product and service strategies including integrating our various security and storage technologies management solutions customer service and support into unified enterprise security and storage solutions         addressing trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship our products         developing or expanding efficient sales channels         obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products including source code licenses for certain products with deep technical integration into operating systems    12    table of contents if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges or if our new products product upgrades and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance our business and operating results could be adversely affected  we operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline  we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business and operating results to compete successfully we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors appropriately respond to competitive strategies and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed used and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands our competitive position and our financial results could be adversely affected  our competitors include software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to endusers of our products we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors products than our products in addition software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform in the future further product development by these vendors could cause our software applications and services to become redundant which could significantly impact our sales and financial results  we face growing competition from network equipment computer hardware manufacturers large operating system providers and other technology companies these firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection and storage and server management software that competes at some levels with our product offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our products  security protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or in some cases is offered free of charge some companies offer the lowerpriced or free security products within their computer hardware or software products that we believe are inferior to our products and saas offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these security products as replacing the need for more effective full featured products and services such as those that we provide the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results by causing among other things price reductions of our products reduced profitability and loss of market share  many of our competitors have greater financial technical sales marketing or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment such as intel corporations acquisition of mcafee could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete    13    table of contents our business models present execution and competitive risks  in recent years our saas offerings have become increasingly critical in our business our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying saas offerings for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own saas strategies we cannot assure you that our investments in and development of saas offerings will achieve the expected returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the marketplace in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support saas offerings these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including           continuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloudbased experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share and         ensuring that our saas offerings meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data  our business depends on customers renewing their arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings  a large portion of our revenue is derived from arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings yet existing customers have no contractual obligation to purchase additional solutions after the initial subscription or contract period and given our limited operating history we are unable to accurately predict our customer renewal rates our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the level of their satisfaction with our solutions or our customer support customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions compared with the solutions offered by our competitors any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected if at all accordingly we must invest significant time and resources in providing ongoing value to our customers if these efforts fail or if our customers do not renew for other reasons or if they renew on terms less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business will suffer  our increasing focus on the delivery of products in an appliance form factor creates new business and financial risks  since fiscal 2012 shipments of products to customers in an appliance form factor have represented an increasingly larger part of our revenues and we expect this trend to continue the delivery of solutions in the form of appliances creates business and financial risks including the following           increased cost of components and contract manufacturing as we do not own our manufacturing facilities         supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers         a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increases our costs andor causes a delay in order fulfillment         excess inventory levels which could lead to writedowns or obsolescence charges         additional reserves for product returns         challenges in managing our channel business         tax and trade compliance complications and         local field support of customers appliances    14    table of contents defects disruptions or risks related to the provision of our saas offerings could impair our ability to deliver our services and could expose us to liability damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business  our saas offerings may contain errors or defects that users identify after they begin using them that could result in unanticipated service interruptions which could harm our reputation and our business since our customers use our saas offerings for missioncritical protection from threats to electronic information endpoint devices and computer networks any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our saas offerings could significantly harm our reputation and may damage our customers businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation  we currently serve our saasbased customers from hosting facilities located across the globe damage to or failure of any significant element of these hosting facilities could result in interruptions in our service which could harm our customers and expose us to liability interruptions or failures in our service delivery could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us could adversely affect our renewal rates and could harm our ability to attract new customers our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that our saas offerings are unreliable  our saas offerings also involve the storage and transmission of large amounts of our customers proprietary information including sensitive and personally identifiable information breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against such breaches our security measures could be breached at any time and could result in unauthorized third parties obtaining access to our or our customers data any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our saas offerings could reduce sales and constrain consumer and business customer adoption of our saas offering in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further security measures could be significant  if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers our operating results could be adversely affected  we sell our products to customers around the world through multitiered sales and distribution networks sales through these different channels involve distinct risks including the following  direct sales a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to endusers special risks associated with direct sales include           longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts         difficulty in hiring retaining and motivating our direct sales force particularly through periods of transition in our organization         substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to become productive in selling our products and services including regular updates to cover new and revised products and associated delays and difficulties in recognizing the expected benefits of investments in new products and updates    15    table of contents indirect sales channels a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels including distributors that sell our products to endusers and other resellers this channel involves a number of risks including           our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to endusers         our resellers and distributors are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers         our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause         our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing products and may from time to time place greater emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing promotions and other terms offered by our competitors         the consolidation of electronics retailers has increased their negotiating power with respect to hardware and software providers such as us  oem sales channels a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into or bundle our products with their products our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks including           our lack of control over the volume of systems shipped and the timing of such shipments         our oem partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers         our oem partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due to competitive conditions in our markets and other factors         sales through our oem partners are subject to changes in general economic conditions strategic direction competitive risks and other issues that could result in a reduction of oem sales         the development work that we must generally undertake under our agreements with our oem partners may require us to invest significant resources and incur significant costs with little or no assurance of ever receiving associated revenues         the time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our oem partners to become familiar with our products may make it more difficult to introduce those products to the market         our oem partners may develop market and distribute their own products and market and distribute products of our competitors which could reduce our sales  if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results in addition reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future and could result in adverse operating results in future periods  over the long term we intend to invest in research and development activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results  while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in research and development activities as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected    16    table of contents changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments  in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel reschedule or adjust with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings  our inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our business  we are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers for example we host many of our products using thirdparty data center facilities and we do not control the operation of these facilities these facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they are also subject to breakins computer viruses sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our products and services  furthermore our business administration human resources and finance services depend on the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations a disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster or other business continuity event could cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers in addition we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis which could affect the trading value of our stock although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backedup there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient manner  any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our products and services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers businesses for example we may experience disruptions outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors including infrastructure changes human or software errors capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our website simultaneous fraud or security attacks in some instances we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time interruptions in our products and services could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us in addition our business would be harmed if any of events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our services are unreliable our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose customer data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario    17    table of contents we are currently planning and designing information systems enhancements and problems with the design or implementation of these enhancements could interfere with our business and operations  we are currently in the process of significantly enhancing our information systems including planning and designing a new enterprise resource planning system the implementation of significant enhancements to information systems is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise which may especially be the case for us due to the size and complexity of our businesses any disruptions relating to our systems enhancements particularly any disruptions impacting our operations during the design or implementation periods could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide services and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business even if we do not encounter these adverse effects the planning designing and implementation may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully plan design or implement the information systems enhancements as planned our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted  we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions which gives rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results  we have in the past acquired and we expect to acquire in the future other businesses business units and technologies acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and challenges including           complexity time and costs associated with the integration of acquired business operations workforce products and technologies         diversion of management time and attention         loss or termination of employees including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employees         assumption of liabilities of the acquired business including litigation related to the acquired business         the addition of acquisitionrelated debt as well as increased expenses and working capital requirements         dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders         substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses writeoff of inprocess research and development impairment of goodwill amortization of intangible assets and stockbased compensation expense  if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects to integrate acquired businesses we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from our acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions  our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our management  we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us including engineering sales customer support and production we plan to expand our international operations but such expansion is contingent upon our identification of growth opportunities our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations including           potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws or that may not be adequately enforced    18    table of contents        requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operations         regulations or restrictions on the use import or export of encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications         local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations         central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the us         fluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and inflationary conditions could reduce our customers ability to obtain financing for software products or that could make our products more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries         limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations         longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable         difficulties in staffing managing and operating our international operations including difficulties related to administering our stock plans in some foreign countries         difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations         seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in europe and in other periods in other countries         costs and delays associated with developing software and providing support in multiple languages         political unrest war or terrorism or regional natural disasters particularly in areas in which we have facilities  a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us are denominated in foreign currencies accordingly our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates we expect to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the united states continue to increase  the level of corporate tax from sales to our nonus customers is generally less than the level of tax from sales to our us customers this benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits  our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments systems applications and configurations which could result in errors or product failures  because we offer very complex products undetected errors failures or bugs may occur especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released our products are often installed and used in largescale computing environments with different operating systems system management software and equipment and networking configurations which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors failures or bugs in our products our customers computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and nonstandard configurations that make prerelease testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and timeconsuming in addition despite testing by us and others errors failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments in the past we have discovered software errors failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and in some cases have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors  errors failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity damage to our brand product returns loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products loss of competitive position or claims by    19    table of contents  customers or others many of our enduser customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other less critical software products in addition if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our enduser customers systems regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results  if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology our financial results could be harmed  most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws however all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain use distribute and sell our proprietary information without authorization  third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents our shrinkwrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions furthermore the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers in addition any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in alone or through our alliances with the business software alliance bsa or the software amp information industry association siia could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us which could adversely affect our operating results  from time to time we are a party to class action and other lawsuits and investigations which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and which could if not determined favorably negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  we have been named as a party to class action lawsuits and we may be named in additional litigation for example during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we were advised by the commercial litigation branch of the department of justices civil division and the civil division of the us attorneys office for the district of columbia that the government is investigating our compliance with certain provisions of our us general services administration multiple award schedule contract no gs35f0240t effective january 24 2007 including provisions relating to pricing country of origin accessibility and the disclosure of commercial sales practices the expense of defending such litigation may be costly and divert managements attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows in addition an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant fines settlements monetary damages or injunctive relief that could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business results of operations and cash flows  third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products  from time to time we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others including claims regarding patents copyrights and trademarks because of constant technological change in the segments    20    table of contents  in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that the number of these claims may grow in addition former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to stop selling delay shipments of or redesign our products pay monetary amounts as damages enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk  in addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability this liability or our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results  fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the future  our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors our stock price could be negatively affected any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance  factors associated with our industry the operation of our business and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate including           reduced demand for any of our products         customer renewal rates         entry of new competition into our markets         competitive pricing pressure for one or more of our classes of products         our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced versions of our products         how well we execute our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business model that could result in significant restructuring charges         fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates         the number severity and timing of threat outbreaks eg worms and viruses         our resellers making a substantial portion of their purchases near the end of each quarter         enterprise customers tendency to negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter         cancellation deferral or limitation of orders by customers         changes in the mix or type of products sold         movements in interest rates         the rate of adoption of new product technologies and new releases of operating systems         weakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry conditions in any of the multiple markets in which we operate that could reduce customer demand and ability to pay for our products and services         political and military instability which could slow spending within our target markets delay sales cycles and otherwise adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and operate effectively         budgetary constraints of customers which are influenced by corporate earnings and government budget cycles and spending objectives    21    table of contents        disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused by among other things earthquakes floods or other natural disasters affecting our headquarters located in silicon valley california an area known for seismic activity or our other locations worldwide         acts of war or terrorism         intentional disruptions by third parties         health or similar issues such as a pandemic  any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly  adverse global economic events may harm our business operating results and financial condition  adverse macroeconomic conditions could negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition under a number of different scenarios during challenging economic times and periods of high unemployment current or potential customers may delay or forgo decisions to license new products or additional instances of existing products upgrade their existing hardware or operating environments which upgrades are often a catalyst for new purchases of our software or purchase services customers may also have difficulties in obtaining the requisite thirdparty financing to complete the purchase of our products and services an adverse macroeconomic environment could also subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us or delay paying us for previously purchased products and services accordingly reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase in addition weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us or experience other financial difficulties this would further increase our credit risk exposure and potentially cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers  in addition the onset or continuation of adverse economic conditions may make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations investing activities including potential acquisitions or financing activities specific economic trends such as declines in the demand for pcs servers and other computing devices or softness in corporate information technology spending could have an even more direct and harmful impact on our business  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities  as a result of the sale of our 275 senior notes 275 notes due 2015 and 420 senior notes 420 notes in september 2010 and 275 senior

2020 and 2022 in addition we have entered into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of 1 billion from time to time in the future we may also incur indebtedness in addition to the amount available under our credit facility the maintenance of our debt levels could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of certain corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may be required to use all or a substantial portion of our cash balance to repay these notes on maturity unless we can obtain new financing  our software products saas offerings and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales  despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and other intentional disruptions of our products and offerings we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products and offerings and harm our reputation as a company similarly experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our website and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks    22    table of contents  change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products and our customers may assert claims against us related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims  some of our products contain open source software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business  certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled open source licenses which may include by way of example the gnu general public license gnu lesser general public license the mozilla public license the bsd license and the apache license some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business  if we are unable to adequately address increased customer demands on our technical support services our relationships with our customers and our financial results may be adversely affected  we offer technical support services with many of our products we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers further customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results  we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers if these companies experience financial difficulties do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or otherwise fail to

of business and consumer technologies has driven pervasive mobility and an explosion of data resulting in the need for a new approach to protecting devices applications data and users further the emergence of the internet of things where new devices and everyday objects are becoming networked and connected to the internet for the first time highlights the need for comprehensive information security and management solutions to protect valuable data we believe that the market for security and management solutions will benefit from these trends as a platformindependent software company without bias to any individual operating system or hardware environment symantec helps customers manage more technologies with greater efficiency and on a wide range of virtual and mobile platforms  in january 2013 we announced our strategy to transition from being devicecentric or protecting endpoints and the data center to having a broader focus of protecting and managing digital information we track a vast number of threat indicators across the internet and continuously collect new telemetry from hundreds of millions of mobile devices endpoints and servers across the globe this massive amount of security data combined with our years of experience analyzing such data allows us to provide advanced intelligence and protection for all of our customers  during fiscal year 2014 we implemented changes in three areas simplifying our organizational structure redesigning our gtm strategy and changing our product offerings  simplifying our organizational structure  we aligned our organization by functional areas rather than by market segments in order to reduce complexity remove redundancies increase the speed of decision making and improve accountability and execution we reduced the number of management layers from our previous structure and increased the average span of control for managers  redesigning our gotomarket strategy  we split our direct field sales team into security and information management specialists focused on new business only and expanded their territories to be more effective for our enterprise customers we also built a renewals group in order to extend the customer relationship and make it easier to renew and do business with us we redesigned our global channel strategy focused on building partner competency rewarding performance and customer satisfaction  changing our product offerings  with a portfolio of leading products we focused our development efforts on making our point solutions better designing new integrated solutions and expanding our offerings by partnering with network security vendors to offer solutions that provide multitier protection  financial implications of new strategy  we have developed a threepronged approach to our product offering strategy which includes managing our portfolio of point solutions and reallocating resources to the offerings we estimate have the greatest growth potential expanding our total addressable market by delivering innovative new offerings that integrate our technologies to solve our customers most significant problems and focusing on developing relationships with other industry leaders that will begin the process of building ecosystems that delivers more value to our customers  we believe that sales and marketing of our innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespeople who can convey the strong value of our technology as such we restructured the    31    table of contents  sales organization into new and renewals business teams we also reorganized our direct sales force into functional areas of information security and information management the focus of these specialized teams is to generate new business through new customer acquisition or through broadening existing customer relationships we expect that by separating our direct sales force into specialized teams and focusing on new business we will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our sales process concurrently we created a dedicated renewals team that is focused on extending existing customer relationships and renewing contracts  we are also investing in our indirect sales channels to build stronger more strategic relationships that enable us to better serve consumers small business and midmarket customers through our channel partner program we are seeking to align our offerings with the optimal route to market leveraging our channel partner capabilities we also plan to align the economics and incentives under these relationships based on the value created by the partner and their commitment to symantec and our customers we believe these changes will help us provide our end customer with highquality sales and postsales support experiences while expanding our business  as part of our enhanced capital allocation strategy in fiscal 2014 we initiated a quarterly cash dividend in addition to our ongoing share repurchases activity we paid a quarterly dividend in the amount of 015 per share of common stock in each quarter of fiscal 2014 for an aggregate of 418 million or 060 per share during fiscal 2014 all shares of common stock issued and outstanding and unvested restricted stock and performancebased stock as of the record date for any dividend will be entitled to the dividend and dividend equivalents respectively any future dividends and dividend equivalents will be subject to the approval of our board of directors  our revenue income and cash flows may be impacted by severance other charges and capital expenditures as we execute our organic growth strategy  new enterprise resource planning system  during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 following our final testing and data conversion stages we implemented the critical financial reporting module of a new enterprise resource planning erp system the costs other than capital expenditures associated with this first phase of implementation of the core operating systems have been recorded in operating expenses as restructuring and transition expenses  change in management  on march 20 2014 the board of directors of the company appointed board member michael a brown as interim president and ceo following the termination of stephen m bennett as the companys president and chief executive officer mr bennett also resigned from the companys board of directors this change within our management leadership team resulted in certain severance and accelerated stock based compensation expenses  our operating segments  our current operating segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services distinguished by customer needs in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we modified our segment reporting structure to more readily match the new operating structure the three reporting segments which are the same as our operating segments are as follows user productivity amp protection information security and information management for further description of our operating segments see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report    32    table of contents financial results and trends  revenue decreased by 230 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in revenue from our user productivity amp protection segment and information management segment following the transition of our sales force into new and renewal business teams we experienced revenue declines domestically and internationally in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the asia pacific and japan region experienced the largest net revenue decrease followed by americas while the emea region experienced net revenue growth for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the asia pacific and japan region revenue declined primarily due to foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the weakening of the japanese yen compared to the us dollar while we experienced favorable foreign currency effects in the emea region  cost of revenue decreased by 26 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in revenue and decreases in intangible assets amortization as certain developed technologies became fully amortized early in fiscal 2014  operating expenses decreased by 281 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to lower salaries and wages resulting from lower headcount lower advertising and promotion expenses and lower amortization of intangible assets as various customer relationship intangibles became fully amortized early in fiscal 2014 for fiscal 2014 we recognized 270 million of restructuring and transition costs we are focused on five priorities for fiscal 2015 these include optimizing our businesses based on lifecycle and growth potential prioritizing investments for growth in our enterprise businesses further reducing costs and improving efficiencies across the company rounding out our talented executive team and continuing to return significant cash to shareholders  critical accounting estimates  the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates including judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly historically our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results however actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions if actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of income and in certain situations could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition  a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact our operating results or financial condition we believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see also note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  revenue recognition  we recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition and any applicable amendments or modifications revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make estimates    33    table of contents for software arrangements that include multiple elements including perpetual software licenses and maintenance or services packaged products with content updates and subscriptions we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on the fair value using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our standalone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance consumer product content updates managed security services subscriptions and arrangements where vsoe does not exist deferred revenue totaled approximately 39 billion as of march 28 2014 of which 581 million was classified as longterm deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time  for arrangements that include both software and nonsoftware elements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and nonsoftware deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vsoe ii thirdparty evidence of selling price tpe and iii best estimate of the selling price esp when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe we use esp to allocate the arrangement fees to the deliverables  for our consumer products that include content updates we recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sellthrough to endusers as the subscription period commences on the date of sale to the enduser we defer revenue and cost of revenue amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and resellers  we expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends we ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid purchase orders our distributors and resellers base the quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand which may exceed the expected level of a four or six week supply we offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply we estimate reserves for product returns as described below we typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels  arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance subscription or service period  reserves for product returns we reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue based primarily on historical trends we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue actual product returns may be different than what was estimated these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates  reserves for rebates we estimate and record reserves for channel and enduser rebates as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue for consumer products that include content updates rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue or deferred revenue over the term of the subscription our estimated reserves for channel    34    table of contents  volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs which are typically entered into quarterly our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs actual sales during the promotion the amount of actual redemptions received historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the value of the rebate we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates if actual redemptions differ from our estimates material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented  valuation of goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets  business combination valuations when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to           cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future           expected costs to develop the inprocess research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed           the acquired companys brand and competitive position as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio           cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset and           discount rates  these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities  goodwill impairment we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable at the reporting unit level our reporting units are the same as our operating segments a qualitative assessment is first made to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative testing this initial assessment includes among others consideration of i past current and projected future earnings and equity ii recent trends and market conditions and iii valuation metrics involving similar companies that are publiclytraded and acquisitions of similar companies if available if this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that impairment exists a second step is taken involving a comparison between the estimated fair values of our reporting units with their respective carrying amounts including goodwill the methods for estimating reporting unit values include asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and a third step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the third step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting units over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets less liabilities if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess    35    table of contents the process of estimating the fair value and carrying value of our reporting units equity requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis many assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable and property and equipment are not specifically allocated to an individual reporting unit and therefore we apply judgment to allocate the assets and liabilities and this allocation affects the carrying value of the respective reporting units similarly we use judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units based on relative fair values the use of relative fair values has been necessary for certain reporting units due to changes in our operating structure in prior years to determine a reporting units fair value we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit we evaluate the reasonableness of this approach by comparing it with the market approach which involves a review of the carrying value of our assets relative to our market capitalization and to the valuation of publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business  applying the income approach requires that we make a number of important estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of each reporting unit based on historical and forecasted revenue and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future revenue and expense growth rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit and may change from year to year changes in these key estimates and assumptions or in other assumptions used in this process could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year  as of march 28 2014 our goodwill balance was 59 billion amongst our reporting units based on a qualitative impairment analysis performed as of december 28 2013 we determined that it was more likely than not that there was no impairment in any of our reporting units  a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could affect our financial condition operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include           a prolonged global economic crisis           a significant decrease in the demand for our products           the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner           a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate           an adverse action or assessment by a regulator           successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets           a loss of key personnel           our determination to dispose of one or more of our reporting units           the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and           recognition of a goodwill impairment loss  intangible asset impairment we assess the impairment of identifiable finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset groups carrying amount may not be recoverable recoverability of certain finitelived intangible assets particularly customer relationships and finitelived trade names would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to which the    36    table of contents  assets are assigned to the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows the asset group is expected to generate if an asset is considered to be impaired the amount of such impairment would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value recoverability and impairment of other finitelived intangible assets particularly developed technology and patents would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of undiscounted estimated future product revenues offset by estimated future costs to dispose of the product to which the asset relates for indefinitelived intangible assets we review impairment on an annual basis consistent with the timing of the annual evaluation for goodwill these assets generally include trade names and trademarks similar to goodwill impairment testing a qualitative assessment is first made to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative testing this initial assessment includes consideration of among other things i past current and projected future revenues ii recent trends and market conditions including discount rates and iv valuation metrics such as royalty rates involving similar companies that are publiclytraded if available if this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that impairment exists a second step is taken this step involves a comparison between the fair values of the assets and their respective carrying amounts any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be recognized as an impairment charge our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted future revenue operating costs and other relevant factors assumptions and estimates about the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are subjective and are affected by changes to our business strategies if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimate of the fair value of our identifiable intangible assets could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition  longlived assets we assess longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the longlived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we assess recoverability of longlived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model if an asset is not recoverable impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition we record impairment charges on longlived assets held for sale when we determine that the carrying value of the longlived assets may not be recoverable in determining fair value we obtain and consider market value appraisal information from third parties  stockbased compensation  we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance stockbased compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the respective award  we issue performancebased restricted stock units prus and performancecontingent stock units pcsus representing hypothetical shares of our common stock each pru and pcsu grant reflects a target number of shares that may be issued to the award recipient the actual number of prus the recipient receives is determined at the end of a threeyear performance period as follows 1 our achievement of an annual target earnings per share for the first fiscal year of grant and 2 our two and three year cumulative relative total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies that are included in the standard amp poors 500 index the pcsus vest based upon the performance of symantecs common stock over a threeyear period and are also subject to an underlying continued service vesting condition we estimate the fair value of prus using the monte carlo simulation option pricing model monte carlo model as the total shareholder return modifier contains a market condition we estimate the fair value and derived service period of pcsus using the monte carlo model as this statistical model can simulate a range of possible future stock prices for symantec because our prus include dividendequivalent rights the fair values of prus are not discounted by the dividend yield    37    table of contents determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment we use the blackscholesmerton option pricing model bsm model to determine the fair value of stock options the determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the options actual and projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends  we estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and postvesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options the risk free interest rate is equal to the us treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life if options are granted or assumed without dividendequivalents rights the fair values are discounted by the dividend yield prior to the initial declaration of a quarterly cash dividend on may 2 2013 the fair value of options was measured based on an expected dividend yield of 0 as we did not historically pay cash dividends on our common stock for awards granted on or subsequent to june 27 2013 we used an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividends declared by our board of directors see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report  in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation we record stockbased compensation expense for awards that are expected to vest as a result judgment is required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience actual forfeitures may differ if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted when we record an adjustment for the difference in the period that the awards vest or are forfeited  contingencies and litigation  we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or legal proceedings as well as potential ranges of probable losses when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable a determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required if any for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter because of uncertainties related to these matters we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position  income taxes  we are required to compute our income taxes in each federal state and international jurisdiction in which we operate this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or longterm deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets our judgments assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income    38    table of contents our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding indefinitely reinvested earnings outside the united states material changes in our estimates of such earnings or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of such earnings could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate if certain foreign earnings previously treated as indefinitely reinvested outside the united states are repatriated the related us tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings  we account for uncertain tax positions pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure those positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the refinement of estimates or the realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which such determination is made  we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance if required the determination of our valuation allowance involves assumptions judgments and estimates including forecasted earnings future taxable income and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income  results of operations  total

2012 we had an unfavorable foreign currency exchange effect of 141 million 118 million from the emea region while the remainder of the variance was from the asia pacific and japan region  our

resulting from tax settlements and adjustments to prior year items 3 10 million from lapses of statutes of limitation and 4 2 million for the benefit of the research credit for the fourth quarter of

incentives and research and development credits the us federal research and development credit expired on december 31 2013 partially offset by state income taxes pretax income from international operations was significantly higher in fiscal 2012 due to the sale of our 49 ownership interest in the joint venture to huawei on march 30 2012 for 526 million a significant portion of the sale proceeds was attributable to international tax jurisdictions resulting in a 20 tax rate on the sale of the joint venture reducing the overall tax rate in fiscal 2012 by 3  we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and international tax jurisdictions a substantial portion of our international earnings were generated from subsidiaries organized in ireland and singapore our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict  for further information on the impact of foreign earnings on our effective tax rate see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  see critical accounting estimates above for additional information about our provision for income taxes  in assessing the ability to realize our deferred tax assets we considered whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we considered the following we have historical cumulative book income as measured by the current and prior two years we have strong consistent taxpaying history we have substantial us federal income tax carryback potential and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in part i item 1a risk factors set forth in this annual report we have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and thus that the deferred tax assets as of march 28 2014 of 347 million after application of the valuation allowances described above are realizable on a more likely than not basis  on december 2 2009 we received a revenue agents report from the irs for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years assessing additional taxes due we contested 80 million of the tax assessed and all penalties as a result of negotiations with irs appeals in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we remeasured our liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting in a tax benefit of 52 million we executed the final closing agreement for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years on december 26 2012 accordingly we recorded a further tax benefit of 3 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 based on the closing agreement further we amended our state tax returns for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 to reflect the adjustments in the closing agreement and remeasured our state liability resulting in a benefit of 7 million    45    table of contents the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year although potential resolution of uncertain tax positions involve multiple tax periods and jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both in the next 12 months by between 20 million and 140 million  we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing tax controversies and the impact if any of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions  noncontrolling interest  in fiscal 2011 we completed the acquisition of the identity and authentication business of verisign including a

interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related notes for further information on the notes see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report        2  these amounts are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the table above also includes agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment the amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials        3  we have entered into various noncancelable operating lease agreements that expire on various dates beyond fiscal 2020 the amounts in the table above exclude expected sublease income and includes 3 million in exited or excess facility costs related to restructuring activities        4  as of march 28 2014 we reflected 252 million in longterm income taxes payable related to uncertain tax positions at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond the next twelve months due to uncertainties in the timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits and controversies for further information see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report    49    table of contents indemnifications  in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us in addition our bylaws contain indemnification obligations to our directors officers employees and agents and we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers to give such directors and officers additional contractual assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in our bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers it is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements might not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our consolidated financial statements  we provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party historically payments made under these provisions have been immaterial we monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred  recently issued authoritative guidance  there was no recently issued authoritative guidance that had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements  item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  interest rate risk  as of march 28 2014 we had 210 billion in principal amount of fixedrate senior notes outstanding with a carrying amount of 210 billion and a fair value of 217 billion which fair value is based on level 2 inputs of market prices for similar debt instruments and resulting yields we have performed sensitivity analyses as of march 28 2014 by using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 50 bps movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant on march 28 2014 a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate senior notes by a decrease of approximately 48 million and an increase of approximately 49 million respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt  foreign currency exchange rate risk  we conduct business in 38 currencies through our worldwide operations and as such we are exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and cash equivalents investments receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains    50    table of contents  and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary primarily the euro and singapore dollar our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts with up to six months in duration to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates for all currencies could be experienced the estimated impacts of a five or ten percent appreciation or depreciation in value are as follows                                value of contracts given xappreciation of foreign currency     notionalamount     value of contracts given xdepreciation of foreign

offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates  item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  annual financial statements  the consolidated financial statements and related

statements of the company see note 10 for additional information on our segment reporting change    62    table of contents foreign currency  the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the local foreign currency assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies are remeasured into the functional currencies at current exchange rates and the gains or losses from such remeasurement are recorded in other income expense net assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate on the balance sheet dates revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the year the translation adjustments resulting from this process are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income deferred tax assets and liabilities are established on the cumulative translation adjustment attributable to unremitted foreign earnings that are not intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the event of liquidation of a foreign subsidiary the cumulative translation adjustment attributable to that foreign subsidiary is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income and included in other income expense net for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 net foreign currency transaction losses were 6 million for each of the three years these net losses are included in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of income  revenue recognition  we market and distribute our software products both as standalone products and as integrated product suites we recognize revenue when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 fees are fixed or determinable and 4 collectability is probable if we determine that any one of the four criteria is not met we will defer recognition of revenue until all the criteria are met  we derive revenue primarily from sales of content subscriptions and maintenance and licenses we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments  content subscriptions and maintenance revenue includes arrangements for software maintenance and technical support for our products content and subscription services primarily related to our security products revenue from arrangements where vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of undelivered elements does not exist arrangements for managed security services and softwareasaservice saas offerings these arrangements are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance subscription or service period we enter into perpetual software license agreements through direct sales to customers and indirect sales with distributors and resellers the license agreements generally include product maintenance agreements for which the related revenue is included with content subscriptions and maintenance and is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the agreements  content subscriptions and maintenance revenue also includes professional services revenue consisting primarily of the fees we earn related to consulting and educational services we generally recognize revenue from professional services as the services are performed or upon written acceptance from customers if applicable assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition noted above have been met  license revenue is derived primarily from the licensing of our various products and technology we generally recognize license revenue upon delivery of the product assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition noted above have been met license revenue also includes appliance product revenue we generally recognize appliance product revenue as each product is delivered assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition noted above have been met  for software arrangements that include multiple elements including perpetual software licenses maintenance services and packaged products with content updates and subscriptions we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as license revenue vsoe of each element is based on historical evidence of our standalone sales of these elements to third    63    table of contents  parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance consumer product content updates managed security services subscriptions and arrangements where vsoe does not exist for an undelivered element  for arrangements that include both software and nonsoftware elements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and nonsoftware deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price used for allocating revenue to the deliverables as follows i vsoe ii thirdparty evidence of selling price tpe and iii the best estimate of the selling price esp our appliance products saas and certain other services are considered to be nonsoftware elements in our arrangements  when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe we use esp in the allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis the determination of esp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management taking into consideration the gotomarket strategy pricing factors and historical transactions  indirect channel sales  we sell consumer packaged software products through a multitiered distribution channel for consumer products that include content updates we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sellthrough to endusers as the subscription period commences on the date of sale to the enduser for most other consumer products we recognize packaged product revenue on distributor and reseller channel inventory that is not in excess of specified inventory levels in these channels we offer the right of return of our products under various policies and programs with our distributors resellers and enduser customers we estimate and record reserves for product returns as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channel as an offset to deferred revenue for products with content updates and to revenue for all other products  for security and storage products we generally recognize revenue from the licensing of software products through our indirect sales channel upon sellthrough or with evidence of an enduser for licensing of our software to original equipment manufacturers oems royalty revenue is recognized when the oem reports the sale of the software products to an enduser generally on a quarterly basis in addition to license royalties some oems pay an annual flat fee andor support royalties for the right to sell maintenance and technical support to the enduser we recognize revenue from oem support royalties and fees ratably over the term of the support agreement  we offer channel and enduser rebates for our products our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs which are typically entered into quarterly our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional program actual sales during the promotion the amount of actual redemptions received historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the value of the rebate we estimate and record reserves for channel and enduser rebates as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue as of march 28 2014 and march 29 2013 we had reserves for rebates of 68 million and 79 million respectively for consumer products that include content updates rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue or deferred revenue over the term of the subscription  immaterial correction of previously provided financial information  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we identified a computational error that caused certain lowdollar value multiyear maintenance agreements to be amortized over a period shorter than their contractual term that resulted    64    table of contents  in an understatement of deferred revenue that affected multiple accounting periods we corrected the error by i adjusting our april 1 2011 stockholders equity balance to correct misstatements in years prior to fiscal 2012 and ii recognizing an adjustment in our fiscal 2014 consolidated statements of income to correct misstatements in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 the adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2014 consolidated statements of income reduced revenue by 28 million and net income by 22 million the adjustment related to years prior to fiscal 2012 decreased stockholders equity by 49 million and increased longterm deferred revenue by 67 million as of april 1 2011 the errors were not material to the consolidated statements of income in our fiscal years 2013 and 2012 or the quarters in our fiscal year 2014 the adjustment to correct the cumulative misstatement to stockholders equity was also not material as of april 1 2011  the following table presents the changes to financial statement line items to correct the cumulative misstatement in our fiscal 2012 consolidated balance sheet                        as of march 30 2012

increase of 49 million related to the correction in deferred revenue see sales commissions policy below  the misstatement did not affect our balance of cash and cash equivalents and as a result did not change net cash flows from operating investing or financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows  financial instruments  for assets and liabilities measured at fair value such amounts are based on an expected exit price representing the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability as the case may be in an orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level  the following methods were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value  cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents cash equivalents are carried at amounts that approximate fair value due to the short period of time to maturity  shortterm investments shortterm investments consist of marketable equity and investment securities that are classified as availableforsale and recognized at fair value using level 1 and level 2 inputs which are quoted using market prices independent pricing vendors or other sources to determine the fair value unrealized gains and losses net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income we regularly review our investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been lower than the cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investee credit quality likelihood of recovery and our ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value    65    table of contents equity investments we make equity investments in privatelyheld companies whose businesses are complementary to our business these investments are accounted for under the cost method of accounting as we hold less than 20 of the voting stock outstanding and do not exert significant influence over these companies the investments are included in other longterm assets we assess the recoverability of these investments by reviewing various indicators of impairment if indicators are present a fair value measurement is made by performing a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment if a decline in value is determined to be otherthantemporary impairment would be recognized and included in other income expense net as of march 28 2014 and march 29 2013 we held equity investments in privatelyheld companies of 13 million and 14 million respectively  debt our debt has included senior unsecured notes convertible senior notes and a revolving credit facility our senior unsecured notes are recorded at cost based upon par value at issuance less discounts the discount associated with our senior unsecured notes represents the amount by which the face value exceeds the issuance price the discount and issuance costs recognized initially in the other longterm assets are amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the debt as a noncash charge to interest expense borrowings under our 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility credit facility would be recognized at cost plus accrued interest based upon stated interest rates  trade accounts receivable  trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest bearing we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible trade receivables additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as general and administrative expenses we review our trade receivables by aging category to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues in addition we maintain an allowance for all other receivables not included in the specific reserve by applying specific percentages of projected uncollectible receivables to the various aging categories in determining these percentages we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends we exercise judgment when determining the adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt trends general economic conditions in the us and internationally and changes in customer financial conditions we also offset deferred revenue against accounts receivable when channel inventories are in excess of specified levels and for transactions where collection of a receivable is not considered probable  the following table summarizes trade accounts receivable net of allowances and reserves for the

operating results are included in our consolidated financial statements starting on the date of acquisition the purchase price is equivalent to the fair value of consideration transferred tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition are recorded at the acquisition date fair value goodwill is recognized for the excess of purchase price over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  amounts allocated to assets and liabilities are based upon fair values such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to the identifiable intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable and that of a market participant these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and the estimates are inherently uncertain the separately identifiable intangible assets generally include developed technology customer relationships and trade names we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue related to product support assumed in connection with acquisitions the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin the estimated costs to fulfill the support contracts are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support    67    table of contents for any given acquisition we may identify certain preacquisition contingencies we estimate the fair value of such contingencies which are included under the acquisition method as part of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed as appropriate differences from these estimates are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which they are identified  goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed we review goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired a qualitative assessment is first made to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative testing this initial assessment includes among others consideration of i past current and projected future earnings and equity ii recent trends and market conditions and iii valuation metrics involving similar companies that are publiclytraded and acquisitions of similar companies if available if this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that impairment exists a second analysis is performed involving a comparison between the estimated fair values of our reporting units with their respective carrying amounts including goodwill if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and a third analysis is performed to measure the amount of impairment the third analysis involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets less liabilities if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess  to determine the reporting units fair values in the second step we would use the income approach which is based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that reporting unit the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the income approach is corroborated with the market approach which measures the value of a business through an analysis of recent sales or offerings of a comparable entity we also consider our market capitalization on the date of the analysis to ensure the reasonableness of the sum of our reporting units estimated fair value  our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue operating costs and other relevant factors to determine the reporting units carrying values we allocated assets and liabilities based on either specific identification or by using judgment for the remaining assets and liabilities that are not specific to a reporting unit goodwill was allocated to the reporting units based on a combination of specific identification and relative fair values  intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions we generally recognize assets for customer relationships developed technology which consists of acquired product rights technologies databases and contracts inprocess research and development trademarks and trade names indefinitelived intangible assets are not subject to amortization finitelived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization such amortization is provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets generally from one to eleven years amortization for developed technology is recognized in cost of revenue amortization for customer relationships and certain trade names is recognized in operating expenses  we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset groups carrying amount may not be recoverable recoverability of certain finitelived intangible assets particularly customer relationships and finitelived trade names would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to which the assets are assigned to the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows the asset group is expected to generate if an asset is considered to be impaired such amount would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair    68    table of contents  value recoverability and impairment of other finitelived intangible assets particularly developed technology and patents would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of undiscounted estimated future product revenues offset by estimated future costs to dispose of the product in addition for indefinitelived intangible assets we review such assets for impairment on an annual basis consistent with the timing of the annual evaluation for goodwill similar to goodwill impairment testing a qualitative assessment is first made to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative testing this initial assessment includes among others consideration of i past current and projected future revenues ii recent trends and market conditions including discount rates among others and iii valuation metrics such as royalty rates involving similar companies that are publiclytraded if available if this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that impairment exists a second step analysis is performed involving a comparison between the fair values of the asset or asset group with its respective carrying amounts and the impairment amount is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value these assets generally include trade names and trademarks recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the discounted estimated future cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate if an asset group is considered to be impaired such amount would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset group and its fair value our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and future revenue operating costs and other relevant factors assumptions and estimates about the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are subjective and are affected by changes to our business strategies these estimates may be subject to change  restructuring  restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employeerelated severance charges and contract termination costs employeerelated severance charges are largely based upon substantive severance plans while some are mandated requirements in certain foreign jurisdictions these charges are reflected in the period when both the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable contract termination costs for leased facilities primarily reflect costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the company these charges are reflected in the period when the facility ceases to be used  income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in each jurisdiction in which we operate deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized  we are required to compute our income taxes in each federal state and international jurisdiction in which we operate this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or longterm deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets our judgments assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance if required our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of    69    table of contents  assumptions judgments and estimates including forecasted earnings future taxable income and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income  we apply the authoritative guidance on income taxes that prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements it also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition  this guidance prescribes a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period  stockbased compensation  stockbased compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as expense ratably on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the respective award no compensation cost is ultimately recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service and are forfeited as a result judgment is required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience actual forfeitures may differ if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted when we record an adjustment for the difference in the period that the awards vest or are forfeited  fair value of stockbased awards we have five types of stockbased awards stock options restricted stock units restricted stock awards performancebased restricted stock units and performancecontingent stock units the fair value methodologies and the assumptions and inputs used to derive those fair values are the following           stock options we use the blackscholesmerton option pricing model bsm model to determine the fair value of stock options the determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends we estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and postvesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options the riskfree interest rate is equal to the us treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life if options are granted or assumed without dividendequivalents rights the fair values are discounted by the dividend yield           restricted stock units and restricted stock awards the fair value of each restricted stock unit rsu and restricted stock award rsa is equal to the market value of symantecs common stock on the date of grant because the companys rsus and rsas include dividendequivalent rights the fair values are not discounted by the dividend yield    70    table of contents        performancebased restricted stock units and performancecontingent stock units we use the monte carlo simulation option pricing model monte carlo model to determine the fair value of each performancebased restricted stock unit pru and the fair value and derived service period of each performancecontingent stock unit pcsu the determination of the grant date fair value and derived service periods using a simulation model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards riskfree interest rates and expected dividends expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the prus and pcsus the riskfree interest rate is equal to the us treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life for all periods prior to fiscal 2014 we did not pay cash dividends on our common stock and therefore our expected dividend rate was zero for all such periods presented for awards granted on or subsequent to june 27 2013 we used an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividends declared by our board of directors the compensation expense for prus is initially based on the probability of achieving the target level of the companyspecific performance condition and is adjusted for subsequent changes in the estimated or actual outcome of this performance condition the compensation expense for pcsus is amortized ratably using the graded vesting attribution method over the derived service periods because the companys granted prus and pcsus include dividendequivalent rights the fair values of prus are not discounted by the dividend yield  changes in the valuation assumptions and our related estimates may change the fair value for stockbased compensation and the related expense recognized there have not been any material changes to our stockbased compensation expense due to changes in our valuation assumptions  concentrations of credit risk  a significant portion of our revenue and net income is derived from international sales and independent agents and distributors fluctuations of the us dollar against foreign currencies changes in local regulatory or economic conditions piracy or nonperformance by independent agents or distributors could adversely affect operating results  financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and trade accounts receivable our investment policy limits the amount of credit risk exposure to any one issuer and to any one country we are exposed to credit risks in the event of default by the issuers to the extent of the amount recorded in our consolidated balance sheets the credit risk in our trade accounts receivable is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process reasonably short collection terms and the geographical dispersion of sales transactions we maintain reserves for potential credit losses and such losses have been within managements expectations see note 10 for details of significant customers  advertising and other promotional costs  advertising and other promotional costs are charged to operations as incurred and included in operating expenses these costs totaled 451 million 594 million and 667 million for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively  contingencies  we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation and government investigations in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or proceedings as well as potential ranges of probable losses when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable a determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required if any for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter because of uncertainties related to these matters we base our estimates on the information available at the time    71    table of contents  of our assessment as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims litigation and government investigations and may revise our estimates any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position  sales commissions effective march 30 2013 we changed our accounting policy for sales commissions that are incremental and directly related to customer sales contracts in which revenue is deferred these commission costs are accrued and capitalized upon execution of a noncancelable customer contract and subsequently expensed over the term of such contract in proportion to the related future revenue streams for commission costs where revenue is recognized the related commission costs are recorded in the period of revenue recognition prior to this change in accounting policy commission costs were expensed in the period in which they were incurred the adoption of this accounting policy change has been applied retrospectively to all periods presented in this annual report on form 10k in which the cumulative effect of the change has been reflected as of the beginning of the first period presented deferred commissions as of march 28 2014 and march 29 2013 were 136 million and 159 million respectively during the year ended march 28 2014 we capitalized 172 million of commission costs and amortized 195 million to sales expense respectively during the years ended march 29 2013 and march 30 2012 we deferred 190 million and 210 million of commission costs and amortized 208 million and 186 million to sales expense respectively  we believe this change in accounting policy is preferable as the direct and incremental commission costs are closely related to the revenue and therefore they should be recorded as an asset and recognized as an expense over the same period that the related revenue is recognized  the cumulative effect of the change on accumulated deficit was 98 million as of april 1 2011 the cumulative effect of the change on accumulated deficit and accumulated other comprehensive income was 109 million and 3 million respectively as of march 30 2012 the

financial statements  note 2 fair value measurements  for assets and liabilities measured at fair value such amounts are based on an expected exit price representing the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability as the case may be in an orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level the following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value           level 1 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets           level 2 observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means           level 3 unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value these assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available  assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis  cash equivalents cash equivalents consist of money market funds that are classified as level 1 and corporate securities and commercial paper classified as level 2 all of which have an original maturity of three months or less and the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value  other shortterm investments other shortterm investments consist of us government securities with original maturities greater than three months and are classified as recurring level 1 also included in other shortterm investments are commercial paper federal agency and corporate securities with original maturities greater than three months which are classified as level 2 other shortterm investments are priced using inputs such as actual trade data benchmark yields brokerdealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained from quoted market prices independent pricing vendors or other sources to determine the fair value of these assets  marketable equity securities marketable equity securities are classified as level 1 and are recorded at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  there have been no transfers between fair value measurement levels during fiscal 2014 the following table summarizes our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy                                    march 28 2014

measured and recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  goodwill in fiscal 2012 we recorded an impairment of 19 million as a cumulativeeffect adjustment in accumulated deficit related to an implied fair value measurement made for our former services reporting unit upon the adoption of a new accounting standard the valuation technique used to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill was an income approach which relied upon level 3 inputs which included discounted estimated future cash flows or profit streams  indefinitelived intangible assets in fiscal 2012 we recorded impairment charges of 4 million which reduced the gross carrying value of indefinitelived trade names the fair value amounts were derived using an income approach which required level 3 inputs such as discounted estimated future cash flows on profit streams these impairment charges were due to reductions in expected future cash flows for certain indefinitelived trade names related to the information security

vendors lessors business partners subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us in addition our bylaws contain indemnification obligations to our directors officers employees and agents and we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers to give such directors and officers additional contractual assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in our bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers it is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements might not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our consolidated financial statements  we provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party historically payments made under these provisions have been immaterial we monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred  litigation contingencies  during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we were advised by the commercial litigation branch of the department of justices civil division and the civil division of the us attorneys office for the district of columbia that the government is investigating our compliance with certain provisions of our us general services administration gsa multiple award schedule contract no gs35f0240t effective january 24 2007 including provisions relating to pricing country of origin accessibility and the disclosure of commercial sales practices as reported on the gsas publiclyavailable database our total sales under the gsa schedule contract were approximately 222 million from the period beginning january 2007 and ending september 2012 we are fully cooperating with the investigation and in january 2014 met with representatives of the government who presented us with an initial analysis of our actual damages exposure in the amount of approximately 145 million we are currently in the process of evaluating the governments initial analysis since the initial meeting the governments analysis of our potential damages exposure has fluctuated    83    table of contents it is possible that the investigation could lead to claims or findings of violations of the false claims act and could be material to our results of operations and cash flows for any period resolution of false claims act investigations can ultimately result in the payment of between one and three times the actual damages proven by the government plus civil penalties in some cases depending upon a number of factors considering the preliminary stage of the negotiated resolution process with the government our current estimate of the low end of the range of estimated loss from this matter is 25 million which we have recorded as an offset to revenue  we are also involved in a number of other judicial and administrative proceedings that are incidental to our business although adverse decisions or settlements may occur in one or more of the cases it is not possible to estimate the possible loss or losses from each of these cases the final resolution of these lawsuits individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flow  note 9 stock repurchases  the following table summarizes our stock repurchases

against our deferred tax assets as of march 28 2014 is mainly attributable to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of acquired companies state tax credits and net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions the valuation allowance decreased by a net of 10 million in fiscal 2014 related mostly to the liquidation of a foreign entity  as of march 28 2014 we have us federal net operating losses attributable to various acquired companies of approximately 74 million which if not used will expire between fiscal 2015 and 2032 these net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under internal revenue code 382 but are expected to be fully realized furthermore we have us state net operating loss and credit carryforwards attributable to various acquired companies of approximately 203 million and 70 million respectively if not used our us state net operating losses will expire between fiscal 2015 and 2032 and the majority of our us state credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely in addition we have foreign net operating loss carryforwards attributable to various acquired foreign companies of approximately 280 million net of valuation allowances the majority of which under current applicable foreign tax law can be carried forward indefinitely  in assessing the ability to realize our deferred tax assets we considered whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized we considered the following we have historical cumulative book income as measured by the current and prior two years we have strong consistent taxpaying history we have substantial us federal income tax carryback potential and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities we have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and thus that the deferred tax assets as of march 28 2014 of 347 million after application of the valuation allowances described above are realizable on a more likely than not basis    92    table of contents as of march 28 2014 no provision has been made for federal or state income taxes on 32 billion of cumulative unremitted earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries since we plan to indefinitely reinvest these earnings as of march 28 2014 the

march 28 2014    282                there was a change of 130 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits during the fiscal year as disclosed above this gross liability does not include offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments interest deductions and state income taxes as well as payments made to date  of the total unrecognized tax benefits at march 28 2014 284 million if recognized would favorably affect the companys effective tax rate while 2 million would affect the cumulative translation adjustments however one or more of these unrecognized tax benefits could be subject to a valuation allowance if and when recognized in a future period which could impact the timing of any related effective tax rate benefit  at march 28 2014 before any tax benefits we had 51 million of accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits interest included in our provision for income taxes was an expense of approximately 7 million offset by reductions of 3 million for the year ended march 28 2014 if the accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable amounts accrued will be reduced in the period that such determination is made and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision  we file income tax returns in the us on a federal basis and in many us state and foreign jurisdictions our most significant tax jurisdictions are the us ireland and singapore our tax filings remain subject to examination by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time following the tax year to which those filings relate our 2009 through 2014 fiscal years remain subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs for us federal tax purposes our 2010 through 2014 fiscal years remain

appropriate governmental agencies for singapore tax purposes other significant jurisdictions include california japan the uk and india as of march 28 2014 we are under examination regarding symantec us federal income taxes for the fiscal years 2009 through 2012 in addition we are under examination by the california franchise tax board for the symantec california income taxes for the 2009 through 2010 tax years we are also under audit by the singapore income tax authorities for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 and by the indian income tax authorities for fiscal years 2004 through 2014  on december 2 2009 we received a revenue agents report from the irs for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years assessing additional taxes due we contested 80 million of the tax assessed and all penalties as a result of negotiations with irs appeals in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we remeasured our liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting in a tax benefit of 52 million we executed the final closing agreement for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years on december 26 2012 accordingly we recorded a further tax benefit of 3 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 based on the closing agreement further we amended our state tax returns for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 to reflect the adjustments in the closing agreement and remeasured our state liability resulting in a benefit of 7 million  on september 3 2013 we settled and effectively settled matters with the irs for the symantec 2005 through 2008 fiscal years the result of the settlements effective settlements and remeasurements resulted in a reduction in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal year 2014 of 122 million  the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year although potential resolution of uncertain tax positions involve multiple tax periods and jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both in the next 12 months by between 20 million and 140 million  we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing income tax controversies and the impact if any of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions  note 13 earnings per share  basic and diluted earnings per
