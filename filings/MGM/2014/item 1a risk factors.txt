  you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows in evaluating us you should consider carefully among other things the risks described below  risks relating to our substantial indebtedness            our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 135 billion principal amount of indebtedness outstanding including 28 billion of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured credit facility we had approximately 12 billion of available borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility as of december 31 2013 any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs in addition as of december 31 2013 mgm grand paradise sa mgm grand paradise the company that owns and operates mgm macau had approximately 553 million of debt outstanding under its credit facility we do not guarantee mgm grand paradises obligations under its credit agreement and to the extent mgm macau were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service its indebtedness our ability to make additional investments into that entity is limited by the negative covenants in our senior secured credit facility in addition our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences including            increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions          limiting our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in our business and industry          limiting our ability to borrow additional funds          making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness or          placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to lessleveraged competitors  moreover our businesses are capital intensive for our owned and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties wellmaintained modernized and refurbished such investment requires an ongoing supply of cash and to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained similarly future development projects and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments the incurrence of additional debt guarantees of thirdparty debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations            current and future economic and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service or refinance our indebtedness and to make planned expenditures our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures and investments in joint ventures depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future our ability to receive distributions from joint ventures and our ability to borrow under our senior secured credit facility to the extent of available borrowings if adverse regional and national economic conditions persist worsen or fail to improve significantly we could experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in consumer spending levels and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations continue to receive distributions from joint ventures or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs    14    we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2015 and thereafter our ability to timely refinance and replace such indebtedness will depend upon the foregoing as well as on continued and sustained improvements in financial markets if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments there is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us if at all on satisfactory terms on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements            the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business as well as significantly affect our liquidity and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations covenants governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict among other things our ability to            pay dividends or distributions repurchase or issue equity prepay certain debt or make certain investments          incur additional debt          incur liens on assets          sell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all assets          enter into transactions with affiliates          allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets and          enter into sale and leaseback transactions  our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness any default under our senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth our financial condition our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and could force us to seek protection under the bankruptcy laws  in addition mgm grand paradise and mgm china are coborrowers under an amended and restated credit facility which contains covenants that restrict their ability to engage in certain transactions in particular the mgm china amended and restated credit facility requires mgm china to satisfy various financial covenants including a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio and imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on mgm china and its subsidiaries including mgm grand paradise which include among other things limitations on its ability to pay dividends or distributions to us incur additional debt make investments or engage in other businesses merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer or sell assets  risks related to our business            we face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow the hotel resort and casino industries are highly competitive we do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area and hotel resort and gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our customers to the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations competition will increase major competitors including new entrants have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity or are currently expanding their capacity or constructing new resorts in las vegas and macau also the growth of gaming in areas outside las vegas including california has increased the competition faced by our    15          operations in las vegas and elsewhere in particular as large scale gaming operations on native american tribal lands has increased particularly in california competition has increased  in addition competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the united states and elsewhere result in the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos such as has happened in california for example while our macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near asia including singapore australia new zealand cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and unlicensed gaming operations certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming including malaysia vietnam cambodia and the philippines and others such as japan taiwan and thailand may legalize casino gaming or online gaming in the future furthermore currently mgm grand paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaries open additional facilities for example the facilities currently being developed in cotai macau we would face increased competition furthermore most jurisdictions in which casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical andor geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities which may include acquisitions of existing properties that do arise furthermore certain jurisdictions including nevada and new jersey have also legalized forms of online gaming and the expansion of online gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino resorts  in addition to competition with other hotels resorts and casinos we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow            our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries states and provinces in which we operate these laws regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but generally concern the responsibility financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations as such our gaming regulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or alternatively cease operations in that jurisdiction in addition unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions the regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we are subject to various gaming taxes which are subject to possible increase at any time by various state and federal legislatures and officials increases in gaming taxation could also adversely affect our results for a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect our business see regulation and licensing and exhibit 992 to this annual report on form 10k  further our directors officers key employees and joint venture partners must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities if state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or joint venture partner unsuitable we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the joint venture partner may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in the joint venture state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or joint venture partners to ensure compliance with applicable standards for example as a result of the new jersey division of gaming enforcement the dge    16     investigation of our relationship with our joint venture partner in macau we entered into a settlement agreement with the dge under which we were required to place in trust and sell our 50 ownership interest in borgata and related leased land in atlantic city on august 8 2011 the new jersey casino control commission approved an amendment to the settlement agreement extending the time within which the sale of the trust property was required to occur by 18 months so that until march 24 2013 we had the right to direct the trustee to sell the trust property the divestiture period but if the sale was not concluded by that date the trustee would have been authorized to sell such interests within the following 12 months the terminal sale period on february 13 2013 the settlement agreement was further amended to allow us to reapply to the ccc for licensure in new jersey and to defer expiration of these periods pending the outcome of the licensure process if the ccc denies our licensure request then the divestiture period will immediately end and the terminal sale period will immediately begin which will result in our borgata interest being disposed of by the trustee pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities  in macau current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are for the most part fairly recent and there is little precedent on the interpretation of these laws and regulations these laws and regulations are complex and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations or issue new or modified regulations that differ from mgm chinas interpretation which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations in addition mgm chinas activities in macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies we cannot assure you that mgm china will be able to obtain all necessary approvals and any such failure to do so may materially affect its longterm business strategy and operations macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions however to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues  in addition to gaming regulations we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters smoking employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising for instance we are subject to certain federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances including the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the oil pollution act of 1990 under various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted for example illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places including bars restaurants work places schools and casinos and in january 2013 casinos in macau including mgm china implemented a smoking ban in which a portion of casino floors are to be designated nonsmoking the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance  in addition we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various antimoney laundering laws and regulations such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted any violations of the antimoney laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows    17            our business is affected by economic and market conditions in the markets in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending on conventions and business development economic contraction economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for hotels casino resorts trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury amenities we offer in addition changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel an unstable job market perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and future acts of terrorism aria bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage in particular may be affected by economic conditions in the far east and all of our nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the united states and california in particular a recession economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts which would adversely affect our operating results for example the recent recession and downturn in consumer and corporate spending have had a negative impact on our results of operations in addition the weak housing and real estate marketboth generally and in nevada particularlyhas negatively impacted citycenters ability to sell residential units  in addition since we expect a significant number of customers to come to mgm macau from mainland china general economic and market conditions in china could impact our financial prospects any slowdown in economic growth or changes to chinas current restrictions on travel and currency movements could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china to mgm macau as well as the amounts they are willing to spend in the casino for example from 2008 through 2010 china readjusted its visa policy toward macau and limited the number of visits that some mainland chinese citizens may make to macau in a given time period in addition effective october 2013 china banned zerofare tour groups involving no or low upfront payments and compulsory shopping which were popular among visitors to macau from mainland china it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect become more restrictive or be readopted in the future these developments have had and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have the effect of reducing the number of visitors to macau from mainland china which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in macau  furthermore our operations in macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources and the adequacy of transportation infrastructure in macau to accommodate the demand from future development our success in macau will be impacted by our ability to retain and hire employees we compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of new developments in macau while we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resort certain macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications in addition because additional casino projects are under construction and are to be developed in the future existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to macau if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau the desirability of macau as a gaming destination as well as the results of operations at our development in cotai macau could be negatively impacted            we have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china in connection with the initial public offering of mgm china the holding company that indirectly owns and operates mgm macau we entered into a deed of noncompete undertakings with mgm china and ms pansy ho pursuant to which we are restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the peoples republic of china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china while gaming is currently prohibited in china hong kong and taiwan if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete with our competitors in these locations could be limited until the earliest of i march 31 2020 ii the date    18          mgm chinas ordinary shares cease to be listed on the stock exchange of hong kong limited or iii the date when our ownership of mgm china shares is less than 20 of the then issued share capital of mgm china            the macau government can terminate mgm grand paradises subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating mgm grand paradise the macau government can exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession in 2017 or the macau government can refuse to grant mgm grand paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2020 any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the subconcession in the event of fundamental noncompliance by mgm grand paradise with applicable macau laws or mgm grand paradises basic obligations under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such noncompliance with its fundamental obligations under the subconcession contract within a period to be stipulated by the macau government upon such termination all of mgm grand paradises casino area premises and gamingrelated equipment would be transferred automatically to the macau government without compensation to mgm grand paradise and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will perform all of its obligations under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the macau government  furthermore under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the macau government might promulgate in the future we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macau businesses if any disagreement arises between mgm grand paradise and the macau government regarding the interpretation of or mgm grand paradises compliance with a provision of the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the macau government during any consultation or negotiation mgm grand paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the macau government currently there is no precedent concerning how the macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above the loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in macau which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  in addition the subconcession contract expires on march 31 2020 unless the subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended all of mgm grand paradises casino premises and gamingrelated equipment will automatically be transferred to the macau government on that date without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations beginning on april 20 2017 the macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one years prior notice in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right mgm grand paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and nongaming revenue generated by mgm grand paradise excluding the convention and exhibition facilities during the taxable year prior to the redemption before deducting interest depreciation and amortization multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to renew or extend the subconcession contract on terms favorable to mgm grand paradise or at all we also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed the compensation paid to mgm grand paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues            we are required to build and open our development in cotai macau by january 2018 if we are unable to meet this deadline and the deadline for the development is not extended we may lose the land concession which would prohibit us from operating any facilities developed under such land    19          concession the land concession for the approximately 178 acre site on cotai macau was officially gazetted on january 9 2013 if we are unable to build and open our proposed resort and casino by january 2018 and the deadline is not extended the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the land concession contract a loss of the land concession could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows            mgm grand paradise is dependent upon gaming promoters for a significant portion of gaming revenues in macau gaming promoters who promote gaming and draw highend customers to casinos are responsible for a significant portion of mgm grand paradises gaming revenues in macau with the rise in gaming in macau the competition for relationships with gaming promoters has increased while mgm grand paradise is undertaking initiatives to strengthen relationships with gaming promoters there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain or grow relationships with gaming promoters if mgm grand paradise is unable to maintain or grow relationships with gaming promoters or if gaming promoters are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our highend customers mgm grand paradises ability to grow gaming revenues will be hampered  in addition the quality of gaming promoters is important to mgm grand paradises and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with gaming licenses while mgm grand paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters we cannot assure you that the gaming promoters with whom mgm grand paradise is or becomes associated with will meet the high standards insisted upon if a gaming promoter falls below mgm grand paradises standards mgm grand paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gaming regulators with authority over our operations  we also grant credit lines to our gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the recoverability of these loans            extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business which could harm our business and results of operations certain of our casino properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions including but not limited to hurricanes in the united states and severe typhoons in macau such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas in addition our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage a severe drought of extensive duration experienced in las vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adversely affect our business and results of operations although we maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme weather conditions such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect if at all on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions furthermore such extreme weather conditions may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows            because our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified given that our major resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the las vegas tourism industry for example the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from las vegas can adversely affect our business we cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from las vegas but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand can impact the number of visitors to our resorts additionally there is one principal interstate highway between las vegas and southern california where a large number of our customers reside capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities    20            we extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables we conduct a portion of our gaming activities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments table games players typically are issued more markers than slot players and highend players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts highend gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming and variances in winloss results attributable to highend gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter furthermore the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these highend customers could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cashflows we issue markers to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant in the opinion of management an extension of credit in addition mgm grand paradise extends credit to certain gaming promoters and those promoters can extend credit to their customers uncollectible receivables from highend customers and gaming promoters could have a significant impact on our results of operations  while gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the united states of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from us courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations  furthermore we expect that mgm macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions including macau to the extent mgm macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions mgm macau may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because among other reasons courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm macau may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts moreover under applicable law mgm macau remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers  even where gaming debts are enforceable they may not be collectible our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results            we may incur impairments to goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets which could negatively affect our future profits we review our goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative guidance significant negative trends reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in writedowns and impairment charges in the past and if one or more of such events occurs in the future additional impairment charges may be required in future periods if we are required to record additional impairment charges this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations            leisure and business travel especially travel by air are particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events such as terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility we are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air since most of our customers travel by air to our las vegas and macau properties any terrorist act outbreak of hostilities escalation of war or any actual or perceived threat to the security of travel by air could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows furthermore although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts insurance coverage against loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable            investing through partnerships or joint ventures including citycenter decreases our ability to manage risk in addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement    21          our business directly we have from time to time invested and expect to continue to invest as a coventurer joint venturers often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets therefore the operation of a joint venture is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters in addition joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that the coventurer might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives consequently actions by a coventurer might subject hotels and resorts owned by the joint venture to additional risk further we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners alternatively our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent additionally should a joint venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for our partners or coventurers share of joint venture liabilities  for instance citycenter which is 50 owned and managed by us has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations if citycenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our partners are unable to support future funding requirements as necessary such event could have adverse financial consequences to us in addition the agreements governing citycenters indebtedness subject citycenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness place liens upon assets make distributions to us make certain investments consummate certain asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates including us and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets the citycenter third amended and restated credit facility also includes certain financial covenants that require citycenter to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio as defined in citycenters third amended and restated credit facility for each quarter commencing on march 31 2014 we cannot be sure that citycenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test  in addition in accordance with our joint venture agreement and the citycenter third amended and restated credit facility we provided a cost overrun guarantee which is secured by our interests in the assets of circus circus las vegas and certain adjacent undeveloped land            any of our future construction or development projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks which could have a material adverse impact on related project timetables costs and our ability to complete the projects  any of our future construction or development projects will be subject to a number of risks including            lack of sufficient or delays in the availability of financing          changes to plans and specifications          engineering problems including defective plans and specifications          shortages of and price increases in energy materials and skilled and unskilled labor and inflation in key supply markets          delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals          changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations applicable to gaming leisure residential real estate development or construction projects          labor disputes or work stoppages          disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors          personal injuries to workers and other persons          environmental health and safety issues including site accidents and the spread of viruses          weather interferences or delays          fires typhoons and other natural disasters    22            geological construction excavation regulatory and equipment problems and          other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases  the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs delay or prevent the construction development or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future construction projects which we might undertake for instance we expect the total development costs of our cotai project to be approximately 29 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs we expect total development costs of our maryland project to be approximately 10 billion and our massachusetts project to be approximately 690 million each excluding capitalized interest and land related costs while we believe that the overall budgets for these developments are reasonable these development costs are estimates and the actual development costs may be higher than expected we cannot guarantee that our construction costs or total project costs for future projects including our developments in cotai and maryland and in massachusetts if we are awarded the license will not increase beyond amounts initially budgeted            our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer in addition our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future although we have all risk property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss such as fire natural disasters acts of war or terrorism each policy has certain exclusions in addition our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty in addition certain casualty events such as labor strikes nuclear events acts of war loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism deterioration or corrosion insect or animal damage and pollution may not be covered at all under our policies therefore certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses  in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event  we renew our insurance policies other than our builders risk insurance on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy

a codelevel earthquake by demolishing the building and we are exposed to risks prior to or in connection with the demolition process after partial construction of the harmon citycenter discovered that in certain elements of the building known as link beams the reinforcing steel had been installed incorrectly by citycenters general contractor perini building company perini and its subcontractors after additional structural defects in other areas of the harmon were discovered further construction at the harmon was indefinitely stopped during the third quarter of 2010 citycenter determined that the harmon was unlikely to be completed using the existing partially completed structure as it now stands in response to a request by the clark county building division the building division citycenter engaged an engineer to conduct an analysis based on all available information as to the structural stability of the harmon under buildingcodespecified load combinations on july 11 2011 that engineer submitted the results of his analysis of the harmon tower and podium in its current asbuilt condition the engineer opined among other things that in a codelevel earthquake using either the permitted or current code specified loads it is likely that critical structural members in the tower will fail and become incapable of supporting gravity loads leading to a partial or complete collapse of the tower there is missing or misplaced reinforcing steel in columns beams shear walls and transfer walls throughout the structure of the tower below the twentyfirst floor based on this engineering opinion the building division requested a plan of action from citycenter citycenter    23          informed the building division that it decided to abate the potential for structural

state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities from time to time legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws affecting the gaming industry periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase gaming taxes or fees depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected for instance income generated from gaming operations of mgm grand paradise currently has the benefit of a corporate tax exemption in macau which exempts us from paying the 12 complimentary tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games we expect to continue to benefit from this tax exemption through the end of 2016 and believe that we will be granted additional fiveyear exemptions in the future however we cannot assure you that any extensions of the tax exemption will be granted            conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of mgm china the holding company for mgm grand paradise which owns and operates mgm macau as a result of the initial public offering of shares of mgm china common stock mgm china now has stockholders who are not affiliated with us and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers andor directors of mgm china may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of mgm china decisions that could have different implications for us and mgm china including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with mgm china may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest
