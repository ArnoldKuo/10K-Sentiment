variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend gaming customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year while our results do not depend on key individual customers a significant portion of our operating income is generated from

that resort  more detailed information about each of our operating resorts can be found in exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference  wholly owned domestic resorts over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities  our casino operations feature a variety of slots table games and race and sports book wagering in addition we offer our premium players access to highlimit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere  mgm china on june 3 2011 we and ms ho pansy catilina chiu king ms pansy ho completed a reorganization of the capital structure of mgm china pursuant to which we acquired an additional 1 interest in mgm china and thereby became the owner of 51 of mgm china through the acquisition of the additional 1 interest of mgm china we obtained a controlling interest and were required to consolidate mgm china as of june 3 2011 prior to the transaction we held a 50 interest in mgm grand paradise sa mgm grand paradise which was accounted for under the equity method we believe our ownership interest in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability asia is the fastestgrowing gaming market in the world and macau is the worlds largest gaming destination in terms of revenue and has continued to grow over the past few years despite the global economic downturn  our current mgm china operations relate to mgm macau and the development of a casino resort on the cotai strip in macau discussed further below revenues at mgm macau are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by mgm grand paradise the macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession was granted by sociedade de jogos de macau    3     sa and expires in 2020 the macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations  in october 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of macau to develop a resort and casino on an approximately 178 acre site in cotai macau mgm cotai the land concession contract became effective when the macau government published the agreement in the official gazette of macau on january 9 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years under the terms of the land concession contract mgm grand paradise is required to complete the development of the land by january 2018 also in october 2012 mgm china and mgm grand paradise as coborrowers successfully closed on a 20 billion amended and restated credit facility agreement which we believe ensures the necessary funding for the mgm cotai project  mgm china has finalized the design of the mgm cotai project and construction of the foundation commenced in 2013 in may 2013 mgm china entered into an agreement with china state construction engineering corporation to serve as the sole general contractor for the project mgm cotai will be an integrated casino hotel and entertainment resort with approximately 1600 hotel rooms 500 gaming tables and up to 2500 slots the total estimated project budget is 29 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs  customers and competition  our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments we compete against gaming companies as well as other hospitality companies in the markets we operate in neighboring markets and in other parts of the world including nongaming resort destinations such as hawaii our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states and internationally  our primary methods of successful competition include            locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets          constructing and maintaining highquality resorts and facilities including luxurious guestrooms stateoftheart convention facilities and premier dining entertainment retail and other amenities          recruiting training and retaining wellqualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service          providing unique mustsee entertainment attractions and          developing distinctive and memorable marketing promotional and customer loyalty programs  wholly owned domestic resorts our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the las vegas area including major hotel casinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotel casinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the strip and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority there were approximately 151000 guestrooms in las vegas at december 31 2013 and 2012 at december 31 2013 we operated approximately 27 of the guestrooms in las vegas las vegas visitor volume was 397 million in both 2013 and 2012  the las vegas market includes leisure travel customers premium gaming customers convention customers including small meetings trade associations and corporate incentive programs and tour and travel customers our luxury wholly owned resorts including bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage appeal to the upper end of each market segment balancing their business by using the convention and tour and travel segments to fill the midweek and offpeak periods our marketing strategy for new yorknew york luxor and monte carlo is aimed at attracting middle to uppermiddleincome customers largely from the leisure travel and the tour and travel segments excalibur and circus circus las vegas generally cater to the valueoriented and middleincome leisure travel and tour and travel segments    4    outside of las vegas our other nevada operations compete with each other and with many other similarly sized and larger operations our nevada resorts located outside of las vegas appeal primarily to the valueoriented leisure traveler and the valueoriented local customer a significant number of our customers at these resorts come from california  outside of nevada our resorts primarily compete for customers in local and regional gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region for example in detroit michigan we compete with a casino in nearby windsor canada and with native american casinos in michigan in biloxi mississippi we compete with regional riverboat and landbased casinos in louisiana native american casinos in central mississippi and with casinos in florida and the bahamas  mgm china our key competitors in macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires if the macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows additionally several concessionaires have expansion plans announced or underway primarily located on the cotai strip the properties currently operating in cotai have achieved a higher growth rate than those located on the macau peninsula we expect competition in the macau market to continue to increase as more capacity is brought online in the near future we also encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of asia and around the world including singapore malaysia the philippines australia new zealand las vegas cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region  the three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market are vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations  vip gaming play is sourced both internally and externally externally sourced vip gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who offer vip players various services such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel food and beverage services gaming promoters operate vip gaming rooms within the property in exchange for their services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of commission we extend credit and provide complimentaries to our internally sourced vip clientele without the use of an intermediary these clientele are acquired through our direct marketing efforts  the main floor gaming operation in macau is also referred to as the mass gaming operation unlike vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future to target premium main floor players in order to grow revenue and improve yield we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadiumstyle electronic table games terminals which includes both table games and slots to the main floor gaming area the amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor players  corporate and other much like our wholly owned resorts our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts aria which we manage and own 50 through the citycenter joint venture appeals to the upper end of each segment in the las vegas market and competes with our wholly owned luxury casino resorts and other luxury resorts on the las vegas strip our other unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers
