  executive overview  our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we believe that we own and invest in several of the premier casino resorts in the world and have continually reinvested in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financings fund capital expenditures and provide excess cash flow for future development we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities  results of operations from our wholly owned domestic resorts for the year ended december 31 2013 improved compared to the prior year as a result of increased casino and hotel revenues as general economic conditions continue to improve in the las vegas strip market as reported by the las vegas convention and visitors authority casino revenues increased 48 in addition the average room rate for the las vegas strip increased 28 compared to the same period in the prior year while visitation to las vegas was flat for the same period  in macau results of operations also improved for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of strong gaming volumes benefiting from economic growth in china despite concerns about the sustainability of economic growth in china we expect the macau market to continue to grow as the result of a large and growing asian middle class and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within macau according to statistics published by the statistics census service of the macau government visitor arrivals were 29 million in 2013 a 4 increase compared to 2012 gross casino revenues for the macau market increased 19 compared to the prior year with increases in both vip and main floor volumes  our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital in december 2012 we completed a comprehensive refinancing transaction that generated a significant reduction in interest expense for 2013 and extended the maturities of our longterm debt allowing us to maximize free cash flow and further enhance our deleveraging efforts in addition our access to lower cost financing and ability to finance development opportunities has also improved significantly as a result of these transactions  while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities in macau we plan to spend approximately 29 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs to develop a resort and casino featuring approximately 1600 hotel rooms 500 gaming tables and up to 2500 slots built on an approximately 178 acre site in cotai macau in addition we have been actively pursuing development opportunities in markets such as maryland and massachusetts  in december 2013 our subsidiary mgm national harbor llc mgm national harbor was awarded the license to operate the sixth and final casino under current statutes in the state of maryland by the maryland video lottery facility location commission to build and operate a worldclass destination resort casino in prince georges county at national harbor we currently expect the cost to develop and construct mgm national harbor to be approximately 10 billion excluding capitalized interest and land related costs we expect that the resort will include a casino with approximately 3600 slots 160 table games including poker a 300suite hotel with luxury spa and rooftop pool highend branded retail fine and casual dining a dedicated 3000 seat theater venue 35000 square feet of meeting and event space and a 5000space parking structure    36    we are the only remaining applicant for the casino license in western massachusetts one of three zones designated by legislation in december 2013 a unanimous vote from the massachusetts gaming commission mgc found us a suitable candidate for a casino license in the commonwealth we have since submitted to the mgc a completed license application for the next phase of the licensing process however there can be no assurance that the mgc will ultimately award us the license mgm springfield is proposed for 145 acres of land between union and state streets and columbus avenue and main street we currently expect the cost to develop and construct mgm springfield to be approximately 690 million excluding capitalized interest and land related costs  in 2013 we formed a 5050 joint venture las vegas arena company llc lva with a subsidiary of anschutz entertainment group inc a leader in sports entertainment and promotions to design construct and operate an arena on a parcel of our land located between frank sinatra drive and new yorknew york adjacent to the las vegas strip the proposed arena is anticipated to seat between 18000  20000 people and is currently scheduled to be completed in 2016 such development is estimated to cost approximately 350 million and is contingent on lva obtaining permanent financing  reportable segments  we have two reportable segments that are based on the regions in which we operate wholly owned domestic resorts and mgm china we currently operate 15 wholly owned resorts in the united states mgm chinas operations consist of the mgm macau resort and casino mgm macau and the development of a casino resort in cotai we have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates our mgm hospitality operations and certain other corporate and management operations citycenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate which we also manage for a fee our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as corporate and other operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results  wholly owned domestic resorts at december 31 2013 our wholly owned domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts           las vegas nevada   bellagio mgm grand las vegas including the signature mandalay bay the mirage luxor new yorknew york excalibur monte carlo and circus circus las vegas      other   mgm grand detroit in detroit michigan beau rivage in biloxi mississippi gold strike tunica in tunica mississippi circus circus reno in reno nevada gold strike in jean nevada and railroad pass in henderson nevada  over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customer groups and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities as a result of our leveraged business model our operating results are significantly affected by our ability to generate operating revenues also we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts in las vegas nevada which exposes us to certain risks such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts and from the expansion of gaming in the united states generally  key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts are            gaming revenue indicators table games drop and slots handle volume indicators win or hold percentage which is not fully controllable by us our normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 18 to 22 of table games drop and our normal slots hold percentage is in the range of 80 to 85 of slots handle and    37            hotel revenue indicators hotel occupancy a volume indicator average daily rate adr a price indicator and revenue per available room revpar a summary measure of hotel results combining adr and occupancy rate our calculation of adr which is the average price of occupied rooms per day includes the impact of complimentary rooms complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or cash rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis particularly to casino customers includes a disproportionate suite component the composite adr including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the adr for cash rooms reflecting the higher retail value of suites  mgm china on june 3 2011 we and ms ho pansy catilina chiu king ms pansy ho completed a reorganization of the capital structure and the initial public offering of 760 million shares of mgm china on the stock exchange of hong kong limited the ipo representing 20 of the post issuance base capital stock of mgm china at an offer price of hkd 1534 per share pursuant to this reorganization we acquired through a wholly owned subsidiary an additional 1 of the overall capital stock of mgm china for hkd 1534 per share or approximately 75 million and thereby became the owner of 51 of mgm china following the ipo the underwriters exercised their overallotment rights with respect to 59 million shares mgm china owns mgm grand paradise the macau company that owns the mgm macau and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions and is in the process of developing a gaming resort in cotai see below for additional information about the cotai development project  through the acquisition of the additional 1 interest of mgm china we obtained a controlling interest and were required to consolidate mgm china as of june 3 2011 prior to the ipo we held a 50 interest in mgm grand paradise which was accounted for under the equity method the acquisition of the controlling financial interest was accounted for as a business combination and we recognized 100 of the assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests of mgm china at fair value at the date of acquisition the fair value of the equity of mgm china was determined by the ipo transaction price and equaled approximately 75 billion the carrying value of our equity method investment was significantly less than our share of the fair value of mgm china resulting in a 35 billion gain on the acquisition  we believe our investment in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability asia is the fastestgrowing gaming market in the world and macau is the worlds largest gaming destination in terms of revenue  in october 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of macau to develop a resort and casino on an approximately 178 acre site in cotai macau the land concession contract became effective when the macau government published the agreement in the official gazette of macau on january 9 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years the total land premium payable to the macau government for the land concession contract is approximately 161 million and is composed of a down payment and eight additional semiannual payments as of december 31 2013 mgm china had paid 71 million of the contract premium recorded within other longterm assets net in january 2014 mgm china paid the second semiannual payment of 15 million under the land concession contract including interest on the six remaining semiannual payments mgm china has approximately 88 million remaining payable for the land concession contract in addition mgm grand paradise is required to pay the macau government approximately 269000 per year in rent during the course of development of the land and approximately 681000 per year in rent once the development is completed the annual rent is subject to review by the macau government every five years under the terms of the land concession contract mgm grand paradise is required to complete the development of the land by january 2018 in october 2012 mgm china and mgm grand paradise as coborrowers successfully closed on a 20 billion amended and restated credit facility agreement the proceeds of such facility are expected to be used in part to finance the construction of the cotai project mgm china has finalized the design of the mgm cotai project hired a general contractor and construction of the foundation commenced in 2013    38    revenues at mgm macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by inhouse vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through the use of gaming promoters gaming promoters introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau assist these customers with travel arrangements and extend gaming credit to these players in exchange for their services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of commission inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate the main floor gaming operation in macau is also referred to as the mass gaming operation mgm macau main floor operations primarily consist of walkin and day trip visitors unlike vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future  vip gaming at mgm macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips called rolling chips gaming promoters purchase these rolling chips from mgm macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players the rolling chips allow mgm macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters clients in order to determine vip gaming play gaming promoter commissions are based on either a percentage of actual win plus a monthly complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the rolling chip turnover their customers generate or a percentage of the rolling chip turnover plus discounted offerings on nongaming amenities the estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to vip customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense inhouse vip commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue  in addition to the key performance indicators used by our wholly owned domestic resorts mgm macau utilizes turnover which is the sum of rolling chip wagers won by mgm macau calculated as rolling chips purchased plus rolling chips exchanged less rolling chips returned turnover provides a basis for measuring vip casino win percentage win for vip gaming operations at mgm macau is in the range of 27 to 30 of turnover mgm macaus main floor normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 25 to 35 of table games drop slots hold percentage at mgm macau is in the range of 5 to 6 of slots handle  corporate and other corporate and other includes our investments in unconsolidated affiliates mgm hospitality and certain management

to defer expiration of these periods pending the outcome of the licensure process if the ccc denies our licensure request then the divestiture period will immediately end and the terminal sale period

value was determined based on recent indications from market participants in the fourth quarter of 2013 we sold the sloan land  investment in grand victoria at june 30 2013 we reviewed the carrying value of our grand victoria investment for impairment due to a higher than anticipated decline in operating results and loss of market share as a result of the opening of a new riverboat casino in the illinois market as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flows compared to the prior forecast we used a blended discounted cash flow analysis and guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair value from a market participants viewpoint key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capital expenditures a longterm growth rate of 2 and a discount rate of 11 key assumptions in the guideline public company method included business enterprise value multiples selected based on the range of multiples in

of 170 million for our 50 interest we intend to and believe we will be able to retain our investment in grand victoria however due to the extent of the shortfall and our assessment of the uncertainty of fully recovering our investment we determined that the impairment was otherthantemporary  at june 30 2012 we reviewed the carrying value of our grand victoria investment for impairment due to a

necessary to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge for our investment in borgata of 62 million as of december 31 2011 using an estimated fair value for our investment of 185 million based on a discounted cash flow analysis key assumptions in such analysis include managements estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capital expenditures an appropriate discount rate and longterm growth rate at the time there was significant uncertainty surrounding borgatas future operating results due primarily to the planned opening of a major new resort in the atlantic city market during 2012 and other additional competition expected in surrounding markets as a result for purposes of this analysis we reflected a decrease in forecasted cash flows in 2012 and 2013 additionally we

vegas strip which we have been holding for future development during 2012 we focused our development efforts on other jurisdictions which led to us reviewing our significant development land holdings for impairment indicators due to our focus on future development outside of the las vegas area we did not believe it was likely we would recover the carrying value of our 335 acres of land on the north end of the las vegas strip on an undiscounted basis therefore we recorded an impairment charge of 366 million as of december 31 2012 based on an estimated fair value of 214 million for the land

december 31 2012 based on an estimated fair value of 125 million for the land due to our focus on future development outside of atlantic city the deterioration the atlantic city market had experienced and the initial underperformance of a new resort that opened in 2012 we did not believe it was likely we would recover the carrying value of this land on an undiscounted basis we determined fair value of the land using a market approach based on assessment of comparable land sales in atlantic city adjusted for size and location factors based on comparisons to our land  investment in silver legacy

circus reno longlived assets for impairment using revised operating forecasts developed by management for that resort in the third quarter of 2011 due to the then current and forecasted market conditions and results of operations through september 30 2011 being lower than previous forecasts we recorded a noncash impairment charge of    46     80 million in the third quarter of 2011

such losses in addition our foreign jurisdiction book income is taxed at essentially a zero percent tax rate due primarily to the exemption from macaus 12 complementary tax on gaming profits consequently absent nonrecurring taxation events our effective tax rate would have been approximately 5 in 2013 however due primarily to tax expense resulting from remeasuring the macau net deferred tax liability due to the extension of the amortization period of the mgm china gaming subconcession upon effectiveness of the cotai land concession offset in part by tax benefit resulting from audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitation the effective tax rate for 2013 approximated the 35 us statutory rate the income tax benefit on pretax loss in 2012 was substantially below the 35 statutory rate due primarily to the fact that we began recording a valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets during the year we recorded an income tax benefit in 2011 even though we had pretax income for the year because we did not provide us deferred taxes on the 35 billion gain recorded on the acquisition of the controlling financial interest in mgm china excluding the mgm china gain we would have provided income tax benefit at an effective tax rate of 607 for 2011 higher than the federal statutory rate due primarily to an income tax benefit resulting from a decrease to the macau net deferred tax liability recorded to reflect an assumed fiveyear extension of the exemption from complementary tax on gaming profits and a lower effective tax rate on mgm china earnings  cash taxes paid in 2013 and 2012 consisted primarily of foreign and state taxes the net refund of cash taxes in 2011 was due primarily to the carryback to prior years of us federal income tax net operating losses incurred in 2010 and 2009 respectively all us net operating loss carryback refund potential was realized as a result of these carrybacks and tax net operating losses may now only be

transactions net and the gain on the mgm china transaction adjusted property ebitda is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the mgm resorts stock option plan which is not allocated to each property mgm china recognizes stock compensation expense related to its stock compensation plan which is included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for mgm china adjusted ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes these measures are 1 widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industry and 2 a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects property transactions net includes normal recurring disposals gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period in addition capital allocation tax planning financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level therefore we use adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of wholly owned domestic resorts operating performance  adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments    49     taxes and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries

decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts and the timing of capital investments to maintain the quality of our resorts the amounts of which can vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms future capital expenditures could vary from our current expectations depending on the progress of our development

china adopted a distribution policy pursuant to which it may make semiannual distributions in an aggregate amount per year not to exceed 35 of its anticipated consolidated annual profits in accordance with the policy mgm china may also declare special distributions from time to time the determination to make distributions will be made at the discretion of the mgm china board of directors and will be based upon mgm chinas operations and earnings development pipeline cash flows financial condition capital and other reserve requirements and surplus general financial conditions contractual restrictions including restrictions on its ability to pay dividends or distributions in the mgm china credit facility and any other conditions or factors which the board of directors deems relevant as

collateralized by substantially all of the assets of circus circus las vegas as well as certain undeveloped land adjacent to that property the terms of the amended and restated completion guarantee provide citycenter the ability to utilize up to 72 million of net residential proceeds to fund construction costs or to reimburse us for construction costs previously expended as of december 31 2013 citycenter is holding approximately 72 million in a separate bank account representing the remaining condo proceeds available to fund completion guarantee obligations or be reimbursed to us in accordance with the amended and restated completion guarantee such amounts can only be used to fund construction lien obligations or reimbursed to us once the perini litigation is settled  as of december 31 2013 we had funded 716 million under the completion guarantee and have accrued a liability of 97 million which includes estimated litigation costs related to the resolution of disputes with contractors concerning the final construction costs and estimated amounts to be paid to contractors through the    57     legal process related to the perini litigation we do not believe it is reasonably possible we could be liable for amounts in excess of what we have accrued our estimated obligation has been offset by 72 million of condominium proceeds received by citycenter which are available to fund construction lien claims upon the resolution of the perini litigation also our accrual reflects certain estimated offsets to the amounts claimed by the contractors moreover we have not accrued for any contingent payments to citycenter related to the harmon component which will not be completed using the building as it now stands see note 11 in the accompanying financial statements for discussion of the status of the harmon  we do not believe we would be responsible for funding under the completion guarantee any additional remediation efforts that might be required with respect to the harmon however our view is based on a number of developing factors including with respect to ongoing litigation with citycenters contractors actions by local officials and other developments related to the citycenter venture all of which are subject to change  principal debt arrangements  our longterm debt consists of publicly held senior senior subordinated and convertible

affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a fullscale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment we have not historically guaranteed financing

amounts and expected maturities of debt outstanding at december 31 2013 and managements forecasted libor rates for our senior credit facility and hibor rates for the mgm grand paradise credit facility    2  approximately 75 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and other tax liabilities are excluded from the table as we cannot reasonably estimate when examination and other activity related to these amounts will conclude or when these amounts will be paid    3  under our completion guarantee for citycenter we are committed to fund amounts in excess of currently funded project costs based on current forecasted expenditures we estimate that we will be required to fund approximately 97 million for such guarantee    4  the amount for 2014 includes approximately 500 million of a total of 13 billion of construction commitments related to mgm cotai 115 million related to employment agreements 102 million for entertainment agreements and 38 million of open purchase orders other commitments include various contracted amounts including information technology advertising maintenance and other service agreements our largest entertainment commitments consist of minimum contractual payments to cirque du soleil which performs shows at several of our resorts our contractual commitments for these shows generally do not exceed 12 months and are based on our ability to exercise certain termination rights however we expect these shows to continue for longer periods  while we have significant indebtedness we believe we have the ability to meet known obligations including principal and interest obligations as well as planned capital expenditures over the next few years with cash flows from operations and availability under our senior credit facility we have 537 million of maturities of longterm debt in 2014 and the price per share of our common stock as of december 31 2013 was above the conversion price of our 145 billion 425 convertible senior notes due 2015 see liquidity and capital resources  other factors affecting liquidity for further discussion of anticipated uses of cash  critical accounting policies and estimates  managements discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates however by their nature judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates    60    business combinations  we accounted for our acquisition of mgm china in june 2011 as a business combination and have historically had significant acquisitions accounted for as business combinations in a business combination we determine the fair value of acquired assets including identifiable intangible assets assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests the fair value of the acquired business is allocated to the acquired assets assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests based on their fair value with any remaining fair value allocated to goodwill this allocation process requires use of estimates and assumptions including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets identifiable finitelife intangible assets such as certain license rights and customer lists are amortized over the intangible assets estimated useful life the method of amortization reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed if determinable normally estimated based on estimated future cash flows of the intangible asset goodwill as well as other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment as discussed further below  allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable  marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts in addition mgm china extends credit to certain inhouse vip gaming customers and gaming promoters our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau at december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 31 and 27 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states at december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 57 and 63 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability among other factors when we issue credit to customers who are not residents of the united states  we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customers financial condition collection history and any other known information we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate  in addition to enforceability issues the collectibility of unpaid markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a regions economy occur    61    the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables                    at december 31        2013     2012        in thousands     casino receivables     309620        294312      allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable     73081        90452      allowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable     24        31     percentage of casino accounts outstanding over 180 days     16        23    approximately 78 million of casino receivables and 4 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31 2013 the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has decreased in the current year due primarily to strong collections which resulted in a decrease in the aging of accounts at december 31 2013 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by 3 million  fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies  property and equipment are stated at cost for the majority of our property and equipment cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated fair values in connection with the june 2011 mgm china acquisition the april 2005 mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period  we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment in addition our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively  impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets  we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as a held for sale or b to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset for operating assets fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are    62     discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses  there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates  on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results negative industry or economic factors significant changes to our operating environment or changes in intended use of the asset group we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group including potential sale historically undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin  we review indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach and trademarks which are tested for impairment using the relieffromroyalty method goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group with the exception of the impairment of goodwill attributed to railroad pass in 2011 none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2013 2012 or 2011 as of the date we completed our 2013 goodwill impairment analysis the estimated fair values of our reporting units with associated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying values as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge  there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the determination of capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions  see operating results  details of certain charges for further discussion of write downs and impairments of longlived assets  impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates  we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in value if such conditions exist we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is otherthantemporary based on our assessment of relevant factors including consideration of our intent and ability to retain    63     our investment we estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates and a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group see operating results  details of certain charges for discussion of otherthantemporary impairment charges  income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied given the negative impact of the us economy on the results of operations in the past several years we no longer rely on future domestic operating income in assessing the realizability of our domestic deferred tax assets and now rely only on the future reversal of existing domestic taxable temporary differences as of december 31 2013 the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal deductible temporary differences exceeds the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal taxable temporary differences and we provide a valuation allowance for this excess at december 31 2013 such valuation allowance was 165 billion in addition there is a 16 million valuation allowance after federal effect provided on certain state deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of 56 million on certain macau deferred tax assets because we believe these assets do not meet the more likely than not criteria for recognition  our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities  we assess our tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a more likely than not threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current in other accrued liabilities or longterm in other longterm liabilities based on the time until expected payment additionally we recognize accrued interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material  as of december 31 2013 we are no longer subject to examination of our us consolidated federal income tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2005 the irs completed its examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2003 and 2004 tax years during 2010 and we paid 12 million in tax and 4 million in associated interest with respect to adjustments to which we agreed and protested with irs appeals issues to which we did not agree we favorably settled during the first quarter of 2013 all issues on appeal with irs appeals resulting in a refund of 2 million including interest during the fourth quarter of 2010 the irs opened an examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2005 through 2009 tax years the irs completed its examination during 2013 and we have tentatively agreed to all proposed adjustments this agreement is subject to final approval from the joint committee on taxation and the examination will not be considered settled until such approval is received which we anticipate will occur in the next twelve months we deposited 30 million with the irs to cover the expected cash taxes and interest resulting from the tentatively agreed adjustments for this examination and the examinations discussed below  during the first quarter of 2011 the irs opened examinations of the 2007 through 2008 tax years of citycenter holdings llc an unconsolidated affiliate treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and the 2008 through 2009 tax years of mgm grand detroit llc a subsidiary treated as a partnership for income tax purposes the irs completed these examinations in 2013 and we agreed to all proposed adjustments the impact of these adjustments is included in the 30 million deposit described above    64    during the fourth quarter of 2010 we and our joint venture partner reached tentative settlement with irs appeals with respect to the audit of the 2003 and 2004 tax years of a cost method investee of ours that is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes the adjustments to which we agreed in such tentative settlement were included in the final settlement we reached with irs appeals with respect to the 2003 and 2004 examination of our consolidated federal income tax return the irs completed during 2013 its examination of the 2005 through 2009 tax years of this investee and we agreed to all proposed adjustments the impact of these adjustments is included in the 30 million deposit described above  as of december 31 2013 other than adjustments resulting from the federal income tax audits discussed above and the exceptions noted below we were no longer subject to examination of our various state and local tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2009 the state of michigan initiated during the second quarter of 2013 a review of the michigan business tax returns of mgm grand detroit llc for the 2009 through 2011 tax years to determine whether to open an examination of one or more of these years but has not yet indicated whether such an examination will take place during 2010 the state of illinois initiated an audit of our illinois combined returns for the 2006 and 2007 tax years such audit closed in 2012 resulting in an immaterial refund of taxes from such years during 2010 the state of new jersey began audit procedures of a cost method investee of ours for the 2003 through 2006 tax years no other state or local income tax returns are currently under exam  stockbased compensation  we account for stock options and stock appreciation rights sars measuring fair value using the blackscholes model for restricted share units rsus compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant we account for performance stock units psus measuring fair value using the monte carlo valuation model there are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the blackscholes model and monte carlo valuation model our volatility and expected term assumptions used in the blackscholes model can significantly affect the fair value of stock options and sars the monte carlo valuation model also utilizes multiple assumptions including volatility to determine the fair value of the award changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of sharebased compensation and consequently the related amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements the extent of the impact will depend in part on the extent of awards in any given year  market risk  in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations we are also exposed to additional market risks market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions  as of december 31 2013 longterm variable rate borrowings represented approximately 25 of our total borrowings assuming a 100 basispoint increase in libor in the case of term loan b over the 1 floor specified in our senior credit facility our annual interest cost would change by approximately 28 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31 2013 assuming a 100 basispoint increase in hibor for the mgm grand paradise credit facility our annual interest cost would change by approximately 6 million based    65     on amounts outstanding at december 31 2013 the following table provides additional information about our gross longterm debt
