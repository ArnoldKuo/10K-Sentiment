domestic resorts over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn

premium players access to highlimit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere    mgm china on june 3 2011 we and ms ho pansy catilina chiu king ms pansy ho completed a

additional 1 interest of mgm china we obtained a controlling interest and were required to consolidate mgm china as of june 3 2011 prior to the transaction we held a 50 interest in mgm grand paradise sa mgm grand paradise which was accounted for under the equity method we believe our ownership interest in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability asia is the fastestgrowing gaming market in the world and macau is the worlds largest gaming destination in terms of revenue    our current mgm china operations relate to mgm macau and the development of a casino resort on the cotai strip in macau discussed further below revenues at mgm macau are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by mgm grand paradise the macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession was granted by sociedade de jogos de macau sa and expires in 2020 the macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations   in october 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of macau to develop a resort and casino on an approximately 18 acre site in cotai macau mgm cotai the land concession contract became effective when the macau government published the agreement in the official gazette of macau on january 9 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years under the

fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs mgm cotai is anticipated to open in the fall of 2016   customers and competition    our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments we compete against gaming companies as well as other hospitality companies in the markets we operate in neighboring markets and in other parts of the world including nongaming resort destinations such as hawaii our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states and internationally      3    our primary methods of successful competition include          locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets        constructing and maintaining highquality resorts and facilities including luxurious guestrooms stateoftheart convention facilities and premier dining entertainment retail and other amenities        recruiting training and retaining wellqualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service        providing unique mustsee entertainment attractions and        developing distinctive and memorable marketing promotional and customer loyalty programs    wholly owned domestic resorts our customers include premium gaming customers leisure and wholesale travel customers business travelers and group customers including conventions trade associations and small meetings we have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and valueoriented tour and travel customers many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our resorts during midweek and offpeak periods    our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the las vegas area including major hotel casinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotel casinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the strip and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority there were approximately 150500 guestrooms in las vegas at both december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 at december 31 2014 we operated approximately 27 of the guestrooms in las vegas las vegas visitor volume was 411 million in 2014 a 4 increase from the 397 million reported for 2013    outside las vegas our other nevada operations compete with each other and with many other similarly sized and larger operations our nevada resorts located outside of las vegas appeal primarily to the valueoriented leisure traveler and the valueoriented local customer a significant number of our customers at these resorts come from california   outside nevada our resorts primarily compete for customers in local and regional gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region for example in detroit michigan we compete with a casino in nearby windsor canada and with native american casinos in michigan in biloxi mississippi we compete with regional riverboat and landbased casinos in louisiana native american casinos in central mississippi and with casinos in florida and the bahamas   mgm china the three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market are vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip gaming play is sourced both internally and externally externally sourced vip gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who offer vip players various services such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel food and beverage services gaming promoters operate vip gaming rooms within the property in exchange for their services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenuesharing arrangements or rolling chip turnover based commissions inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate these clientele are acquired through our direct marketing efforts unlike gaming promoters and inhouse vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future to target premium main floor players in order to grow revenue and improve yield we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadiumstyle electronic table games terminals which include both table games and slots to the main floor gaming area the amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor players    our key competitors in macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires if the macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows additionally several concessionaires have expansion plans announced or underway primarily located on the cotai strip the properties currently operating in cotai have achieved a higher growth rate than those located on the macau peninsula we expect competition in the macau market to continue to increase as more capacity is brought online in the near future we also encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of asia and around the world including singapore malaysia the philippines australia new zealand las vegas cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region    corporate and other much like our wholly owned resorts our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts aria which we manage and own 50 through citycenter appeals to the upper end of each segment in the las vegas market and competes with our wholly owned casino    4    resorts and other resorts on the las vegas strip our other unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers against casino resorts in their respective markets   marketing    our marketing efforts are conducted through various means including our loyalty programs as discussed further below we advertise on radio television internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the united states and overseas as well as by direct mail email and through the use of social media we also advertise through our regional

adversely affect our development options and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations        current and future economic and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service or refinance our indebtedness and to make planned expenditures and investments        restrictions and limitations in the agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness could significantly affect our ability to operate our business as well as significantly affect our liquidity        significant competition we face with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete        the fact that our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations could adversely affect our business        the impact on our business of economic and market conditions in the markets in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside        restrictions on our ability to have any interest or involvement in gaming business in china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china

an extension of the subconcession which is scheduled to expire on march 31 2020        our ability to build and open our development in cotai by january 2018        the dependence of mgm macau upon gaming promoters for a significant portion of gaming revenues in macau        our ability to recognize our foreign tax credit deferred asset and the variability of the valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred tax asset       extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business        the concentration of a majority of our major gaming resorts on the las vegas strip        the fact that we extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables        the potential occurrence of impairments to goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets which could negatively affect future profits        the susceptibility of leisure and business travel especially travel by air to global geopolitical events such as terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility and to disease epidemics        the fact that coinvesting in properties including our investment in citycenter decreases our ability to manage risk        the fact that future construction or development projects will be susceptible to substantial development and construction risks        the fact that our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future        the fact that citycenter has decided to abate the potential for structural collapse of the harmon hotel amp spa the harmon in the event of a codelevel earthquake by demolishing the building which exposes us to risks in connection with the demolition process        the fact that a failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business        the risks associated with doing business outside of the united states and the impact of any potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or other similar anticorruption laws        risks related to pending claims that have been or future claims that may be brought against us        the fact that a significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements        the sensitivity of our business to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results        the potential that failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and internal customer information could result in damage of reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or other restrictions on our use or transfer of data        increases in gaming taxes and fees in the jurisdictions in which we operate and       the potential for conflicts of interest to arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of mgm china which is now a publicly traded company listed on the hong kong stock exchange   any forwardlooking statement made by us in this form 10k or our 2014 annual

11        item 1a  risk factors   you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows in evaluating us you should consider carefully among other things the risks described below   risks relating to our substantial indebtedness         our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 142 billion principal amount of indebtedness outstanding including 27 billion of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured credit facility we had approximately 11 billion of available borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility as of december 31 2014 any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs in addition as of december 31 2014 mgm grand paradise sa mgm grand paradise the company that owns and operates mgm macau had approximately 553 million of debt outstanding under its credit facility we do not guarantee mgm grand paradises obligations under its credit agreement and to the extent mgm macau were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service its indebtedness our ability to make additional investments into that entity is limited by the covenants in our existing senior secured credit facility in addition our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences including         increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions       limiting our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in our business and industry       limiting our ability to borrow additional funds       making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness or       placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to lessleveraged competitors   moreover our businesses are capital intensive for our owned and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties wellmaintained modernized and refurbished such investment requires an ongoing supply of cash and to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained similarly future development projects including the las vegas arena project and our development projects in massachusetts and maryland and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments the incurrence of additional debt guarantees of thirdparty debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations         current and future economic and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service or refinance our indebtedness and to make planned expenditures our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures and investments depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future our ability to receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries including mgm china and our ability to borrow under our senior secured credit facility to the extent of available borrowings if regional and national economic conditions deteriorate we could experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in consumer spending levels and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations continue to receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries including mgm china or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs    we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2015 including 145 billion of our 425 convertible senior notes due 2015 and thereafter fluctuations in our common stock impact the likelihood of the convertible senior notes being converted into equity if our common stock price is below the conversion price of our convertible senior notes on the date of maturity holders will not convert them into equity and we will be required to repay the principal amount of the convertible securities for cash    our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness in the future will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments there is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us if at all on satisfactory terms on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements   12            the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business as well as significantly affect our liquidity and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations covenants governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict among other things our ability to         pay dividends or distributions repurchase or issue equity prepay certain debt or make certain investments       incur additional debt       incur liens on assets       sell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all assets       enter into transactions with affiliates       allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets and       enter into sale and leaseback transactions   our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness any default under our senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth our financial condition our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt   in addition mgm grand paradise and mgm china are coborrowers under an amended and restated credit facility which contains covenants that restrict their ability to engage in certain transactions in particular the mgm china amended and restated credit facility requires mgm china to satisfy various financial covenants including a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio and imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on mgm china and its subsidiaries including mgm grand paradise which include among other things limitations on its ability to pay dividends or distributions to us incur additional debt make investments or engage in other businesses merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer or sell assets   risks related to our business         we face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow the hotel resort and casino industries are highly competitive we do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area and hotel resort and gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our customers to the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations competition will increase major competitors including new entrants have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity or are currently expanding their capacity or constructing new resorts in las vegas and macau also the growth of gaming in areas outside las vegas including california has increased the competition faced by our operations in las vegas and elsewhere   in addition competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the united states and elsewhere result in the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos such as has happened in california for example while our macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near asia including singapore australia new zealand cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and unlicensed gaming operations certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming including malaysia vietnam cambodia the philippines and russia and others such as japan taiwan and thailand may legalize casino gaming or online gaming in the future furthermore currently mgm grand paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaires open additional facilities for example the facilities currently being developed in cotai macau we would face increased competition furthermore most jurisdictions in which casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical andor geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities which may include acquisitions of existing properties that do arise furthermore certain jurisdictions including nevada and new jersey have also legalized forms of online gaming and the expansion of online gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino resorts     13    in addition to competition with other hotels resorts and casinos we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow         our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries states and provinces in which we operate these laws regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but generally concern the responsibility financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations as such our gaming regulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or alternatively cease operations in that jurisdiction in addition unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions the regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we are subject to various gaming taxes which are subject to possible increase at any time by various state and federal legislatures and officials increases in gaming taxation could also adversely affect our results for a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect our business see regulation and licensing and exhibit 992 to this annual report on form 10k   further our directors officers key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities if state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in the property state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities   in macau current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are for the most part fairly recent and there is little precedent on the interpretation of these laws and regulations these laws and regulations are complex and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations or issue new or modified regulations that differ from mgm chinas interpretation which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations in addition mgm chinas activities in macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies we cannot assure you that mgm china will be able to obtain all necessary approvals and any such failure to do so may materially affect its longterm business strategy and operations macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions however to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues   in addition to gaming regulations we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters smoking employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising for instance we are subject to certain federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances including the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the oil pollution act of 1990 under various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted for example illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places including bars restaurants work places schools and casinos similarly in october 2014 casinos in macau including mgm china implemented a smoking ban which prohibits smoking on all mass market gaming floors and in 2015 the macau health bureau announced that they will promote the submission of a bill proposing a full smoking ban in casinos including in vip rooms in 2015 the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance   in addition we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various antimoney laundering laws and regulations for instance we are subject to regulation under the currency and foreign transactions reporting act of 1970 commonly known as the bank secrecy act which among other things requires us to report to the internal revenue service irs any currency transactions in excess of 10000 that occur within a 24hour gaming day including identification of the individuals involved in the currency transaction we are also required to report certain suspicious activity including any transactions aggregating to 5000 or more where we know suspect or have reason to suspect such transactions among other things involve funds from illegal    14    activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose in addition under the bank secrecy act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting recordkeeping and retention our compliance with the bank secrecy act is subject to periodic audits by the irs and we may be required to pay substantial penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulations any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted any violations of the antimoney laundering laws including the bank secrecy act or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows         our business is affected by economic and market conditions in the markets in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending on conventions and business development economic contraction economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for hotels casino resorts trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury amenities we offer in addition changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel an unstable job market perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth outbreaks of contagious diseases such as the recent ebola epidemic or fears of war and future acts of terrorism consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors including as a result of demographic changes which for instance has resulted in recent growth in consumer demand for nongaming offerings our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and react to these trends and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations aria bellagio and mgm grand las vegas in particular may be affected by economic conditions in the far east and all of our nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the united states and california in particular a recession economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts which would adversely affect our operating results for example the prior recession and downturn in consumer and corporate spending had a negative impact on our results of operations   in addition since we expect a significant number of customers to come to mgm macau from mainland china general economic and market conditions in china could impact our financial prospects any slowdown in economic growth or changes to chinas current restrictions on travel and currency movements including market impacts resulting from chinas recent anticorruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by nonbank lending entities and crossborder currency monitoring could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china to mgm macau andor the amounts they are willing to spend in the casino for example from 2008 through 2010 china readjusted its visa policy toward macau and limited the number of visits that some mainland chinese citizens may make to macau in a given time period in addition effective october 2013 china banned zerofare tour groups involving no or low upfront payments and compulsory shopping which were popular among visitors to macau from mainland china and in december 2014 the chinese government tightened the enforcement of visa transit rules for those seeking to enter macau at the gongbei border including requirements to present an airplane ticket to a destination country a visa issued by such destination country and a valid chinese passport it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect become more restrictive or be readopted in the future these developments have had and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have the effect of reducing the number of visitors to macau from mainland china which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in macau   furthermore our operations in macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources our success in macau will be impacted by our ability to retain and hire employees we compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of new developments in macau while we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resort certain macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications in addition limitations on the number of gaming tables permitted by the macau government could impact our current expectation on the number of table games we will be able to utilize at our cotai project such limitations or reduction in table game availability may impact mgm chinas results of operations finally because additional casino projects are under construction and are to be developed in the future existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to macau if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau the desirability of macau as a gaming destination as well as the results of operations at our development in cotai macau could be negatively impacted          we have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china in connection with the initial public offering of mgm china the holding company that indirectly owns and operates mgm macau we entered into a deed of noncompete undertakings with mgm china and ms pansy ho pursuant to which we are restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the peoples republic of china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china while gaming is currently    15         prohibited in china hong kong and taiwan if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete in these locations could be limited until the earliest of i march 31 2020 ii the date mgm chinas ordinary shares cease to be listed on the stock exchange of hong kong limited or iii the date when our ownership of mgm china shares is less than 20 of the then issued share capital of mgm china         the macau government can terminate mgm grand paradises subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating mgm grand paradise the macau government can exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession in 2017 or the macau government can refuse to grant mgm grand paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2020 any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the subconcession in the event of fundamental noncompliance by mgm grand paradise with applicable macau laws or mgm grand paradises basic obligations under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such noncompliance with its fundamental obligations under the subconcession contract within a period to be stipulated by the macau government upon such termination all of mgm grand paradises casino area premises and gamingrelated equipment would be transferred automatically to the macau government without compensation to mgm grand paradise and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will perform all of its obligations under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the macau government   furthermore under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the macau government might promulgate in the future we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macau businesses if any disagreement arises between mgm grand paradise and the macau government regarding the interpretation of or mgm grand paradises compliance with a provision of the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the macau government during any consultation or negotiation mgm grand paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the macau government currently there is no precedent concerning how the macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above the loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in macau which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   in addition the subconcession contract expires on march 31 2020 unless the subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended all of mgm grand paradises casino premises and gamingrelated equipment will automatically be transferred to the macau government on that date without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations beginning on april 20 2017 the macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one years prior notice in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right mgm grand paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and nongaming revenue generated by mgm grand paradise excluding the convention and exhibition facilities during the taxable year prior to the redemption before deducting interest depreciation and amortization multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to renew or extend the subconcession contract on terms favorable to mgm grand paradise or at all we also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed the compensation paid to mgm grand paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues         we are required to build and open our development in cotai macau by january 2018 if we are unable to meet this deadline and the deadline for the development is not extended we may lose the land concession which would prohibit us from operating any facilities developed under such land concession the land concession for the approximately 18 acre site on cotai macau was officially gazetted on january 9 2013 if we are unable to build and open our proposed resort and casino by january 2018 and the deadline is not extended the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the land concession contract a loss of the land concession could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows         mgm grand paradise is dependent upon gaming promoters for a significant portion of gaming revenues in macau  gaming promoters who promote gaming and draw highend customers to casinos are responsible for a significant portion of mgm grand paradises gaming revenues in macau with the rise in gaming in macau and the recent reduction in the number of licensed gaming promoters in macau and in the number of vip rooms operated by licensed gaming promoters the competition for relationships with gaming promoters has increased while mgm grand paradise is undertaking initiatives to strengthen relationships with gaming promoters there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain or grow relationships with gaming promoters in addition continued reductions in the gaming promoter segment may result    16         in the closure of additional vip rooms in macau including vip rooms at mgm macau if mgm grand paradise is unable to maintain or grow relationships with gaming promoters or if gaming promoters are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our highend customers mgm grand paradises ability to grow gaming revenues will be hampered furthermore if existing vip rooms at mgm macau are closed there can be no assurance that mgm grand paradise will be able to locate acceptable gaming promoters to run such vip rooms in the future in a timely manner or at all   in addition the quality of gaming promoters is important to mgm grand paradises and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with gaming licenses while mgm grand paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters we cannot assure you that the gaming promoters with whom mgm grand paradise is or becomes associated with will meet the high standards insisted upon if a gaming promoter falls below mgm grand paradises standards mgm grand paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gaming regulators with authority over our operations   we also grant credit lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the recoverability of these loans         the future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred tax asset may change materially in future periods based on changes to the underlying forecasts of future profitability of and distributions from mgm china and changes in our assumption concerning renewals of the fiveyear exemption from macaus 12 complementary tax on gaming profits we currently have significant foreign tax credit deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce potential taxable foreignsourced income in future periods we evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverability and record a valuation allowance to the extent that we determine it is not more likely than not such asset will be recovered this evaluation is based on available evidence including assumptions about future profitability of and distributions from mgm china as well as our assumption concerning renewals of the fiveyear exemption from macaus 12 complementary tax on gaming profits as a result significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of the valuation allowance for example should we in a future period actually receive or be able to assume an additional fiveyear exemption an additional valuation allowance would likely need to be provided on some portion or all of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset resulting in an increase in the provision for income taxes in such period and such increase may be material in addition a change to our forecasts of future profitability of and distributions from mgm china could also result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in such period         extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business which could harm our business and results of operations certain of our casino properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions including but not limited to hurricanes in the united states and severe typhoons in macau such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas in addition our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage a severe drought of extensive duration experienced in las vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adversely affect our business and results of operations although we maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme weather conditions such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect if at all on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions furthermore such extreme weather conditions may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows         because a majority of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified given that a majority of our major resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the las vegas tourism industry for example the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from las vegas can adversely affect our business we cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from las vegas but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand can impact the number of visitors to our resorts additionally there is one principal interstate highway between las vegas and southern california where a large number of our customers reside capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities         we extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables we conduct a portion of our gaming activities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments table    17         games players typically are issued more markers than slot players and highend players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts highend gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming and variances in winloss results attributable to highend gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter furthermore the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these highend customers could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cashflows we issue markers to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant in the opinion of management an extension of credit in addition mgm grand paradise extends credit to certain gaming promoters and those promoters can extend credit to their customers uncollectible receivables from highend customers and gaming promoters could have a significant impact on our results of operations   while gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the us of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from united states courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations   furthermore we expect that mgm macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions including macau to the extent mgm macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions mgm macau may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because among other reasons courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm macau may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts moreover under applicable law mgm macau remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers   even where gaming debts are enforceable they may not be collectible our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results         we may incur impairments to goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets which could negatively affect our future profits we review our goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative guidance significant negative trends reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in writedowns and impairment charges in the past and if one or more of such events occurs in the future additional impairment charges may be required in future periods if we are required to record additional impairment charges this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations         leisure and business travel especially travel by air are particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events such as terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility we are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air since most of our customers travel by air to our las vegas and macau properties any terrorist act outbreak of hostilities escalation of war or any actual or perceived threat to the security of travel by air could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows furthermore although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts insurance coverage against loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable         coinvesting in our properties including our investment in citycenter decreases our ability to manage risk in addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly we have from time to time invested and expect to continue to invest as a coinvestor coinvestors often have shared control over the operation of the property therefore the operation of such properties is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters in addition investments with other investors may involve risks such as the possibility that the coinvestor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives consequently actions by a coinvestor might subject hotels and resorts owned by such entities to additional risk further we may be unable to take action without the approval of our coinvestors alternatively our coinvestors could take actions binding on the property without our consent additionally should a coinvestor become bankrupt we could become liable for their share of liabilities   for instance citycenter which is 50 owned and managed by us has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations if citycenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our coinvestor are unable to support future funding requirements as necessary such event could have adverse    18    financial consequences to us in addition the agreements governing citycenters indebtedness subject citycenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness place liens upon assets make distributions to us make certain investments consummate certain asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates including us and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets the citycenter third amended and restated credit facility also includes certain financial covenants that require citycenter to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio as defined in citycenters third amended and restated credit facility for each quarter we cannot be sure that citycenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test   in addition in accordance with the citycenter third amended and restated credit facility we provided a cost overrun guarantee which is secured by our interests in the assets of circus circus las vegas and certain adjacent land         any of our future construction or development projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks which could have a material adverse impact on related project timetables costs and our ability to complete the projects   any of our future construction or development projects will be subject to a number of risks including         lack of sufficient or delays in the availability of financing       changes to plans and specifications       engineering problems including defective plans and specifications       shortages of and price increases in energy materials and skilled and unskilled labor and inflation in key supply markets       delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals       changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations applicable to gaming leisure residential real estate development or construction projects       labor disputes or work stoppages       disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors       personal injuries to workers and other persons       environmental health and safety issues including site accidents and the spread of viruses       weather interferences or delays       fires typhoons and other natural disasters       geological construction excavation regulatory and equipment problems and       other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases   the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs delay or prevent the construction development or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future construction projects which we might undertake for instance we currently expect the total development costs of our cotai project to be approximately 29 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs we currently expect total development costs of our maryland project to be approximately 12 billion total development costs of our massachusetts project to be approximately 760 million and total development costs of our las vegas arena project to be approximately 350 million each excluding capitalized interest and land related costs while we believe that the overall budgets for these developments are reasonable these development costs are estimates and the actual development costs may be higher than expected we cannot guarantee that our construction costs or total project costs for future projects including our developments in cotai maryland and massachusetts will not increase beyond amounts initially budgeted in addition the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines and any such deadlines are not extended we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition         our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer in addition our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future although we have all risk property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss such as fire natural disasters acts of war or terrorism each policy has certain exclusions in addition our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty in addition certain casualty events such as labor strikes nuclear events acts of war loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism loss of electrical power due to catastrophic events rolling blackouts or otherwise deterioration or corrosion insect or animal damage and pollution may not be covered at all under our policies therefore certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses   19      in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event    we renew our insurance policies other than our builders risk insurance on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits further increase our deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage         citycenter has decided to abate the potential for structural collapse of the harmon in the event of a codelevel earthquake by demolishing the building and we are exposed to risks in connection with the demolition process after partial construction of the harmon citycenter discovered that in certain elements of the building known as link beams the reinforcing steel had been installed incorrectly by citycenters general contractor perini building company perini and its subcontractors after additional structural defects in other areas of the harmon were discovered further construction at the harmon was indefinitely stopped during the third quarter of 2010 citycenter determined that the harmon was unlikely to be completed using the existing partially completed structure as it now stands in response to a request by the clark county building division the building division citycenter engaged an engineer to conduct an analysis based on all available information as to the structural stability of the harmon under buildingcodespecified load combinations on july 11 2011 that engineer submitted the results of his analysis of the harmon tower and podium in its current asbuilt condition the engineer opined among other things that in a codelevel earthquake using either the permitted or current code specified loads it is likely that critical structural members in the tower will fail and become incapable of supporting gravity loads leading to a partial or complete collapse of the tower there is missing or misplaced reinforcing steel in columns beams shear walls and transfer walls throughout the structure of the tower below the twentyfirst floor based on this engineering opinion the building division requested a plan of action from citycenter citycenter informed the building division that it decided to abate the potential for structural collapse of the harmon in the event of a codelevel earthquake by demolishing the building subject to the receipt of court approval on august 23 2013 the court granted citycenters motion and citycenter commenced planning for demolition of the building on january 31 2014 the court revoked its prior authorization of demolition of the harmon without prejudice to renewal of the application on the grounds that citycenters nonparty builders risk insurer requested further testing in the building that request for further testing was withdrawn pursuant to the insurers settlement of citycenters harmon 2008 policy claim on april 22 2014 the court granted citycenters renewed application for permission to demolish the harmon the clark county building department issued the necessary permits required for demolition of this building citycenter is in the process of a controlled deconstruction of the harmon structure in accordance with the standards set by its expert consultants and the clark county building department a partial or complete collapse of the harmon prior to demolition or the demolition process itself could result in property damage or injury which could have a material adverse effect on citycenters and our business andor cause reputational harm to citycenter and us          any failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business the development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success while our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one trademark or combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual property we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations through the use of trademarks we file applications for and obtain trademarks in the united states and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights parties may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource we cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the united states and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others the unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance competitive advantages or goodwill which could adversely affect our business         tracinda owns a significant amount of our common stock and may be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval as of december 31 2014 tracinda corporation beneficially owned approximately 19 of our outstanding common stock as a result tracinda may be able to exercise significant influence over any matter requiring stockholder approval including the approval of significant corporate transactions         we are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states  our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under nonunited states laws regulations and customs    20         in particular the risks associated with the operation of mgm macau or any future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories include         changes in laws and policies that govern operations of companies in macau or other foreign jurisdictions       changes in nonunited states government programs       possible failure to comply with antibribery laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions       general economic conditions and policies in china including restrictions on travel and currency movements       difficulty in establishing staffing and managing nonunited states operations       different labor regulations       changes in environmental health and safety laws       potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws       political instability and actual or anticipated military and political conflicts       economic instability and inflation recession or interest rate fluctuations and       uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures   these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition   we are also exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates if the united states dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries our united states dollar reported income from sources where revenue is dominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease         any violation of the foreign corrupt practices act or any other similar anticorruption laws could have a negative impact on us a significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the united states which exposes us to complex foreign and us regulations inherent in doing crossborder business and in each of the countries in which we transact business we are subject to compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other similar anticorruption laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics violations of these laws by us or our noncontrolled ventures may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties against us and the sec and us department of justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the fcpa the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations         we face risks related to pending claims that have been or future claims that may be brought against us claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries in various legal proceedings and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time we may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business financial condition and results of operations please see the further discussion in legal proceedings and note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements          a significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect our business and results of operations as of december 31 2014 approximately 30800 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements a prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could have an adverse impact on our operations also wage andor benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition to the extent that our nonunion employees join unions we would have greater exposure to risks associated with labor problems         our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results  we are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and therefore higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations accordingly increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results additionally higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues         the failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and internal customer information could result in damage of reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data we collect information relating to our guests for various business purposes including marketing and promotional purposes the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the united states and other    21         jurisdictions around the world privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another   compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs andor adversely impact our ability to market our products properties and services to our guests in addition noncompliance with applicable privacy regulations by us or in some circumstances noncompliance by third parties engaged by us or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage of reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data   we also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of our computer systems through cyberattacks or otherwise could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations for instance there has been an increase in criminal cyber security attacks against companies where customer and company information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed our information systems and records including those we maintain with our thirdparty service providers may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future in addition our thirdparty information system service providers face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours and we do not directly control any of such parties information security operations a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a thirdparty service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation cause a material disruption to our operations and management team and result in remediation expenses regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows         we may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets any of which may be unsuccessful we intend to consider strategic and complementary investments in other businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with third parties investments in businesses properties or assets as well as these alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to         spending cash and incurring debt       assuming contingent liabilities       contributing properties or related assets to hospitality ventures that could result in recognition of losses or       creating additional expenses   we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from such investments or alliances         if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees our results could be adversely affected  state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities from time to time legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws affecting the gaming industry periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase gaming taxes or fees depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected for instance income generated from gaming operations of mgm grand paradise currently has the benefit of a corporate tax exemption in macau which exempts us from paying the 12 complimentary tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games this exemption is effective through the end of 2016 and we believe that we will be granted additional fiveyear exemptions in the future however we cannot assure you that any extensions of the tax exemption will be granted         conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of mgm china the holding company for mgm grand paradise which owns and operates mgm macau as a result of the initial public offering of shares of mgm china common stock mgm china now has stockholders who are not affiliated with us and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers andor directors of mgm china may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of mgm china decisions that could have different implications for us and mgm china including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with mgm china may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest        item 1b   unresolved staff comments    none    22        item 2

proceedings    citycenter construction litigation in march 2010 perini building company inc perini general contractor for citycenter filed a lawsuit in the eighth judicial district court for clark county state of nevada against mgm mirage design group a wholly owned subsidiary of the company which was the original party to the perini construction agreement and certain direct or indirect subsidiaries of citycenter holdings llc the citycenter owners perini asserted among other things that citycenter was substantially completed but the defendants failed to pay perini approximately 490 million allegedly due and owing under the construction agreement for labor equipment and materials expended on citycenter   in april 2010 perini served an amended complaint in this case which joined as defendants many owners of citycenter residential condominium units the condo owner defendants added a count for foreclosure of perinis recorded master mechanics lien against the citycenter property in the amount of approximately 491 million and asserted the priority of this mechanics lien over the interests of the citycenter owners the condo owner defendants and citycenter lenders in the citycenter property in november 2012 perini filed a second amended complaint which among other things added claims against the citycenter defendants of breach of contract alleging that citycenters owner controlled insurance program ocip failed to provide adequate project insurance for perini with broad coverages and high limits and tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing alleging improper administration by citycenter of the ocip and builders risk insurance programs prior to the final settlement as defined below citycenter settled the claims of 219 firsttier perini subcontractors including the claims of any lowertier    24    subcontractors that might have claims through those firsttier subcontractors as a result of these settlement agreements and the prior settlement agreements between perini and citycenter most but not all of the components of perinis nonharmonrelated lien claim against citycenter were resolved on february 24 2014 perini filed a revised lien for 174 million as the amount claimed by perini and the remaining harmonrelated subcontractors   during 2013 citycenter reached a settlement agreement with certain professional service providers against whom it had asserted claims in this litigation for errors or omissions with respect to the citycenter project and relevant insurers this settlement was approved by the court and citycenter received proceeds of 38 million in 2014 related to both the harmon and other components of the citycenter project   in 2014 citycenter reached a settlement with builders risk insurers of a claim relating to damage alleged at the harmon and received proceeds of 55 million   in december 2014 the perini matter was concluded through a global settlement among the company citycenter perini the remaining subcontractors including those implicated in the harmon work and their affiliates and relevant insurers which followed the previously disclosed settlement agreements and an extrajudicial program for settlement of certain project subcontractor claims this global settlement concluded all outstanding claims in the case the final settlement the effectiveness of the global settlement was made contingent upon citycenters execution of certain indemnity and release agreements which were executed in january 2015 and citycenters procurement of replacement general liability insurance covering construction of the citycenter development which was obtained in january 2015   the final settlement together with previous settlement agreements relating to the nonharmon related lien claims resolved all of perinis and the remaining subcontractors lien claims against citycenter mgm resorts international design formerly known as mgm mirage design group certain direct or indirect subsidiaries of citycenter and the condo owner defendants however citycenter expressly reserved any claims for latent or hidden defects as to any portion of citycenters original construction other than the harmon not known to citycenter at the time of the agreement the company and citycenter entered into the final settlement solely as a compromise and settlement and not in any way as an admission of liability or fault    the key terms of the final settlement included    with respect to its nonharmon lien claims perini waived a specific portion of its lien claim against citycenter which combined with the prior nonharmon agreement and accrued interest resulted in a total citycenter payment to perini of 153 million approximately 14 million of which was paid in december 2014 the total payment to perini was funded by the company under the companys completion guarantee and included the application of approximately 58 million of condominium proceeds that were previously held in escrow by citycenter to fund construction lien claims upon final resolution of the perini litigation   citycenters recovery for its harmon construction defect claims when added to the harmonrelated proceeds from prior insurance settlements of 85 million resulted in gross cash settlement proceeds to citycenter of approximately 191 million of which approximately 18 million was paid by the company under the completion guarantee in february 2015   in conjunction with the final settlement the company and an insurer participating in the ocip resolved their arbitration dispute concerning such insurers claim for payments it made under the ocip general liability coverage for contractor costs incurred in the harmon litigation premium adjustments and certain other costs and expenses the company settled this dispute for 38 million and funded the majority of such amounts under the completion guarantee in january 2015 in addition the settlement requires future payments equivalent to fifty percent of any additional contractor costs paid by such insurer after november 30 2014 in connection with the harmon litigation and claims handling fees which the company does not expect to be significant this agreement also provided for specified reductions in the letters of credit the company posted as collateral to secure the payment of its obligations under the disputed coverage

company members of its board of directors and bank of america corporation bank of america the pontiac general action names members of the companys board of directors and bank of america as defendants plaintiffs in both actions allege that they are company stockholders and that they are each acting on behalf of a class including all other company stockholders in the alternative plaintiff in the pontiac general action alleges that it claims    25    derivatively on behalf of the company plaintiffs in both actions allege that the companys directors breached their fiduciary duties by unjustifiably approving the companys amended and restated credit agreement dated as of december 20 2012 the credit agreement or agreement which contains what plaintiffs call a dead hand proxy put change of control provision plaintiffs in both actions assert that this provision permits bank of america as administrative agent under the credit agreement to declare a default and accelerate payment of all outstanding debt and interest thereunder in the event of a change of control ie replacement of a majority of the directors by an actual or threatened proxy fight or consent solicitation under circumstances specified in the agreement plaintiffs in both actions claim that this provision has a coercive effect on stockholder voting for change on the board of directors and entrenches the companys incumbent directors both complaints further allege that bank of america aided and abetted the defendant directors in their alleged breach of fiduciary duties the pontiac general complaint seeks a declaration that demands the board of directors to invalidate the challenged change of control provision would be futile both complaints seek a declaratory judgment that the companys directors breached their fiduciary duties that bank of america aided and abetted this breach and that the challenged change of control provision is invalid unenforceable and severable a permanent injunction against enforcement of the challenged provision by bank of america and attorneys fees and other costs    both of these actions were consolidated under the caption in re mgm resorts international

federal and state court against the company and various of its former and current directors and officers alleging federal securities laws violations andor related breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with statements allegedly made by the defendants during the period august 2007 through the date of such lawsuit filings in 2009 the class period in general the lawsuits assert the same or similar allegations including that during the relevant period defendants artificially inflated the companys common stock price by knowingly making materially false and misleading statements and omissions to the investing public about the companys financial statements and condition operations citycenter and the intrinsic value of the companys common stock that these alleged misstatements and omissions thereby enabled certain company insiders to derive personal profit from the sale of company common stock to the public that defendants caused plaintiffs and other shareholders to purchase company common stock at artificially inflated prices and that defendants imprudently implemented a share repurchase program to the detriment of the company the lawsuits seek unspecified compensatory damages restitution and disgorgement of alleged profits andor attorneys fees and costs in amounts to be proven at trial as well as injunctive relief related to corporate governance only two of these

operations    executive overview    our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we believe that we own and invest in several of the premier casino resorts in the world and have continually reinvested in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financings fund capital expenditures and provide excess cash flow for future development we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities   results of operations from our wholly owned domestic resorts for the year ended december 31 2014 improved compared to the prior year as a result of increased casino and noncasino revenues as general economic conditions continued to improve in the las vegas strip market as reported by the las vegas convention and visitors authority the average room rate for the las vegas strip increased 5 in 2014 compared to 2013 while visitation to las vegas increased 4    in macau gross gaming revenues decreased 3 in 2014 compared to 2013 negatively affected by economic conditions and certain political initiatives in china stricter enforcement of entrance into macau via the use of transit visas as well as a decrease in duration of stay permitted for transit visa holders and the implementation of a full main floor casino smoking ban in october 2014 the decrease in gross gaming revenues accelerated during the second half of 2014 as macau has become an increasingly challenging and competitive market and has impacted primarily vip casino gaming operations however despite concerns over the recent events and the sustainability of economic growth in china we expect the macau market to continue to grow on a longterm basis as the result of a large and growing asian middle class and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within macau according to statistics published by the statistics and census service of the macau government visitor arrivals were 32 million in 2014 an 8 increase compared to 2013   our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities in macau we plan to spend approximately 29 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs to develop a resort and casino featuring approximately 1500 hotel rooms 500 gaming tables and 1500 slots built on an approximately 18 acre site in cotai macau mgm cotai mgm cotai is anticipated to open in the fall of 2016    we were awarded the sixth and final casino license under current statutes in the state of maryland by the maryland video lottery facility location commission to build and operate mgm national harbor a destination resort casino in prince georges county at national harbor we currently expect the cost to develop and construct mgm national harbor to be approximately 12 billion excluding capitalized interest and land related costs we expect that the resort will include a casino with approximately 3600 slots and 160 table games including poker a 300 suite hotel with luxury spa and rooftop pool 79000 square feet of high end branded retail and fine and casual dining a dedicated 3000

we were awarded the category one casino license in region b western massachusetts one of three licensing regions designated by legislation to build and operate mgm springfield mgm springfield will be developed on approximately 145 acres of land between union and state streets and columbus avenue and main street in springfield massachusetts we currently expect the cost to develop and construct mgm springfield to be approximately 760 million excluding capitalized interest and land related costs we expect the resort will include a casino with approximately 3000 slots and 100 table games including poker 250 hotel rooms 64000 square feet of retail and restaurant space 33000 square feet of meeting and event space and a 3500 space parking garage construction of mgm springfield is expected to be

operate the las vegas arena which will be located on a parcel of our land between frank sinatra drive and new yorknew york adjacent to the las vegas strip we and aeg each own 50 of las vegas arena

estimated to cost approximately 350 million excluding capitalized interest and land related costs in september 2014 a wholly owned subsidiary of las vegas arena company entered into a 200 million senior secured credit facility to finance construction of the las vegas arena     31    reportable segments    we have two reportable segments that are based on the regions in which we operate wholly owned domestic resorts and mgm china we currently operate 15 wholly owned resorts in the united states mgm chinas operations consist of the mgm macau resort and casino mgm macau and the development of a casino resort in cotai we have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates our mgm hakkasan hospitality operations and certain other corporate and management operations citycenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate which we also manage for a fee our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as corporate and other operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results    wholly owned domestic resorts at december 31 2014 our wholly owned domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts        las vegas nevada     bellagio mgm grand las vegas including the signature mandalay bay including delano and four seasons the mirage luxor new yorknew york excalibur monte carlo and circus circus las vegas    other     mgm grand detroit in detroit michigan beau rivage in biloxi mississippi gold strike tunica in tunica mississippi circus circus reno in reno nevada gold strike in jean nevada and railroad pass in henderson nevada     over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customer groups and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities also we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts in las vegas nevada which exposes us to certain risks such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts and from the expansion of gaming in the united states generally    key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts are          gaming revenue indicators table games drop and slots handle volume indicators win or hold percentage which is not fully controllable by us our normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 18 to 22 of table games drop and our normal slots hold percentage is in the range of 80 to 85 of slots handle and         hotel revenue indicators hotel occupancy a volume indicator average daily rate adr a price indicator and revenue per available room revpar a summary measure of hotel results combining adr and occupancy rate our calculation of adr which is the average price of occupied rooms per day includes the impact of complimentary rooms complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or cash rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis particularly to casino customers includes a disproportionate suite component the composite adr including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the adr for cash rooms reflecting the higher retail value of suites    mgm china we own 51 and have a controlling interest in mgm china which owns mgm grand paradise the macau company that owns the mgm macau and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions and is in the process of developing mgm cotai we believe our investment in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability    revenues at mgm macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by inhouse vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through the use of gaming promoters gaming promoters introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau assist these customers with travel arrangements and extend gaming credit to these players in exchange for their services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenuesharing arrangements or rolling chip turnover based commissions inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate mgm macau main floor operations primarily consist of walkin and day trip visitors unlike gaming promoters and inhouse vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds    32    the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future   vip gaming at mgm macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips from mgm macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players the nonnegotiable chips allow mgm macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters clients in order to determine vip gaming play gaming promoter commissions are based on either a percentage of actual win plus a monthly complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the rolling chip turnover their customers generate or a percentage of the rolling chip turnover plus discounted offerings on nongaming amenities the estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to vip customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense inhouse vip commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue    main floor table games wagers at mgm macau are conducted by the use of cash chips in addition to purchasing cash chips at gaming tables main floor customers may also purchase cash chips at the casino cage as a result of recent significant increases in cash chips purchased at the casino cage we now adjust main floor table games drop to include such purchases in order to more meaningfully reflect main floor table games volume and hold percentage mgm macaus main floor normal table games hold percentage as calculated on this basis is in the range of 20 to 28 of table games drop slots hold percentage at mgm macau is in the range of 43 to 53 of slots handle   in addition to the key performance indicators used by our wholly owned domestic resorts mgm macau utilizes turnover which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won by mgm macau calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned turnover provides a basis for measuring vip casino win percentage win for vip gaming operations at mgm macau is in the range of 27 to 30 of turnover    corporate and other corporate and other includes our investments in

in 2013 as a result of remeasuring net deferred tax liabilities in macau the effective tax rate increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to tax expense resulting from remeasuring the macau net

from audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitation the    38    income tax benefit on pretax loss in 2012 was substantially below the 35 statutory rate due primarily to the fact that we

income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses and property transactions net adjusted property ebitda is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the mgm resorts stock option plan which is not allocated to each property mgm china recognizes stock compensation expense related to its stock compensation plan which is included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for mgm china adjusted ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes these measures are 1 widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industry and 2 a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies   we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects property transactions net includes normal recurring disposals gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period in addition capital allocation tax planning financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level therefore we use adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of wholly owned domestic resorts operating performance    adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments taxes and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitda information may calculate adjusted ebitda in a different manner    the following table presents a reconciliation of

covenants the restricted group is limited to annual capital expenditures of 500 million in each year beginning with 2013 with unused amounts in any fiscal year rolling over to the next fiscal year but not any fiscal year thereafter our total restricted group capital expenditures allowable under the senior credit facility for 2014 after giving effect to the unused amount from 2013 was 681 million in addition our senior credit facility limits the restricted groups ability to make investments subject to certain thresholds and other important exceptions the restricted group was within the limit of capital expenditures and other investments for 2014 we believe we have sufficient capacity under these thresholds to fund our planned development activity   the senior credit facility provides for customary events of default including without limitation i payment defaults ii covenant defaults iii crossdefaults to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts iv certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency v judgment defaults in excess of specified amounts vi the failure of any loan document by a significant party to be in full force and effect and such circumstance in the reasonable judgment of the required lenders is materially adverse to the lenders or vii the security documents cease to create a valid and perfected first priority lien on any material portion of the collateral in addition the senior secured credit facility provides that a cessation of business due to revocation suspension or loss of any gaming license affecting a specified amount of its revenues or assets will constitute an event of default    all of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our material domestic subsidiaries other than mgm grand detroit llc which is a

may from time to time in our sole discretion purchase repay redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions by tender offer or otherwise pursuant to authorization of our board of directors    at december 31 2014 the mgm grand paradise credit facility consisted of approximately 550 million of term loans and a 145 billion revolving credit facility due october 2017 the outstanding balance at december 31 2014 of 553 million was comprised solely of term loans the interest rate on the facility fluctuates annually based on hibor plus a margin which ranges between 175 and 25 based on mgm chinas leverage ratio mgm china is a joint and several coborrower with mgm grand paradise the mgm grand paradise credit facility is secured by mgm grand paradises interest in the cotai land use right and mgm china mgm grand paradise and their guarantor subsidiaries have granted a security interest in substantially all of their assets to secure the facility the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes and for the development of the cotai project    the mgm grand paradise credit facility agreement contains customary representations and warranties events of default affirmative covenants and negative covenants which impose restrictions on among other things the ability of mgm china and its subsidiaries to make investments pay dividends and sell assets and to incur additional debt and additional liens mgm china is also required to maintain compliance with a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio of 450 to 100 prior to the first anniversary of the mgm cotai opening date and 400 to 100 thereafter and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 250 to 100 mgm china was in compliance with its credit facility

consolidated financial statements for further discussion     4  approximately 26 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and other tax liabilities are excluded from the table as we cannot reasonably estimate when examination and other activity related to these amounts will conclude or when these amounts will be paid if ever      5  we estimate that we will be required to fund approximately 149 million under the citycenter completion guarantee      6  the amount for 2015 includes 242 million related to employment agreements 94 million for entertainment agreements 73 million of open purchase orders and 50 million for required arena equity contributions other commitments include various contracted amounts including information technology advertising maintenance and other service agreements our largest entertainment commitments consist of minimum contractual payments to cirque du soleil which performs shows at several of our resorts our contractual commitments for these shows generally do not exceed 12 months and are based on our ability to exercise certain termination rights however we expect these shows to continue for longer periods    while we have significant indebtedness we believe we have the ability to meet known obligations including principal and interest obligations as well as planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months with existing cash and cash deposits cash flows from operations dividends from mgm china and availability under our senior credit facility we have 24 billion of maturities of longterm debt in 2015

see liquidity and capital resources  other factors affecting liquidity for further discussion of anticipated uses of cash    critical accounting policies and estimates    managements discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates however by their nature judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates    46      allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable    marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts in addition mgm china extends credit to certain inhouse vip gaming customers and gaming promoters our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau at december 31 2014 and 2013 approximately 30 and 31 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states at december 31 2014 and 2013 approximately 54 and 57 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability among other factors when we issue credit to customers who are not residents of the united states    we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customers financial condition collection history and any other known information    in addition to enforceability issues the collectibility of unpaid markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a regions economy occur    the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables                 december 31                2014        2013                in thousands

million and 4 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has increased in the current year due to an increase in the aging of accounts at december 31 2014 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by 3 million    fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies    property and equipment are stated at cost for the majority of our property and equipment cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated fair values in connection with the june 2011 mgm china acquisition the april 2005 mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period      47    we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment in addition our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively    impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets    we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset for operating assets fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses see note 4 in the accompanying financial statements for discussion regarding our assets held for sale   there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates    on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results negative industry or economic factors significant changes to our operating environment or changes in intended use of the asset group we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group including potential sale historically undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin    we review indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach and trademarks which are tested for impairment using the relieffromroyalty method goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group none of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2014 2013 or 2012 as of the date we completed our 2014 goodwill impairment analysis the estimated fair values of our reporting units with associated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying values as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge    there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the determination of capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions    see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of write downs and impairments of longlived assets      48    impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates    we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in value if such conditions exist we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is otherthantemporary based on our assessment of relevant factors including consideration of our intent and ability to retain our investment we estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group see note 6 and note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of otherthantemporary impairment charges    income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied as of december 31 2014 the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal taxable temporary differences exceeds the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal deductible temporary differences consequently we no longer apply a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets other than our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset as of december 31 2014 we have a foreign tax credit carryover of 26 billion and we have recorded a valuation allowance of 25 billion against this deferred tax asset based upon our assessment of future realization the foreign tax credits are attributable to the macau special gaming tax which is 35 of gross gaming revenue in macau because mgm china is presently exempt from the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits we believe that payment of the macau special gaming tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against us taxes as long as the exemption from macaus 12 complementary tax on gaming profits continues we expect that we will generate excess foreign tax credits on an annual basis and that none of the excess foreign credits will be utilized until the exemption expires although mgm chinas current fiveyear exemption from the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits ends on december 31 2016 we believe it will be entitled to receive a third fiveyear exemption from macau based upon exemptions granted to its competitors in order to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment among gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires for all periods beyond december 31 2021 we have assumed that mgm china will be paying the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits and will thus not be able to credit the macau special gaming tax in such years and have factored that assumption into our assessment of the realization of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset furthermore we do not rely on future us source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization due to our history of recent losses in the us and therefore only rely on us federal taxable temporary differences that we expect will reverse during the 10year foreign tax credit carryover period our assessment of realization of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is based on available evidence including assumptions about future profitability of and distributions from mgm china as well as our assumption concerning renewals of the five year exemption from macaus 12 complementary tax on gaming profits as a result significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of the valuation allowance for example should we in a future period actually receive or be able to assume an additional five year exemption an additional valuation allowance would likely need to be provided on some portion or all of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset resulting in an increase in the provision for income taxes in such period and such increase may be material in addition a change to our forecasts of future profitability of and distributions from mgm china could also result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in such period  in addition there is a 15 million valuation allowance after federal effect provided on certain state deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of 60 million on certain macau deferred tax assets because we believe these assets do not meet the more likely than not criteria for recognition  we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities see note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities we assess our tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a more likely than not threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current in other accrued liabilities or longterm in other longterm liabilities    49    based on the time until expected payment additionally we recognize accrued interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense  stockbased compensation    we account for stock options and stock appreciation rights sars measuring fair value using the blackscholes model for restricted share units rsus compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant we account for performance stock units psus measuring fair value using the monte carlo valuation model there are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the blackscholes model and monte carlo valuation model our volatility and expected term assumptions used in the blackscholes model can significantly affect the fair value of stock options and sars the monte carlo valuation model also utilizes multiple assumptions including volatility to determine the fair value of the award changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of sharebased compensation and consequently the related amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements the extent of the impact will depend in part on the extent of awards in any given year    market risk    in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations we are also exposed to additional market risks market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions    as of december 31 2014 longterm variable rate borrowings represented approximately 23 of our total borrowings assuming a 100 basispoint increase in libor in the case of term loan b over the 1 floor specified in our senior credit facility our annual interest cost would change by approximately 27 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31 2014 assuming a 100 basispoint increase in hibor for the mgm grand paradise credit facility our annual interest cost would change by approximately 6 million based on amounts outstanding at december 31 2014 the following table provides additional information about our gross longterm debt subject to changes in interest rates                                                                                                  fair value             debt maturing in        december 31

31                   in addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates mainly related to mgm china and to our operations at mgm macau and the development of mgm cotai while recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the united states macau or hong kong could cause variability in these exchange rates as of december 31 2014 a 1 increase in the hong kong dollar the functional currency of mgm china to the us dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cash balance by 5 million and a 1 decrease in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt

such receivables    accounts receivable are typically noninterest bearing and are initially recorded at cost accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the companys receivables to their net carrying amount which    71    approximates fair value the allowance is estimated based on specific review of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions management believes that as of december 31 2014 no significant concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been recorded    inventories inventories consist primarily of food and

management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets held for sale the company recognizes the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs to sell as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used the company reviews for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist the company then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset typically measured using a discounted cash flow model if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses see note 15 for information on recorded impairment charges    capitalized

if such conditions exist the company compares the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine if an impairment is indicated and determines whether the impairment is otherthantemporary based on its assessment of all relevant factors including consideration of the companys intent and ability to retain its investment the company estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates and a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the companys peer group see note 6 for results of the companys review of its investment in certain of its unconsolidated affiliates    special

result of the annual impairment review for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in 2014 2013 and 2012    goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated future results of the companys reporting units discounted using market discount rates and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates and a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the companys peer group the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities and the amount remaining if any is the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value then it must be written down to its implied fair value license rights are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach and trademarks are tested for impairment using the relieffromroyalty method if the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount an

mgm grand paradise which is wholly owned by mgm china is exempted from macaus 12 complementary tax for the fiveyear period ending december 31 2016 pursuant to approval from the macau government granted on september 22 2011 absent this exemption net loss attributable to mgm resorts international would have increased by 47 million and 43 million for 2014 and 2013 respectively and net loss per share diluted would have increased by 010 and 009 for 2014 and 2013 respectively the approval granted in 2011 represented the second fiveyear exemption period granted to mgm grand paradise the company measures the net deferred tax liability of mgm grand paradise under the assumption that it will receive an additional fiveyear exemption beyond 2016 such assumption is based upon the granting of a third fiveyear exemption to a competitor of mgm grand paradise the company believes mgm grand paradise should also be entitled to a third fiveyear exemption in order to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment among gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires a requirement under macanese law the net deferred tax liability of mgm grand paradise was remeasured during the first quarter of 2013 due to the extension of the amortization period of the macau gaming subconcession in connection with the effectiveness of the cotai land concession this resulted in an increase in the net deferred tax liability and a corresponding increase in provision for income taxes of 65 million in 2013    nongaming operations remain subject to the macau complementary tax mgm grand paradise had at december 31 2014 a complementary tax net operating loss carryforward of 493 million resulting from nongaming operations that will expire if not utilized against nongaming income in years 2015 through 2017 the macanese net operating loss carryforwards are fully offset by a valuation allowance      87    mgm grand paradises exemption from the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits does not apply to dividend distributions of such profits to mgm china however mgm grand paradise has entered into an agreement with the macau government to settle the 12 complementary tax that would otherwise be due by its shareholder mgm china on distributions of its gaming profits by paying a flat annual payment annual fee arrangement regardless of the amount of distributable dividends such annual fee arrangement is effective until december 31 2016 mgm china is not subject to the complementary tax on distributions it receives during the covered period as a result of the annual fee arrangement annual payments of 2 million are required under the annual fee arrangement the 2 million annual payment for 2014 and 2013 was accrued and a corresponding provision for income taxes was recorded in each year   the company repatriated 390 and 312 million of foreign earnings and profits in 2014 and 2013 respectively at december 31 2014 there are approximately 270 million of unrepatriated foreign earnings and profits all of which the company anticipates will be repatriated without the incurrence of additional us income tax expense accordingly no deferred tax liability has been recorded for those earnings creditable foreign taxes associated with the repatriated earnings and profits increased the companys foreign tax credit carryover by 813 million and 976 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively such foreign taxes consist of the macau special gaming tax which the company believes qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against us income taxes the foreign tax credit carryovers expire as follows 2 million in 2015 785 million in 2022 976 million in 2023 and 813 million in 2024 the foreign tax credit carryovers are subject to valuation allowance as described further below   the company has an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of 23 million that will not expire and a general business tax credit carryforward of 2 million that will begin to expire in 2034    for state income tax purposes the company has illinois and new jersey net operating loss carryforwards of 82 million and 231 million respectively which equates to deferred tax assets after federal tax effect and before valuation allowance of 4 million and 13 million respectively the illinois net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2021 through 2026 the new jersey net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2015 through 2034    as of december 31 2014 the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal taxable temporary differences exceeds the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal deductible temporary differences consequently the company no longer applies a valuation allowance against its domestic deferred tax assets other than the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset the company has recorded a valuation allowance of 25 billion against the 26 billion foreign tax credit deferred tax asset at december 31 2014 in addition there is a 15 million valuation allowance after federal effect provided on certain state deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of 60 million on certain macau deferred tax assets because the company believes these assets do not meet the more likely than not criteria for recognition    the foreign tax credits are attributable to the macau special gaming tax which is 35 of gross gaming revenue in macau because mgm grand paradise is presently exempt from the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits the company believes that payment of the macau special gaming tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against us taxes as long as the exemption from macaus 12 complementary tax on gaming profits continues the company expects that it will generate excess foreign tax credits on an annual basis and that none of the excess foreign credits will be utilized until the exemption expires although mgm grand paradises current fiveyear exemption from the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits ends on december 31 2016 the company assumes that it will receive an additional fiveyear exemption beyond 2016 consistent with the assumption utilized for measurement of the net deferred tax liability of mgm grand paradise for all periods beyond december 31 2021 the company has assumed that mgm grand paradise will be paying the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits and will thus not be able to credit the macau special gaming tax in such years and have factored that assumption into its assessment of the realization of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset furthermore the company does not rely on future us source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization due to its history of recent losses in the us and therefore only relies on us federal taxable temporary differences that it expects will reverse during the 10year foreign tax credit carryover period   the company assesses its tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a more likely than not threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities recorded as a result of this analysis must generally be recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and at december 31 2014 the company has classified 26 million as longterm in other longterm obligations based on the time until expected payment     88    a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows              year ended december 31             2014        2013        2012             in thousands       gross unrecognized tax

would affect the effective tax rate was 12 million and 32 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively    the company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax

citycenter    in april 2010 perini served an amended complaint in this case which joined as defendants many owners of citycenter residential condominium units the condo owner defendants added a count for foreclosure of perinis recorded master mechanics lien against the citycenter property in the amount of approximately 491 million and asserted the priority of this mechanics lien over the interests of the citycenter owners the condo owner defendants and citycenter lenders in the citycenter property in november 2012 perini filed a second amended complaint which among other things added claims against the citycenter defendants of breach of contract alleging that citycenters owner controlled insurance program ocip failed to provide adequate project insurance for perini with broad coverages and high limits and tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing alleging improper administration by citycenter of the ocip and builders risk insurance programs prior to the

of the citycenter project   in 2014 citycenter reached a settlement with builders risk insurers of a claim relating to damage alleged at the harmon and received proceeds of 55 million   in december 2014 the perini matter was concluded through a global settlement among the company citycenter perini the remaining subcontractors including those implicated in the harmon work and their affiliates and relevant insurers which followed the previously disclosed settlement agreements and an extrajudicial program for settlement of certain project subcontractor claims this global settlement concluded all outstanding claims in the case the final settlement the effectiveness of the global settlement was made contingent upon citycenters execution of certain indemnity and release agreements which were executed in january 2015 and citycenters procurement of replacement general liability insurance covering construction of the citycenter development which was obtained in january 2015   the final settlement together with previous settlement agreements relating to the nonharmon related lien claims resolved all of perinis and the remaining subcontractors lien claims against citycenter mgm

claims for latent or hidden defects as to any portion of citycenters original construction other than the harmon not known to citycenter at the time of the agreement the company and citycenter entered into the final settlement solely as a compromise and settlement and not in any way as an admission of liability or fault    the key terms of the final settlement included    with respect to its nonharmon lien claims perini waived a specific portion of its lien claim against citycenter which combined with the prior nonharmon agreement and accrued interest resulted in a total citycenter payment to perini of 153 million approximately 14 million of which was paid in december 2014 the total payment to perini was funded by the company under the companys completion guarantee and included the application of approximately 58 million of condominium proceeds that were previously held in escrow by citycenter to fund construction lien claims upon final resolution of the perini litigation   citycenters recovery for its harmon construction defect claims when added to the harmonrelated proceeds from prior insurance settlements of 85 million resulted in gross cash settlement proceeds to citycenter of approximately 191 million of which approximately 18 million was paid by the company under the completion guarantee in february 2015   in conjunction with the final settlement the company and an insurer participating in the ocip resolved their arbitration dispute concerning such insurers claim for payments it made under the ocip general liability coverage for contractor costs incurred in the harmon litigation premium adjustments and certain other costs and expenses the company settled this dispute for 38 million and funded the majority of such amounts under the completion guarantee in january 2015 in addition the settlement requires future payments equivalent to fifty percent of any additional contractor costs paid by such insurer after november 30 2014 in connection with the harmon litigation and claims handling fees which the company does not expect to be significant this agreement also provided for specified reductions in the letters of credit the company posted as

liability of 149 million which includes amounts yet to be paid as of december 31 2014 in connection with the resolution of the perini litigation and related settlement agreements discussed above as well as citycenters associated legal costs the companys estimated obligation was offset by the 58 million of condominium proceeds received and held by citycenter as of december 31 2014 the company does not believe it is reasonably possible it will be liable for amounts in excess of what it has accrued under the completion guarantee subsequent to december 31 2014 the company funded 130 million to city center to cover completion guarantee obligations   harmon demolition as discussed above a global settlement was reached in the perinicitycenter litigation in december 2014 which finally
