related to our segments   resort operations    general    our casino resorts offer gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities most of our revenue is essentially cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financings fund capital expenditures and provide excess cash flow for future development we have historically made significant investments in our resorts through the addition of new restaurants entertainment nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities in  1      addition we have made regular capital investments to maintain the quality of our hotel rooms and public spaces   we believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate as discussed above ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests the quality of our resorts and amenities can be measured by our success in winning numerous awards both domestic and globally such as several four and five diamond designations from the american automobile association four and five star designations from mobil travel and forbes travel guide four star awards   our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend gaming customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year while our results do not depend on key individual customers a significant portion of our operating income is generated from highend gaming customers which can cause variability in our results in addition our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a country or region can affect our results   all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of grand victoria which operates 22 hours a day every day of the year at our wholly owned domestic resorts our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we generally have an operating philosophy that favors ownership and management of amenities since guests have direct contact with staff in these areas and we prefer to control all aspects of the guest experience however we do lease space to retail and food and beverage operators particularly for branding opportunities and when capital investment by us is not desirable or feasible we also operate many managed outlets utilizing thirdparty management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants and nightclubs  2        our operating resorts    we have provided certain information below about our

ownership interest of approximately 3 of mgm grand detroit    more detailed information about each of our operating resorts can be found in exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference   wholly owned domestic resorts over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities our significant convention and meeting facilities allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower  3      leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities we market to different customer segments to manage our hotel occupancy such as targeting large conventions to increase midweek occupancy   our casino operations feature a variety of slots table games and race amp sports book wagering in addition we offer our premium players access to highlimit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere   mgm china on june 3 2011 we and ms ho pansy catilina chiu king ms pansy ho completed a reorganization of the capital structure of mgm china pursuant to which we acquired an additional 1 interest in mgm china and thereby became the owner of 51 of mgm china through the acquisition of the additional 1 interest of mgm china we obtained a controlling interest and were required to consolidate mgm china as of june 3 2011 prior to the transaction we held a 50 interest in mgm grand paradise sa mgm grand paradise which was accounted for under the equity method we believe our ownership interest in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability asia is the fastestgrowing gaming market in the world and macau is the worlds largest gaming destination in terms of revenue and has continued to grow over the past few years despite the global economic downturn   our current mgm china operations relate primarily to the mgm macau resort and casino mgm macau revenues at mgm macau are generated primarily from gaming operations made up of two distinct market segments main floor and highend vip mgm macau main floor operations consist of both table games and slot machines on the main gaming floors for the public which usually consists of walkin and day trip visitors vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by inhouse vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through gaming promoters also known as junket operators which introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau assist these customers with travel arrangements and extend gaming credit to these players   gaming operations at mgm macau are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by mgm grand paradise the macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession was granted by sociedade de jogos de macau sa sjm and expires in 2020 the macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations   on october 18 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of macau to develop a resort and casino on an approximately 178 acre site in cotai macau the land concession contract became effective when the macau government published the agreement in the official gazette of macau on january 9 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years the total land premium payable to the macau government for the land concession contract is approximately 161 million and is composed of a down payment and eight additional semiannual payments in october 2012 mgm china paid approximately 56 million as the initial down payment of the contract premium including interest on the eight semiannual payments mgm china has approximately 118 million remaining payable for the land concession contract in addition mgm grand paradise is required to pay the macau government approximately 269000 per year in rent during the course of development of the land and approximately 681000 per year in rent once the development is completed the annual rent is subject to review by the macau government every five years under the terms of the land concession contract mgm grand paradise is required to complete the development of the land by january 2018  4        customers and competition    our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments we compete against gaming companies as well as other hospitality companies in the markets we operate in neighboring markets and in other parts of the world including nongaming resort destinations such as hawaii and florida our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states and internationally   our primary methods of successful competition include   locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets constructing and maintaining highquality resorts and facilities including luxurious guestrooms stateoftheart convention facilities and premier dining entertainment retail and other amenities recruiting training and retaining wellqualified and motivated employees who provide superior and friendly customer service providing unique mustsee entertainment attractions and developing distinctive and memorable marketing promotional and customer loyalty programs    wholly owned domestic resorts our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the las vegas area including major hotel casinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotel casinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the strip and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority there were approximately 150500 guestrooms in las vegas at december 31 2012 and 150000 at december 31 2011 at december 31 2012 we operated approximately 27 of the guestrooms in las vegas las vegas visitor volume was 397 million in 2012 a 2 increase from the 389 million reported for 2011   the las vegas market includes leisure travel customers premium gaming customers convention customers including small meetings trade associations and corporate incentive programs and tour and travel customers our luxury wholly owned resorts including bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage appeal to the upper end of each market segment balancing their business by using the convention and tour and travel segments to fill the midweek and offpeak periods our marketing strategy for new yorknew york luxor and monte carlo is aimed at attracting middle to uppermiddleincome customers largely from the leisure travel and the tour and travel segments excalibur and circus circus las vegas generally cater to the valueoriented and middleincome leisure travel and tour and travel segments   outside las vegas our other nevada operations compete with each other and with many other similarly sized and larger operations our nevada resorts located outside of las vegas appeal primarily to the valueoriented leisure traveler and the valueoriented local customer a significant number of our customers at these resorts come from california   outside nevada our resorts primarily compete for customers in local and regional gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region for example in detroit michigan we compete with a casino in nearby windsor canada and with native american casinos in michigan in biloxi mississippi we compete with regional riverboat and landbased casinos in louisiana native american casinos in central mississippi and with casinos in florida and the bahamas   mgm china our key competitors in macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires if the macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we also encounter competition from major gaming centers located in  5      other areas of asia and around the world including singapore malaysia australia las vegas cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region   the two primary customer segments in the macau gaming market are vip and main floor vip gaming play is sourced both internally and externally externally sourced vip gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who offer vip players various services such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel food and beverage services external gaming promoters operate vip gaming rooms within the property we typically pay commissions to external gaming promoters based on gaming wins or losses we extend credit and provide complimentaries to our internally sourced vip clientele without the use of an intermediary these clientele are acquired through our direct marketing efforts   historically gaming operators in macau have mainly focused on vip players but we have increased our focus on the main floor segment the main floor segment includes both table games and slot machines played on the main gaming floors consisting mainly of walkin and daytrip visitors the main floor segment is the highest margin sector of the overall gaming market and exceeds the vip segment due to the latters commission costs to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we expect a larger portion of mgm macaus gaming revenues to come from the main floor segment in future periods   corporate and other aria which we manage and own 50 through the citycenter joint venture appeals to the upper end of each segment in the las vegas market and competes with our wholly owned luxury casino resorts and other luxury resorts on the las vegas strip our other unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers against casino resorts in their respective markets much like our wholly owned resorts our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts    marketing    our marketing efforts are conducted through various means including our loyalty programs as discussed further below we advertise on the radio television internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the united states and overseas as well as by direct mail and through the use of social media we also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major us and foreign cities a key element of marketing to premium gaming customers is personal contact by our marketing personnel direct marketing is also important in the convention segment we maintain websites to inform customers about our resorts and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms make restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets we actively utilize several social media sites to promote our brands unique events and special deals   wholly owned domestic resorts we introduced our loyalty program m life in 2010 m life is a

invite our premium gaming customers to play shadow creek on a complimentary basis additionally marketing efforts at beau rivage benefit from fallen oak golf course located 20 minutes north of beau

vip players brought to the resort through gaming promoters and the inhouse vip marketing team the resort has created a variety of incentive programs to reward gaming promoters for increased business and efficiency    employees and management    we believe that knowledgeable friendly and dedicated employees are a key success factor therefore we invest heavily in recruiting training motivating and retaining exceptional employees and we seek to hire and promote the strongest management team possible we have numerous programs both at the corporate and business unit level designed to achieve these objectives we believe our internal development programs such as the mgm resorts university and various leadership and management training programs are best in class among our industry peers    technology    we utilize various types of technology to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations we continue to move forward on standardizing the technology platforms for several of our key operational systems the standardization of these systems provides us with one consistent operating platform allowing us efficiencies in training reducing complexity in system integration and interfaces standardizing processes across our casino resorts and providing our customers with better information these systems capture charges made by our customers during their stay including allowing customers of our resorts to charge meals and services at our other resorts to their hotel accounts in addition we utilize yield management programs at many of our resorts that help us maximize occupancy and room rates   we continue to roll out our new booking engine which brings together and standardizes our domestic portfolio the booking engine allows our guests and business partners the ability to create an allinclusive experience from accommodations to dining to shows in addition guests will be able to share their vacation plans with others via social media available through all of our domestic resorts individual websites the booking engine gives guests the power to customize a complete itinerary from our full portfolio of experiences all in one place this

beneficial to m life members through full integration with wwwmlifecom with future plans to enable members to redeem express comps members will enjoy powerful benefits including easier access to their customized offers  7        corporate social responsibility    we seek to conduct our business in an effective socially responsible way while striving to maximize shareholder value our corporate social responsibility efforts are overseen by the corporate social responsibility committee of our board of directors   environmental sustainability we continue to gain recognition for our comprehensive environmental responsibility initiatives our resorts in nevada and michigan were the first to earn certification from green key the largest international program evaluating sustainable hotel operations we received certifications at 12 resorts including five green key the highest possible ratings at aria vdara and mandalay bay many major travel service providers recognize the green key designation and identify our resorts for their continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations   in addition we believe that incorporating the tenets of sustainability in our business decisions provides a platform for innovation and operational efficiency citycenter is one of the worlds largest private green developments with six leed gold certifications from the us green building council citycenter serves as a new standard for combining luxury and environmental responsibility within the largescale hospitality industry   we incorporate the same commitment to the environment at mgm macau our efforts to improve energy efficiency indoor air quality and environmental stewardship have resulted in mgm macau receiving the macau environmental protection bureaumacau green hotel award   diversity and inclusion our awardwinning diversity program is designed to identify and develop programs and practices that give sustainable life and momentum to diversity within our company and our suppliers the diversity initiative at our wholly owned domestic resorts focuses on the unique strengths of our individuals combined with a culture of collaborative teamwork to achieve greater performance our diversity program has been widely recognized and has been awarded numerous accolades   philanthropy and community engagement our community and social investments are prioritized to strengthen the communities where our employees live work and care for their families our community platform features three main programs our corporate giving program the employeefunded mgm resorts foundation and our employee volunteer program through these channels we make financial and inkind donations contribute volunteer service and participate in civic and nonprofit organizations that advance the quality of life in our communities key investment areas include basic human needs diversity education and health and wellness    internal controls    we have a strong culture of compliance driven by our history in the highly regulated gaming industry and our belief that compliance is a valueadded activity our system of internal controls and proceduresincluding internal control over financial reportingis designed to promote reliable and accurate financial records transparent disclosures compliance with laws and regulations and protection of our assets our internal controls start at the source of business transactions and we have rigorous enforcement at both the business unit and corporate level   we have a corporate internal audit function that performs regular reviews regarding gaming compliance internal controls over financial reporting and operations in addition we maintain an independent compliance committee that administers our companywide compliance plan the compliance plan is in place to promote compliance with gaming and other laws applicable to our operations in all jurisdictions including performing background investigations on our current and potential employees directors and vendors as well as thorough review of proposed transactions and associations although the corporate internal audit function and the companywide compliance plan are not applicable to mgm china which is a publicly traded subsidiary mgm china has its own internal audit group with similar  8      responsibilities and has established a compliance program at mgm macau that is modeled after our program   in connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our casinos we maintain stringent controls on the recording of all receipts and disbursements and other activities including cash transaction reporting which is essential in our industry our controls surrounding cash transactions include locked cash boxes on the casino floor daily cash counts performed by employees who are independent of casino operations constant observation and supervision of the gaming area observation and recording of gaming and other areas by closedcircuit television constant computer monitoring of our slot machines and timely analysis of deviations from expected performance   marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at our highend resorts our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at certain of those casinos as well we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to timely pay their marker balances these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices direct personal contact and the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation   in our us jurisdictions amounts owed for markers that are not timely paid are enforceable under state laws and all other states are required to enforce a judgment for amounts owed pursuant to the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution amounts owed for markers that are not timely paid are not legally enforceable in some foreign countries but the us assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the us of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from us courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations   furthermore we expect that mgm macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions including macau to the extent mgm macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions mgm macau may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because among other reasons courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm macau may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts moreover under applicable law mgm macau remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers   leveraging our brand and management assets   in allocating resources our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts spending on new resorts or initiatives and repaying longterm debt we believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide profitable returns although these decisions were significantly affected by economic conditions over the past several years when our access to capital was limited   we regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in both the domestic and international markets but cannot at this time determine the likelihood of proceeding with specific development opportunities opportunities we evaluate may include the ownership management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in nevada or in states other than nevada or outside of the united states we leverage our management expertise and wellrecognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities we feel that several of our brands particularly the mgm grand bellagio and skylofts brands are well suited to new projects in both gaming and nongaming developments we may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties  9                  mgm hospitality    mgm hospitality seeks to leverage our management expertise and wellrecognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities mgm hospitality entered into management agreements for hotels in the middle east north africa india and through its joint venture with diaoyutai state guesthouse the peoples republic of china mgm hospitality opened its first resort mgm grand sanya on hainan island the peoples republic of china in early 2012   mgm hospitality and asian coast development ltd acdl previously announced plans to develop mgm grand ho tram in vietnam the project is delayed as acdl has not received certain required government approvals and has experienced a suspension of funding from its lenders mgm hospitality and acdl have entered into an amendment to the management agreement that requires acdl to achieve certain milestones before the project will open and provides a mechanism for the required opening date to be adjusted the required opening date has been adjusted to march 1 2013 if the milestones are not completed by the required opening date mgm hospitality may terminate its agreements with acdl    other    bwinparty in october 2011 we announced a strategic partnership with bwinparty digital entertainment plc the worlds largest publicly traded online poker operator with operations under the partypoker brand although interstate online gambling is currently prohibited in the united states this partnership gives us the ability to offer a secure and regulated online gaming platform to us customers subject to the limitations of applicable federal and state laws and regulations   mashantucket pequot tribal nation we have an agreement with the mashantucket pequot tribal nation mptn which owns and operates foxwoods casino resort in mashantucket connecticut for the casino resort owned and operated by mptn located adjacent to the

others bellagio the mirage mandalay bay mgm mgm grand mgm resorts international luxor excalibur new yorknew york circus circus and beau rivage all of which have been registered or allowed in various classes in the us we are currently undergoing the application process for the mgm resorts international trademark in addition we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in connection with our properties facilities and development projects in the us we have also registered andor applied to register many of our trademarks in various other foreign jurisdictions these

are used and periodically renewed it is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goals for brand development and identification and enforcement of our trademark rights   employees and labor relations   as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 44500 fulltime and 16500 parttime employees domestically of which 5800 and 2700 respectively related to

of mgm macau upon gaming junket operators for a significant portion of gaming revenues in macau extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business   the concentration of our major gaming resorts on the las vegas strip the fact that we extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables the potential occurrence of impairments to goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets which could negatively affect future profits the susceptibility of leisure and business travel especially
