    executive overview   our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we believe that we own and invest in several of the premier casino resorts in the world and have continually reinvested in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financings fund capital expenditures and provide excess cash flow for future development we have historically made significant investments in our resorts through the addition of new restaurants entertainment nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities in addition we have made regular capital investments to maintain the quality of our hotel rooms and public spaces   cash flows generated by our whollyowned domestic resorts in 2012 improved compared to 2011 and 2010 and we expect that trend to continue in 2013 despite continued economic uncertainty visitation to las vegas was up 2 in 2012 and room inventory has peaked with limited new rooms supply planned in the near term   in macau cash flows from operations improved significantly in 2012 led by strong gaming volumes despite continued concerns about economic instability in china and the implementation of new smoking restrictions in macau we expect the macau market to continue to grow in 2012 the pace of growth slowed down but casino revenues for the macau market still grew 14 over 2011 with a significant increase in main floor volumes   our results of operations are also affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital during 2012 we executed a number of transactions which have greatly improved our cost of capital extended our debt maturities and provided capital for future growth projects see principal debt arrangements for further discussion of our debt agreements and related covenants and contractual obligations for debt maturities and interest obligations as of december 31 2012 in 2012 we completed the following transactions   in january we issued 850 million of 8625 senior notes due 2019 for net proceeds of

due 2013 10375 senior secured notes due 2014 11125 senior secured notes due 2017 and 9 senior secured notes due 2020     in addition in february 2013 mgm chinas board of directors declared a special dividend of approximately 500 million which will be paid to shareholders of record as of march 11 2013 and distributed on or about march 18 2013 we will receive approximately 255 million representing 51 of such dividend   while we are focused on continuing to improve our financial position and lower our interest costs we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities in macau we plan to spend approximately 26 billion excluding land and capitalized interest to develop a resort and casino featuring approximately 1600 hotel rooms 500 gaming tables and 2500 slots built on an approximately 178 acre site in cotai macau in addition we have been actively pursuing development opportunities in markets such as maryland massachusetts and toronto    reportable segments    we have two reportable segments that are based on the regions in which we operate wholly owned domestic resorts and mgm china we currently operate 15 wholly owned resorts in the united states mgm chinas operations consist of the mgm macau resort and casino mgm macau and the potential development of a gaming resort in cotai we have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates our mgm hospitality operations and certain other corporate and management operations citycenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate which we also manage for a fee our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as corporate and other operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results   wholly owned domestic resorts at december 31 2012 our wholly owned domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts                las vegas nevada   bellagio mgm grand las vegas including the signature mandalay bay the mirage luxor new yorknew york excalibur monte carlo and circus circus las vegas      other   mgm grand detroit in detroit michigan beau rivage in biloxi mississippi gold strike tunica in tunica mississippi circus circus reno in reno nevada gold strike in jean nevada and railroad pass in henderson nevada      over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities we market to different customer groups to manage our hotel occupancy such as targeting large conventions to increase midweek occupancy as a result of our leveraged business model our operating results are significantly affected by our ability to generate operating revenues also we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts in las vegas nevada which exposes us to certain risks such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts and from the expansion of gaming in the united states generally  38       key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts are   gaming revenue indicators table games drop and slots handle volume indicators win or hold percentage which is not fully controllable by us our normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 19 to 22 of table games drop and our normal slots hold percentage is in the range of 75 to 85 of slots handle and hotel revenue indicators  hotel occupancy a volume indicator average daily rate adr a price indicator and revenue per available room revpar a summary measure of hotel results combining adr and occupancy rate our calculation of adr which is the average price of occupied rooms per day includes the impact of complimentary rooms complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or cash rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis particularly to casino customers includes a disproportionate suite component the composite adr including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the adr for cash rooms reflecting the higher retail value of suites    mgm china on june 3 2011 we and ms ho pansy catilina chiu king ms pansy ho completed a reorganization of the capital structure and the initial public offering of 760 million shares of mgm china on the stock exchange of hong kong limited the ipo representing 20 of the post issuance base capital stock of mgm china at an offer price of hkd 1534 per share pursuant to this reorganization we acquired through a wholly owned subsidiary an additional 1 of the overall capital stock of mgm china for hkd 1534 per share or approximately 75 million and thereby became the owner of 51 of mgm china following the ipo the underwriters exercised their overallotment rights with respect to 59 million shares mgm china owns mgm grand paradise the macau company that owns the mgm macau and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions and is in the process of developing a gaming resort in cotai see below for additional information about the cotai development project   through the acquisition of the additional 1 interest of mgm china we obtained a controlling interest and were required to consolidate mgm china as of june 3 2011 prior to the ipo we held a 50 interest in mgm grand paradise which was accounted for under the equity method the acquisition of the controlling financial interest was accounted for as a business combination and we recognized 100 of the assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests of mgm china at fair value at the date of acquisition the fair value of the equity of mgm china was determined by the ipo transaction price and equaled approximately 75 billion the carrying value of our equity method investment was significantly less than our share of the fair value of mgm china resulting in a 35 billion gain on the acquisition   we believe our investment in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability asia is the fastestgrowing gaming market in the world and macau is the worlds largest gaming destination in terms of revenue and has continued to grow over the past few years despite the global economic downturn   on october 18 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government for its planned development on cotai the land concession contract became effective on january 9 2013 when the macau government published it in the official gazette of macau and has an initial term of 25 years the land premium payable to the macau government for the land concession contract is approximately 161 million and is composed of a down payment and eight additional semiannual payments in october 2012 mgm china paid approximately 56 million as the initial down payment of the contract premium including interest on the eight semiannual payments mgm china has approximately 118 million remaining payable for the land concession contract in addition mgm grand paradise is required to pay the macau government approximately 269000 per year  39      in rent during the course of development of the land and approximately 681000 per year in rent once the

finalizing its designs under the terms of the land concession contract mgm grand paradise is required to complete the development of the land within 60 months from the date of publication   our current mgm china operations consist of mgm macau and the development of the new gaming resort in cotai revenues at mgm macau are generated primarily from gaming operations made up of two distinct market segments main floor and highend vip mgm macau main floor operations consist of both table games and slot machines offered to the public which usually consists of walkin and day trip visitors vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by inhouse vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through the use of gaming promoters also known as junket operators these operators introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau assist these customers with travel arrangements and extend gaming credit to these players   vip gaming at mgm macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips called rolling chips gaming promoters purchase these rolling chips from mgm macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players the rolling chips allow mgm macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters clients in order to determine vip gaming play in exchange for the gaming promoters services mgm macau pays them either through rolling chip turnoverbased commissions or through revenuesharing arrangements the estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to vip customers is recorded net against casino revenue and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded to casino expense   in addition to the key performance indicators used by our wholly owned domestic resorts mgm macau utilizes turnover which is the sum of rolling chip wagers won by mgm macau rolling chips purchased plus rolling chips exchanged less rolling chips returned turnover provides a basis for measuring vip casino win percentage

recorded impairment charges related to our investment in borgata in each of the three years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010   in 2010 we recorded an impairment charge of approximately 128 million which decreased the carrying value of our investment in borgata to approximately 250 million as of september 30 2010 the impairment charge was based on an offer received from a potential buyer at that time and authorized by our board of directors we ultimately did not reach final agreement with such buyer  45       in 2011 we determined that it was necessary to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge for our investment in borgata of 62 million as of december 31 2011 using an estimated fair value for our investment of 185 million based on a discounted cash flow analysis key assumptions included in such analysis include managements estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capital expenditures an appropriate discount rate and longterm growth rate at the time there was significant uncertainty surrounding borgatas future operating results primarily due to the planned opening of a major new resort in the atlantic city market during 2012 and other additional competition expected in surrounding markets as a result for purposes of this analysis management reflected a decrease in forecasted cash flows in 2012 and 2013 also management used a longterm growth rate of 3 and a discount rate of 105 which it believed appropriately reflects risk associated with the estimated cash flows   in 2012 we determined that it was necessary to record an additional otherthantemporary impairment charge for our investment in borgata of 65 million as of december 31 2012 using an estimated fair value for our investment of 120 million based on a discounted cash flow analysis borgatas 2012 operating results did not meet previous forecasts while 2012 results for borgata were significantly impacted by hurricane sandy management believes the challenging environment in atlantic city will continue and has lowered 2013 estimates below what was previously forecasted also we used a longterm growth rate of 25 and a discount rate of 105 which we believe appropriately reflects risk associated with the estimated cash flows this analysis is sensitive to management assumptions and increases or decreases in these assumptions would have a material impact on the analysis   las vegas strip land we own 335 acres on the north end of the las vegas strip which we have been holding for future development we have focused our development efforts on other jurisdictions which led to us reviewing our significant development land holdings for impairment indicators due to our focus on future development outside of the las vegas area we do not believe it is likely we will recover the carrying value of our 335 acres of land on the north end of the las vegas strip on an undiscounted basis therefore we recorded an impairment charge of 366 million as of december 31 2012 based on an estimated fair value of 214 million for the land we determined fair value of the land using a market approach based on assessment of comparable land sales in las vegas adjusted for size and location factors based on comparisons to our land   atlantic city land we own two sites for a total of approximately 86 acres in atlantic city which we have been holding for future development due to our focus on future development outside atlantic city the continued deterioration of the atlantic city market and the initial underperformance of a new resort that opened in 2012 we do not believe it is likely we will recover the carrying value of this land on an undiscounted basis therefore we recorded an impairment charge of 167 million as of december 31 2012 based on an estimated fair value of 125 million for the land we determined fair value of the land using a market approach based on assessment of comparable land sales in atlantic city adjusted for size and location factors based on comparisons to our land   investment in grand victoria at june 30 2012 we reviewed the carrying value of our grand victoria investment for impairment due to a decrease in operating results at the property and the loss of market share as a result of the opening of a new riverboat casino in the illinois market as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flows for 2013 through 2015 we used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value key assumptions included in the analysis were estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capital expenditures a longterm growth rate of 2 and a discount rate of 105 as a result of the discounted cash flow analysis we determined that it was necessary to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 85 million based on an estimated fair value of 205 million for our 50 interest we intend to and believe we will be able to retain our investment in grand victoria however due to the extent of the shortfall and our assessment of the uncertainty of fully recovering our investment we determined that the impairment was otherthantemporary  46       investment in silver legacy silver legacy had approximately 143 million of outstanding senior secured notes that were due in march 2012 silver legacy did not repay its notes at maturity and filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in may 2012 these notes were nonrecourse to us we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge at december 31 2011 which decreased the carrying value of our investment in silver legacy to zero and ceased applying the equity method for our investment in silver legacy in november 2012 silver legacy completed a consensual plan of reorganization pursuant to which the holders of the senior secured notes received a combination of cash and new second lien notes concurrently silver legacy entered into an agreement for a new 70 million senior secured credit facility which provided for a portion of the exit financing associated with the plan of reorganization as part of the reorganization the partners invested 75 million each in the form of subordinated sponsor notes we resumed the equity method of accounting for our investment in silver legacy subsequent to completion of the reorganization   investment in citycenter at june 30 2010 we reviewed our citycenter investment for impairment using revised operating forecasts developed by citycenter management based on the then current and forecasted market conditions and because citycenters results of operations through june 30 2010 were below previous forecasts and the revised operating forecasts were lower than previous forecasts we concluded that we should review the carrying value of our investment we determined that the carrying value of our investment exceeded our fair value determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and therefore an impairment was indicated we intend to and believe we will be able to retain our investment in citycenter however due to the extent of the shortfall and our assessment of the uncertainty of fully recovering our investment we determined that the impairments were otherthantemporary and recorded impairment charges of 112 billion in the second quarter of 2010   at september 30 2010 we recognized an increase of 232 million in our total net obligation under our citycenter completion guarantee and a corresponding increase in our investment in citycenter the increase primarily reflected a revision to prior estimates based on our assessment of the most current information derived from our closeout and litigation processes we completed an impairment review as of september 30 2010 and as a result recorded an additional impairment of 191 million in the third quarter of 2010   the discounted cash flow analyses for our investment in citycenter included estimated future cash inflows from operations including residential sales and estimated future cash outflows for capital expenditures the june 2010 and september 2010 analyses used an 11 discount rate and a long term growth rate of 4 related to forecasted cash flows for citycenters operating assets   circus circus reno at september 30 2011 we reviewed the carrying value of our circus circus reno longlived assets for impairment using revised operating forecasts developed by management for that resort in the third quarter of 2011 due to the then current and forecasted market conditions and results of operations through september 30 2011 being lower than previous forecasts we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 80 million in the third quarter of 2011 primarily related to a writedown of circus circus renos longlived assets our discounted cash flow analysis for circus circus reno included estimated future cash inflows from operations and estimated future cash outflows for capital expenditures utilizing an estimated pretax discount rate of 165 and a longterm growth rate of 2   other other property transactions net in 2012 include writedowns related to the remodeling of the theatre at mandalay bay the renovation of the imax theatre at luxor and various other miscellaneous asset disposals and disposal costs other property transactions in 2011 include the writeoff of goodwill related to railroad pass other property transactions during 2010 related primarily to writedowns of various discontinued capital projects

the equity method of accounting in june 2011 and we ceased recording borgata operating results as income from unconsolidated affiliates in march 2010   our share of citycenter operating losses included our share of residential inventory impairment charges of 18 million 26 million and 166 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively upon substantial completion of construction of the mandarin oriental residential inventory in the first quarter of 2010 and the veer residential inventory in the second quarter of 2010 citycenter was required to carry its residential inventory at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell fair value of the residential inventory is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on managements current expectations of future cash

related to the modification of our senior credit facility in march 2010   we hold south jersey transportation authority special revenue bonds the original proceeds from which were used to provide

made to the casino reinvestment development authority from future casino licensees on the renaissance pointe land owned by us however we believe the probability for casino development on renaissance pointe in the foreseeable future is remote due to the continued deterioration of the atlantic city market and initial underperformance of a recent resort that opened in the market as such we have

of refunds    6982    172018   330218       the income tax benefit on pretax loss in 2012 was substantially below the 35 statutory rate primarily due to the fact that we began recording a valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets during the year we recorded an income tax benefit in 2011 even though we had pretax income for the year because we did not provide us deferred taxes on the 35 billion gain recorded on the acquisition of the controlling financial interest in mgm china the gain increased the excess amount for financial reporting over the us tax basis of our investment in mgm china no us deferred taxes were provided for this excess amount because we expect it to resolve through repatriations of future mgm china earnings for which there will be sufficient foreign tax credits to offset all us income tax that would result from such repatriations excluding the mgm china gain we would have provided income tax benefit at an effective tax rate of 607 for 2011 higher than the federal statutory rate due primarily to an income tax benefit resulting from a decrease to the macau net deferred tax liability recorded to reflect an assumed 5year extension of the exemption from complementary tax on gaming profits and a lower effective tax rate on mgm china earnings the income tax benefit on pretax loss in 2010 was provided essentially at the federal statutory rate of 35   cash taxes paid in 2012 consisted primarily of foreign and state taxes the net refunds of cash taxes in 2011 and 2010 were due primarily to the carryback to prior years of us federal income tax net operating losses incurred in 2010 and 2009 respectively all us net operating loss carryback refund potential was realized as a result of these carrybacks and tax net operating losses may now only be carried forward    nongaap measures    adjusted ebitda is earnings before interest and other nonoperating income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses property transactions net and the gain on the mgm china transaction adjusted property ebitda is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the

calculation of adjusted ebitda for mgm china adjusted ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes these measures are 1 widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industry and 2 a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies   we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects property transactions net includes normal recurring disposals gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period in addition capital allocation tax planning financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level therefore we use adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of wholly owned domestic resorts operating performance   adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments taxes and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitda information may calculate adjusted ebitda in a different manner   the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss

in january 2011 we entered into an amended completion and cost overrun guarantee which is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of circus circus las vegas as well as certain undeveloped land adjacent to that property the terms of the amended completion guarantee provide citycenter the ability to utilize up to 124 million of subsequent net residential proceeds to fund construction costs or to reimburse us for construction costs previously expended as of december 31 2012 citycenter had received net residential proceeds in excess of the 124 million and is holding 112 million in a separate bank account representing the remaining condo proceeds available to fund completion guarantee obligations or be reimbursed to us in accordance with citycenters credit agreement and bond indentures such amounts can only be used to fund construction lien obligations or reimbursed to us once the perini litigation is settled   as of december 31 2012 we have funded 692 million under the completion guarantee and have accrued a liability of 28 million which includes estimated litigation costs related to the resolution of disputes with contractors concerning the final construction costs and estimated amounts to be paid to contractors through the legal process related to the perini litigation our estimated obligation has been offset by the portion of the condo proceeds received by citycenter estimated to be used to settle construction lien claims upon the resolution of the perini litigation but has not been offset by the remaining amount that we currently estimate we will be reimbursed from condo proceeds that have been received by citycenter also our accrual reflects certain estimated offsets to the amounts claimed by the contractors citycenter has reached settlement agreements with all but seven of perinis firsttier subcontractors however significant disputes remain with the general contractor and the remaining subcontractors amounts claimed by such parties exceed amounts included in our completion guarantee accrual by approximately 154 million as such amounts exceed our best estimate of our liability moreover we have not accrued for any contingent payments to citycenter related to the harmon hotel amp spa component which will not be completed using the building as it now stands   harmon demolition in response to a request by the clark county building division the building division citycenter engaged an engineer to conduct an analysis based on all available information as to the structural stability of the harmon under buildingcodespecified load combinations on july 11 2011 that engineer submitted the results of his analysis of the harmon tower and podium in its current asbuilt condition the engineer opined among other things that in a codelevel earthquake using either the permitted or current code specified loads it is likely that critical structural members in the tower will fail and become incapable of supporting gravity loads leading to a partial or complete collapse of the tower there is missing or misplaced reinforcing steel in columns beams shear walls and transfer walls throughout the structure of the tower below the twentyfirst floor based on this engineering opinion the building division requested a plan of action from citycenter citycenter informed the building division it decided to abate the potential for structural collapse of the harmon in the event of a codelevel earthquake by demolishing the building and enclosed a plan of action for demolition by implosion prepared by lvi environmental services of nevada inc lvi citycenter also advised that prior to undertaking the demolition plan of action it would seek relief from a standing order of the district court judge presiding over the perini litigation that prohibits alteration or destruction of the building without  57      court approval in addition citycenter supplied the foundational data for the engineering conclusions stated in the july 11 2011 letter declaring the harmons structural instability in the event of a codelevel earthquake on november 22 2011 the building division required that citycenter submit a plan to abate the code deficiencies discovered in the harmon tower   in december 2011 citycenter resubmitted to the building division the plan of abatement action prepared by lvi which was first submitted on august 15 2011 and met with the building division about the requirements necessary to obtain demolition permits and approvals as discussed above the timing of the demolition of the harmon is subject to rulings in the perini litigation   we do not believe we would be responsible for funding under the completion guarantee any additional remediation efforts that might be required with respect to the harmon however our view is based on a number of developing factors including with respect to ongoing litigation with citycenters contractors actions by local officials and other developments related to the citycenter venture all of which are subject to change citycenters revolving credit facility provides that certain demolition or repair expenses may be funded only from i member contributions designated for demolition of the harmon ii the proceeds of certain specified extraordinary receipts which include any proceeds from the perini litigation or iii cash or cash equivalents in an amount not to exceed 30 million in the aggregate based on current estimates which are subject to change we believe the demolition of the harmon would cost approximately 32 million

loss of any gaming license affecting a specified amount of its revenues or assets will constitute an event of default   all of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our material domestic subsidiaries other than mgm grand detroit llc which is a coborrower under our senior credit facility and its subsidiaries and our insurance subsidiaries our international subsidiaries including mgm china and its subsidiaries are not guarantors of such indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may from time to time in our sole discretion purchase repay redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions by tender offer or otherwise pursuant to authorization of our board of directors   in october 2012 mgm china and mgm grand paradise as coborrowers entered into an amended and restated credit facility agreement which consists of approximately 550 million of term loans and a 145 billion revolving credit facility due october 2017 the outstanding balance at december 31 2012 was 554 million and is comprised solely of term loans the interest rate on the facility fluctuates annually based on hibor plus a margin set at 25 for the first six months and ranging between 175 and 25 thereafter based on mgm chinas leverage ratio under the amended and restated credit facility agreement mgm china is a joint and several coborrower with mgm grand paradise the material subsidiaries of mgm china continue to guarantee the facilities and mgm china mgm grand paradise and their guarantor subsidiaries have granted a security interest on substantially all of their assets to secure the amended facilities the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes and for the development of the proposed cotai development as of december 31 2012 the credit facility was denominated entirely in hong kong dollars and interest was based on a margin of 25 plus hibor   the amended and restated mgm china credit facility agreement contains customary representations and warranties events of default affirmative covenants and negative covenants which impose restrictions on among other things the ability of mgm china and its subsidiaries to make investments pay dividends and sell assets and to incur additional debt and additional liens mgm china is also required to maintain compliance with a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio of 450 to 100 prior to the first anniversary of the mgm cotai opening date and 400 to 100 thereafter and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 250 to 100    off balance sheet arrangements    our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates which consist primarily of our investments in citycenter grand victoria and silver legacy we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a fullscale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment we have not historically guaranteed financing obtained by our investees and there are no other provisions of the venture agreements which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort  59       commitments and contractual

facility and hibor rates for the mgm grand paradise credit facility 2approximately 119 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and other tax liabilities are excluded from the table as we cannot reasonably estimate when examination and other activity related to these amounts will conclude 3under our completion guarantee for citycenter we are committed to fund amounts in excess of currently funded project costs based on current forecasted expenditures we estimate that we will be required to fund approximately 28 million for such guarantee excluding amounts expected to be received from residential proceeds received by citycenter of 73 million 4the amount for 2013 includes approximately 193 million of construction commitments 100 million of employment agreements 94 million of entertainment agreements and 59 million of open purchase orders other commitments include various contracted amounts including information technology advertising maintenance and other service agreements our largest entertainment commitments consist of minimum contractual payments to cirque du soleil which performs shows at several of our resorts our contractual commitments for these shows generally do not exceed 12 months and are based on our ability to exercise certain termination rights however we expect these shows to continue for longer periods excluded from the above table is approximately 118 million of the remaining premium and interest payable to the macau government for the cotai land concession as the agreement was not effective until it was published in the official gazette of macau in january 2013    as discussed in executive overview and in liquidity and capital resources we have made significant progress toward improving our financial position our december 2012 financing transactions provided for a significant reduction in interest expense projected for 2013 and enabled us to extend our maturities in addition our access to lower cost financing and ability to finance development opportunities has also improved significantly as a result of these transactions while we have significant indebtedness we believe we have the ability to meet known obligations including principal and interest obligations as well as planned capital expenditures over the next few years with cash flows from operations and availability under our senior credit facility   we expect to spend approximately 350 million in capital expenditures at our wholly owned domestic resorts during 2013 we do not expect to spend significant amounts of capital on new developments but future capital expenditures could vary from our current expectations depending on the progress of our development efforts and the structure of our ownership interests in future developments in macau we expect to spend approximately 250 million on capital improvements at mgm macau and our cotai project excluding land and capitalized interest during 2013   critical accounting policies and estimates   managements discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make  60      estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates however by their nature judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates    business combinations    we accounted for our acquisition of mgm china in june 2011 as a business combination and have historically had significant acquisitions accounted for as business combinations in a business combination we determine the fair value of acquired assets including identifiable intangible assets assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests the fair value of the acquired business is allocated to the acquired assets assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests based on their fair value with any remaining fair value allocated to goodwill this allocation process requires use of estimates and assumptions including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets identifiable finitelife intangible assets such as certain license rights and customer lists are amortized over the intangible assets estimated useful life the method of amortization reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed if determinable normally estimated based on estimated future cash flows of the intangible asset goodwill as well as other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment as discussed further below    allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable    marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at aria bellagio mgm grand las vegas and the mirage in addition mgm china extends credit to certain in house gaming customers and gaming promoters our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau at december 31 2012 and 2011 approximately 27 and 28 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states at december 31 2012 and 2011 approximately 63 and 61 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability among other factors when we issue credit to customers who are not residents of the united states   we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customers financial condition collection history and any other known information we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate   in addition to enforceability issues the collectibility of unpaid markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the  61      allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a regions economy occur   the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables                         at december 31          2012    2011    2010          in thousands      casino receivables    294312    347679    229318      allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable     90452     94800

million of casino receivables and 14 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31 2012 the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has increased in the current year primarily due to an increase in the aging of accounts at december 31 2012 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change pretax net income by 3 million    fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies    property and equipment are stated at cost for the majority of our property and equipment cost has been determined based on estimated fair values in connection with the june 2011 mgm china acquisition the april 2005 mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period   we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment in addition our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively    impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets    we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as a held for sale or b to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist  62      we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset for operating assets fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses   there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates   on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results negative industry or economic factors significant changes to our operating environment or changes in intended use of the asset group we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group including potential sale historically undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin   we review indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach and trademarks which are tested for impairment using the relieffromroyalty method goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates as of the date we completed our 2012 goodwill impairment analysis the estimated fair values of our reporting units with associated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying values for all our reporting units with goodwill except for mgm china as of the date of our goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter we determined that the fair value of our mgm china reporting unit is slightly in excess of its carrying value therefore no impairment was indicated as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if future operating results for mgm china do not meet our current expectations we may be required to record an impairment charge related to the mgm china goodwill   there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the determination of capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions   see operating resultsdetails of charges for further discussion of write downs and impairments of longlived assets  63                   impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates    we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in value if such conditions exist we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is otherthantemporary based on our assessment of relevant factors including consideration of our intent and ability to retain our investment we estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates see results of operations for discussion of impairment charges    income taxes    we recognize deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied given the negative impact of the us economy on the results of operations in the past several years we no longer rely on future domestic operating income in assessing the realizability of our domestic deferred tax assets and now rely only on the future reversal of existing domestic taxable temporary differences as of december 31 2012 the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal deductible temporary differences exceeds the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal taxable temporary differences consequently during 2012 we began recording a valuation allowance for us federal deferred tax assets in order to account for this excess at december 31 2012 such valuation allowance was 10 billion in addition there is a 13 million valuation allowance after federal effect provided on certain state deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of 61 million on certain macau deferred tax assets because we believe these assets do not meet the more likely than not criteria for recognition   our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities   we assess our tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a more likely than not threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current other accrued liabilities or longterm other longterm liabilities based on the time until expected payment additionally we recognize accrued interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense   we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material   as of december 31 2012 we are no longer subject to examination of our us consolidated federal income tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2005 the irs completed its examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2003 and 2004 tax years during 2010 and we paid 12 million in tax and 4 million in associated interest with respect to adjustments to which we agreed in addition we submitted a protest to irs appeals of certain adjustments to which we did not agree we expect the issues subject to appeal will be settled within the next 12 months during the fourth quarter of 2010 the irs opened an examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2005 through 2009 tax years we expect that the irs will complete this examination within the next 12 months and we may agree to certain adjustments and protest others   during the first quarter of 2011 the irs opened audits of the 2007 through 2008 tax years of citycenter holdings llc an unconsolidated affiliate treated as a partnership for income tax purposes  64      and the 2008 through 2009 tax years of mgm grand detroit llc a subsidiary treated as a partnership for income tax purposes the irs has completed field work with respect to these examinations and the issuance of final audit reports is pending we may agree to certain adjustments and protest others   during 2010 we reached settlement with irs appeals with respect to the audit of the 2004 through 2006 tax years of mgm grand detroit llc at issue was the tax treatment of payments made under an agreement to develop own and operate a hotel casino in the city of detroit we agreed to pay 1 million in tax for such years as a result of this settlement   during the fourth quarter of 2010 we and our joint venture partner reached tentative settlement with irs appeals with respect to the audit of the 2003 and 2004 tax years of a cost method investee of ours that is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes the adjustments to which we agreed in such tentative settlement will be included in any settlement that we may reach with respect to the 2003 and 2004 examination of our consolidated federal income tax return the irs is currently auditing the 2005 through 2009 tax years of this investee we expect that the irs will complete this examination within the next 12 months and we may agree to certain adjustments and protest others   during 2010 the irs closed its examination of the federal income tax return of mandalay resort group for the preacquisition year ended april 25 2005 and issued a nochange letter the statutes of limitations for assessing tax for all mandalay resort group preacquisition years are now closed   as of december 31 2012 other than adjustments resulting from the federal income tax audits discussed above and the exceptions noted below we were no longer subject to examination of our various state and local tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2008 during 2010 the state of illinois initiated an audit of our illinois combined returns for the 2006 and 2007 tax years such audit closed in 2012 resulting in an immaterial refund of taxes from such years during 2010 the state of new jersey began audit procedures of a cost method investee of ours for the 2003 through 2006 tax years no other state or local income tax returns are currently under exam    stockbased compensation    we account for stock options and stock appreciation rights sars measuring fair value using the blackscholes model for restricted share units rsus compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant we account for performance stock units psus measuring fair value using the monte carlo valuation model there are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the blackscholes model and monte carlo valuation model our volatility and expected term assumptions used in the blackscholes model can significantly affect the fair value of stock options and sars the monte carlo valuation model also utilizes multiple assumptions including volatility to determine the fair value of the award changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of sharebased compensation and consequently the related amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements the extent of the impact will depend in part on the extent of awards in any given year for 2012 a 10 change in the assumptions used in the blackscholes and monte carlo valuation models would not have resulted in a material impact on the fair value of the awards granted   2005 omnibus incentive plan in 2012 we granted 26 million sars and 07 million psus with a total fair value of 22 million in 2011 we granted 35 million sars with a total fair value of 19 million in 2010 we granted 38 million sars with a total fair value of 27 million   mgm china share option plan in 2012 mgm china granted 10 million stock options with a total fair value of 1 million in 2011 mgm china granted 193 million stock options with a total fair value of 24

after december 15 2011 such amendments included a consistent definition of fair value enhanced disclosure requirements for level 3 fair value adjustments and other changes to required disclosures our adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on our financial statements   in june 2011 asc 220 comprehensive income was amended and became effective for us for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 we elected to present a separate statement of comprehensive income which provides each component of net income along with total net income each component of other comprehensive

september 2011 asc 350 intangiblesgoodwill and others was amended to simplify the assessment of goodwill impairment and became effective for us for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 the amended guidance allows us to do an initial qualitative assessment of relative events and circumstances to determine if fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying value prior to performing the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test our adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on our financial statements   in july 2012 asc 350 intangiblesgoodwill and others was amended to simplify the assessment of testing the impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill and will become effective for us for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 the amended guidance allows us to do an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts prior to performing the quantitative indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test we do not believe the adoption of this amendment will have a material effect on our financial statements   market risk   in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations we are also exposed to additional market risks market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions   as of december 31 2012 longterm variable rate borrowings represented approximately 25 of our total borrowings assuming a 100 basispoint increase in libor in the case of term b loans over the 1 floor specified in our senior credit facility our annual interest cost would change by approximately 28 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31 2012 assuming a 100 basispoint increase in hibor for the mgm grand paradise credit facility our annual interest cost would change by  66      approximately 6 million based on amounts outstanding at december 31 2012 the following table provides additional
