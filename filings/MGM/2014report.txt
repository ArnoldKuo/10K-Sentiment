travel and forbes travel guide four star awards  our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend gaming customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year while our results do not depend on key individual customers a significant portion of our operating income is generated from highend gaming customers which can cause variability in our results in addition our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a country or region can affect our results  all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of grand victoria which operates 22 hours a day every day of the year at our

resorts can be found in exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference  wholly owned domestic resorts over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities  our casino operations feature a variety of slots table games and race and sports book wagering in addition we offer our premium players access to highlimit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere  mgm china on june 3 2011 we and ms ho pansy catilina chiu king ms pansy ho completed a reorganization of the capital structure of mgm china pursuant to which we acquired an additional 1 interest in mgm china and thereby became the owner of 51 of mgm china through the acquisition of the additional 1 interest of mgm china we obtained a controlling interest and were required to consolidate mgm china as of june 3 2011 prior to the transaction we held a 50 interest in mgm grand paradise sa mgm grand paradise which was accounted for under the equity method we believe our ownership interest in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability asia is the fastestgrowing gaming market in the world and macau is the worlds largest gaming destination in terms of revenue and has continued to grow over the past few years despite the global economic downturn  our current mgm china operations relate to mgm macau and the development of a casino resort on the cotai strip in macau discussed further below revenues at mgm macau are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by mgm grand paradise the macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession was granted by sociedade de jogos de macau    3     sa and expires in 2020 the macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations  in october 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of macau to develop a resort and casino on an approximately 178 acre site in cotai macau mgm cotai the land concession contract became effective when the macau government published the agreement in the official gazette of macau on january 9 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years under the terms of the land concession contract mgm grand paradise is required to complete the development of the land by january 2018 also in october 2012 mgm china and mgm grand paradise as coborrowers successfully closed on a 20 billion amended and restated credit facility agreement which we believe ensures the necessary funding for the mgm cotai project  mgm china has finalized the design of the mgm cotai project and construction of the foundation commenced in 2013 in may 2013 mgm china entered into an agreement with china state construction engineering corporation to serve as the sole general contractor for the project mgm cotai will be an integrated casino hotel and entertainment resort with approximately 1600 hotel rooms 500 gaming tables and up to 2500 slots the total estimated project budget is 29 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs  customers and competition  our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments we compete against gaming companies as well as other hospitality companies in the markets we operate in neighboring markets and in other parts of the world including nongaming resort destinations such as hawaii our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states and internationally  our primary methods of successful competition include            locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets          constructing and maintaining highquality resorts and facilities including luxurious guestrooms stateoftheart convention facilities and premier dining entertainment retail and other amenities          recruiting training and retaining wellqualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service          providing unique mustsee entertainment attractions and          developing distinctive and memorable marketing promotional and customer loyalty programs  wholly owned domestic resorts our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the las vegas area including major hotel casinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotel casinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the strip and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority there were approximately 151000 guestrooms in las vegas at december 31 2013 and 2012 at december 31 2013 we operated approximately 27 of the guestrooms in las vegas las vegas visitor volume was 397 million in both 2013 and 2012  the las vegas market includes leisure travel customers premium gaming customers convention customers including small meetings trade associations and corporate incentive programs and tour and travel customers our luxury wholly owned resorts including bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage appeal to the upper end of each market segment balancing their business by using the convention and tour and travel segments to fill the midweek and offpeak periods our marketing strategy for new yorknew york luxor and monte carlo is aimed at attracting middle to uppermiddleincome customers largely from the leisure travel and the tour and travel segments excalibur and circus circus las vegas generally cater to the valueoriented and middleincome leisure travel and tour and travel segments    4    outside of las vegas our other nevada operations compete with each other and with many other similarly sized and larger operations our nevada resorts located outside of las vegas appeal primarily to the valueoriented leisure traveler and the valueoriented local customer a significant number of our customers at these resorts come from california  outside of nevada our resorts primarily compete for customers in local and regional gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region for example in detroit michigan we compete with a casino in nearby windsor canada and with native american casinos in michigan in biloxi mississippi we compete with regional riverboat and landbased casinos in louisiana native american casinos in central mississippi and with casinos in florida and the bahamas  mgm china our key competitors in macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires if the macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows additionally several concessionaires have expansion plans announced or underway primarily located on the cotai strip the properties currently operating in cotai have achieved a higher growth rate than those located on the macau peninsula we expect competition in the macau market to continue to increase as more capacity is brought online in the near future we also encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of asia and around the world including singapore malaysia the philippines australia new zealand las vegas cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region  the three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market are vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations  vip gaming play is sourced both internally and externally externally sourced vip gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who offer vip players various services such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel food and beverage services gaming promoters operate vip gaming rooms within the property in exchange for their services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of commission we extend credit and provide complimentaries to our internally sourced vip clientele without the use of an intermediary these clientele are acquired through our direct marketing efforts  the main floor gaming operation in macau is also referred to as the mass gaming operation unlike vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future to target premium main floor players in order to grow revenue and improve yield we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadiumstyle electronic table games terminals which includes both table games and slots to the main floor gaming area the amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor players  corporate and other much like our wholly owned resorts our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts aria which we manage and own 50 through the citycenter joint venture appeals to the upper end of each segment in the las vegas market and competes with our wholly owned luxury casino resorts and other luxury resorts on the las vegas strip our other unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers against casino resorts in their respective markets  marketing  our marketing efforts are conducted through various means including our loyalty programs as discussed further below we advertise on radio television internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in    5     selected cities throughout the united states and overseas as well as by direct mail email and through the use of social media we also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major us and foreign cities a key element of marketing to premium gaming customers is personal contact by our marketing personnel direct marketing is also important in the convention segment we maintain websites to inform

to expand several luxurious private gaming salons that provide distinctive highend environments for the vip players brought to the resort through gaming promoters and the inhouse vip marketing team the resort has created a variety of incentive programs to reward gaming promoters for increased business and efficiency  technology  we utilize various types of technology to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations we continue to move forward on standardizing the technology platforms for several of our key operational systems the standardization of these systems provides us with one consistent operating platform allowing us efficiencies in training reducing complexity in system integration and interfaces standardizing processes across our casino resorts and providing our customers with better information these systems capture charges made by our customers during their stay including allowing customers of our resorts to charge meals and services at our other resorts to

evaluating sustainable hotel operations we received certifications at 12 resorts including five green key the highest possible ratings at aria vdara and mandalay bay many major travel service providers recognize the green key designation and identify our resorts for their continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations  in addition we believe that incorporating the tenets of sustainability in our business decisions provides a platform for innovation and operational efficiency citycenter is one of the worlds largest private green developments with six leed gold certifications from the us green building council citycenter serves as a new standard for combining luxury and environmental responsibility within the largescale hospitality industry we incorporate

with the supervision of gaming activities at our casinos we maintain stringent controls on the recording of all receipts and disbursements and other activities including cash transaction reporting which is essential in our industry marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at our highend resorts we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to timely pay their marker balances these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices direct personal contact and the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation  development and leveraging our brand and management assets  in allocating resources our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts spending on new resorts or initiatives and repaying longterm debt we believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide profitable returns although these decisions were significantly affected by economic conditions over the past several years when our access to capital was limited  we regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in domestic and international

ability to service or refinance our indebtedness and to make planned expenditures and investments          restrictions and limitations in the agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness could significantly affect our ability to operate our business as well as significantly affect our liquidity          significant competition we face with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete          the fact that our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or

upon gaming promoters for a significant portion of gaming revenues in macau          extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business          the

business travel especially travel by air to global geopolitical events such as terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility          the fact that investing through partnerships or joint ventures including citycenter decreases our ability to manage risk          the fact that future construction or development projects will be susceptible to substantial development and construction risks          the fact that our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future          the fact that citycenter has decided to abate the potential for structural collapse of the harmon in the event of a codelevel earthquake by demolishing the building which exposes us to risks prior to or in connection with the demolition process          the fact that a failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our

act or other similar anticorruption laws          risks related to pending claims that have been or future claims that may be brought against us          the fact that a significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements          the sensitivity of our business to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results          the potential that failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and internal customer information could result in damage of reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or other restrictions on our use or transfer of data          increases in gaming taxes and fees in the jurisdictions in which we operate          the potential for conflicts of interest to arise because

risk factors  you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows in evaluating us you should consider carefully among other things the risks described below  risks relating to our substantial indebtedness            our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 135 billion principal amount of indebtedness outstanding including 28 billion of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured credit facility we had approximately 12 billion of available borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility as of december 31 2013 any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs in addition as of december 31 2013 mgm grand paradise sa mgm grand paradise the company that owns and operates mgm macau had approximately 553 million of debt outstanding under its credit facility we do not guarantee mgm grand paradises obligations under its credit agreement and to the extent mgm macau were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service its indebtedness our ability to make additional investments into that entity is limited by the negative covenants in our senior secured credit facility in addition our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences including            increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions          limiting our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in our business and industry          limiting our ability to borrow additional funds          making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness or          placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to lessleveraged competitors  moreover our businesses are capital intensive for our owned and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties wellmaintained modernized and refurbished such investment requires an ongoing supply of cash and to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained similarly future development projects and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments the incurrence of additional debt guarantees of thirdparty debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations            current and future economic and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service or refinance our indebtedness and to make planned expenditures our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures and investments in joint ventures depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future our ability to receive distributions from joint ventures and our ability to borrow under our senior secured credit facility to the extent of available borrowings if adverse regional and national economic conditions persist worsen or fail to improve significantly we could experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in consumer spending levels and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations continue to receive distributions from joint ventures or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs    14    we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2015 and thereafter our ability to timely refinance and replace such indebtedness will depend upon the foregoing as well as on continued and sustained improvements in financial markets if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments there is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us if at all on satisfactory terms on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements            the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business as well as significantly affect our liquidity and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations covenants governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict among other things our ability to            pay dividends or distributions repurchase or issue equity prepay certain debt or make certain investments          incur additional debt          incur liens on assets          sell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all assets          enter into transactions with affiliates          allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets and          enter into sale and leaseback transactions  our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness any default under our senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth our financial condition our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and could force us to seek protection under the bankruptcy laws  in addition mgm grand paradise and mgm china are coborrowers under an amended and restated credit facility which contains covenants that restrict their ability to engage in certain transactions in particular the mgm china amended and restated credit facility requires mgm china to satisfy various financial covenants including a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio and imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on mgm china and its subsidiaries including mgm grand paradise which include among other things limitations on its ability to pay dividends or distributions to us incur additional debt make investments or engage in other businesses merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer or sell assets  risks related to our business            we face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow the hotel resort and casino industries are highly competitive we do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area and hotel resort and gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our customers to the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations competition will increase major competitors including new entrants have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity or are currently expanding their capacity or constructing new resorts in las vegas and macau also the growth of gaming in areas outside las vegas including california has increased the competition faced by our    15          operations in las vegas and elsewhere in particular as large scale gaming operations on native american tribal lands has increased particularly in california competition has increased  in addition competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the united states and elsewhere result in the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos such as has happened in california for example while our macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near asia including singapore australia new zealand cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and unlicensed gaming operations certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming including malaysia vietnam cambodia and the philippines and others such as japan taiwan and thailand may legalize casino gaming or online gaming in the future furthermore currently mgm grand paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaries open additional facilities for example the facilities currently being developed in cotai macau we would face increased competition furthermore most jurisdictions in which casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical andor geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities which may include acquisitions of existing properties that do arise furthermore certain jurisdictions including nevada and new jersey have also legalized forms of online gaming and the expansion of online gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino resorts  in addition to competition with other hotels resorts and casinos we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow            our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries states and provinces in which we operate these laws regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but generally concern the responsibility financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations as such our gaming regulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or alternatively cease operations in that jurisdiction in addition unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions the regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we are subject to various gaming taxes which are subject to possible increase at any time by various state and federal legislatures and officials increases in gaming taxation could also adversely affect our results for a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect our business see regulation and licensing and exhibit 992 to this annual report on form 10k  further our directors officers key employees and joint venture partners must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities if state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or joint venture partner unsuitable we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the joint venture partner may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in the joint venture state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or joint venture partners to ensure compliance with applicable standards for example as a result of the new jersey division of gaming enforcement the dge    16     investigation of our relationship with our joint venture partner in macau we entered into a settlement agreement with the dge under which we were required to place in trust and sell our 50 ownership interest in borgata and related leased land in atlantic city on august 8 2011 the new jersey casino control commission approved an amendment to the settlement agreement extending the time within which the sale of the trust property was required to occur by 18 months so that until march 24 2013 we had the right to direct the trustee to sell the trust property the divestiture period but if the sale was not concluded by that date the trustee would have been authorized to sell such interests within the following 12 months the terminal sale period on february 13 2013 the settlement agreement was further amended to allow us to reapply to the ccc for licensure in new jersey and to defer expiration of these periods pending the outcome of the licensure process if the ccc denies our licensure request then the divestiture period will immediately end and the terminal sale period will immediately begin which will result in our borgata interest being disposed of by the trustee pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities  in macau current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are for the most part fairly recent and there is little precedent on the interpretation of these laws and regulations these laws and regulations are complex and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations or issue new or modified regulations that differ from mgm chinas interpretation which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations in addition mgm chinas activities in macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies we cannot assure you that mgm china will be able to obtain all necessary approvals and any such failure to do so may materially affect its longterm business strategy and operations macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions however to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues  in addition to gaming regulations we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters smoking employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising for instance we are subject to certain federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances including the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the oil pollution act of 1990 under various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted for example illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places including bars restaurants work places schools and casinos and in january 2013 casinos in macau including mgm china implemented a smoking ban in which a portion of casino floors are to be designated nonsmoking the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance  in addition we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various antimoney laundering laws and regulations such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted any violations of the antimoney laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows    17            our business is affected by economic and market conditions in the markets in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending on conventions and business development economic contraction economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for hotels casino resorts trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury amenities we offer in addition changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel an unstable job market perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and future acts of terrorism aria bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage in particular may be affected by economic conditions in the far east and all of our nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the united states and california in particular a recession economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts which would adversely affect our operating results for example the recent recession and downturn in consumer and corporate spending have had a negative impact on our results of operations in addition the weak housing and real estate marketboth generally and in nevada particularlyhas negatively impacted citycenters ability to sell residential units  in addition since we expect a significant number of customers to come to mgm macau from mainland china general economic and market conditions in china could impact our financial prospects any slowdown in economic growth or changes to chinas current restrictions on travel and currency movements could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china to mgm macau as well as the amounts they are willing to spend in the casino for example from 2008 through 2010 china readjusted its visa policy toward macau and limited the number of visits that some mainland chinese citizens may make to macau in a given time period in addition effective october 2013 china banned zerofare tour groups involving no or low upfront payments and compulsory shopping which were popular among visitors to macau from mainland china it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect become more restrictive or be readopted in the future these developments have had and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have the effect of reducing the number of visitors to macau from mainland china which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in macau  furthermore our operations in macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources and the adequacy of transportation infrastructure in macau to accommodate the demand from future development our success in macau will be impacted by our ability to retain and hire employees we compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of new developments in macau while we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resort certain macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications in addition because additional casino projects are under construction and are to be developed in the future existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to macau if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau the desirability of macau as a gaming destination as well as the results of operations at our development in cotai macau could be negatively impacted            we have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china in connection with the initial public offering of mgm china the holding company that indirectly owns and operates mgm macau we entered into a deed of noncompete undertakings with mgm china and ms pansy ho pursuant to which we are restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the peoples republic of china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china while gaming is currently prohibited in china hong kong and taiwan if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete with our competitors in these locations could be limited until the earliest of i march 31 2020 ii the date    18          mgm chinas ordinary shares cease to be listed on the stock exchange of hong kong limited or iii the date when our ownership of mgm china shares is less than 20 of the then issued share capital of mgm china            the macau government can terminate mgm grand paradises subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating mgm grand paradise the macau government can exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession in 2017 or the macau government can refuse to grant mgm grand paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2020 any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the subconcession in the event of fundamental noncompliance by mgm grand paradise with applicable macau laws or mgm grand paradises basic obligations under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such noncompliance with its fundamental obligations under the subconcession contract within a period to be stipulated by the macau government upon such termination all of mgm grand paradises casino area premises and gamingrelated equipment would be transferred automatically to the macau government without compensation to mgm grand paradise and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will perform all of its obligations under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the macau government  furthermore under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the macau government might promulgate in the future we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macau businesses if any disagreement arises between mgm grand paradise and the macau government regarding the interpretation of or mgm grand paradises compliance with a provision of the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the macau government during any consultation or negotiation mgm grand paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the macau government currently there is no precedent concerning how the macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above the loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in macau which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  in addition the subconcession contract expires on march 31 2020 unless the subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended all of mgm grand paradises casino premises and gamingrelated equipment will automatically be transferred to the macau government on that date without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations beginning on april 20 2017 the macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one years prior notice in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right mgm grand paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and nongaming revenue generated by mgm grand paradise excluding the convention and exhibition facilities during the taxable year prior to the redemption before deducting interest depreciation and amortization multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to renew or extend the subconcession contract on terms favorable to mgm grand paradise or at all we also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed the compensation paid to mgm grand paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues            we are required to build and open our development in cotai macau by january 2018 if we are unable to meet this deadline and the deadline for the development is not extended we may lose the land concession which would prohibit us from operating any facilities developed under such land    19          concession the land concession for the approximately 178 acre site on cotai macau was officially gazetted on january 9 2013 if we are unable to build and open our proposed resort and casino by january 2018 and the deadline is not extended the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the land concession contract a loss of the land concession could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows            mgm grand paradise is dependent upon gaming promoters for a significant portion of gaming revenues in macau gaming promoters who promote gaming and draw highend customers to casinos are responsible for a significant portion of mgm grand paradises gaming revenues in macau with the rise in gaming in macau the competition for relationships with gaming promoters has increased while mgm grand paradise is undertaking initiatives to strengthen relationships with gaming promoters there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain or grow relationships with gaming promoters if mgm grand paradise is unable to maintain or grow relationships with gaming promoters or if gaming promoters are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our highend customers mgm grand paradises ability to grow gaming revenues will be hampered  in addition the quality of gaming promoters is important to mgm grand paradises and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with gaming licenses while mgm grand paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters we cannot assure you that the gaming promoters with whom mgm grand paradise is or becomes associated with will meet the high standards insisted upon if a gaming promoter falls below mgm grand paradises standards mgm grand paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gaming regulators with authority over our operations  we also grant credit lines to our gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the recoverability of these loans            extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business which could harm our business and results of operations certain of our casino properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions including but not limited to hurricanes in the united states and severe typhoons in macau such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas in addition our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage a severe drought of extensive duration experienced in las vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adversely affect our business and results of operations although we maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme weather conditions such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect if at all on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions furthermore such extreme weather conditions may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows            because our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified given that our major resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the las vegas tourism industry for example the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from las vegas can adversely affect our business we cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from las vegas but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand can impact the number of visitors to our resorts additionally there is one principal interstate highway between las vegas and southern california where a large number of our customers reside capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities    20            we extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables we conduct a portion of our gaming activities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments table games players typically are issued more markers than slot players and highend players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts highend gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming and variances in winloss results attributable to highend gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter furthermore the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these highend customers could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cashflows we issue markers to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant in the opinion of management an extension of credit in addition mgm grand paradise extends credit to certain gaming promoters and those promoters can extend credit to their customers uncollectible receivables from highend customers and gaming promoters could have a significant impact on our results of operations  while gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the united states of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from us courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations  furthermore we expect that mgm macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions including macau to the extent mgm macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions mgm macau may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because among other reasons courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm macau may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts moreover under applicable law mgm macau remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers  even where gaming debts are enforceable they may not be collectible our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results            we may incur impairments to goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets which could negatively affect our future profits we review our goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative guidance significant negative trends reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in writedowns and impairment charges in the past and if one or more of such events occurs in the future additional impairment charges may be required in future periods if we are required to record additional impairment charges this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations            leisure and business travel especially travel by air are particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events such as terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility we are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air since most of our customers travel by air to our las vegas and macau properties any terrorist act outbreak of hostilities escalation of war or any actual or perceived threat to the security of travel by air could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows furthermore although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts insurance coverage against loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable            investing through partnerships or joint ventures including citycenter decreases our ability to manage risk in addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement    21          our business directly we have from time to time invested and expect to continue to invest as a coventurer joint venturers often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets therefore the operation of a joint venture is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters in addition joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that the coventurer might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives consequently actions by a coventurer might subject hotels and resorts owned by the joint venture to additional risk further we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners alternatively our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent additionally should a joint venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for our partners or coventurers share of joint venture liabilities  for instance citycenter which is 50 owned and managed by us has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations if citycenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our partners are unable to support future funding requirements as necessary such event could have adverse financial consequences to us in addition the agreements governing citycenters indebtedness subject citycenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness place liens upon assets make distributions to us make certain investments consummate certain asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates including us and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets the citycenter third amended and restated credit facility also includes certain financial covenants that require citycenter to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio as defined in citycenters third amended and restated credit facility for each quarter commencing on march 31 2014 we cannot be sure that citycenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test  in addition in accordance with our joint venture agreement and the citycenter third amended and restated credit facility we provided a cost overrun guarantee which is secured by our interests in the assets of circus circus las vegas and certain adjacent undeveloped land            any of our future construction or development projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks which could have a material adverse impact on related project timetables costs and our ability to complete the projects  any of our future construction or development projects will be subject to a number of risks including            lack of sufficient or delays in the availability of financing          changes to plans and specifications          engineering problems including defective plans and specifications          shortages of and price increases in energy materials and skilled and unskilled labor and inflation in key supply markets          delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals          changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations applicable to gaming leisure residential real estate development or construction projects          labor disputes or work stoppages          disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors          personal injuries to workers and other persons          environmental health and safety issues including site accidents and the spread of viruses          weather interferences or delays          fires typhoons and other natural disasters    22            geological construction excavation regulatory and equipment problems and          other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases  the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs delay or prevent the construction development or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future construction projects which we might undertake for instance we expect the total development costs of our cotai project to be approximately 29 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs we expect total development costs of our maryland project to be approximately 10 billion and our massachusetts project to be approximately 690 million each excluding capitalized interest and land related costs while we believe that the overall budgets for these developments are reasonable these development costs are estimates and the actual development costs may be higher than expected we cannot guarantee that our construction costs or total project costs for future projects including our developments in cotai and maryland and in massachusetts if we are awarded the license will not increase beyond amounts initially budgeted            our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer in addition our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future although we have all risk property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss such as fire natural disasters acts of war or terrorism each policy has certain exclusions in addition our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty in addition certain casualty events such as labor strikes nuclear events acts of war loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism deterioration or corrosion insect or animal damage and pollution may not be covered at all under our policies therefore certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses  in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event  we renew our insurance policies other than our builders risk insurance on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits further increase our deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage            citycenter has decided to abate the potential for structural collapse of the harmon in the event of a codelevel earthquake by demolishing the building and we are exposed to risks prior to or in connection with the demolition process after partial construction of the harmon citycenter discovered that in certain elements of the building known as link beams the reinforcing steel had been installed incorrectly by citycenters general contractor perini building company perini and its subcontractors after additional structural defects in other areas of the harmon were discovered further construction at the harmon was indefinitely stopped during the third quarter of 2010 citycenter determined that the harmon was unlikely to be completed using the existing partially completed structure as it now stands in response to a request by the clark county building division the building division citycenter engaged an engineer to conduct an analysis based on all available information as to the structural stability of the harmon under buildingcodespecified load combinations on july 11 2011 that engineer submitted the results of his analysis of the harmon tower and podium in its current asbuilt condition the engineer opined among other things that in a codelevel earthquake using either the permitted or current code specified loads it is likely that critical structural members in the tower will fail and become incapable of supporting gravity loads leading to a partial or complete collapse of the tower there is missing or misplaced reinforcing steel in columns beams shear walls and transfer walls throughout the structure of the tower below the twentyfirst floor based on this engineering opinion the building division requested a plan of action from citycenter citycenter    23          informed the building division that it decided to abate the potential for structural collapse of the harmon in the event of a codelevel earthquake by demolishing the building subject to the receipt of court approval on august 23 2013 the court granted citycenters motion and citycenter has commenced planning for demolition of the building on november 22 2013 the court granted perinis motion for reconsideration of the prior order granting citycenter permission to demolish the building on the basis that the builders risk insurer had objected to destruction of the harmon until completion of the builders risk insurers investigation of citycenters policy claim regarding the harmon a partial or complete collapse of the harmon prior to demolition or the demolition process itself could result in property damage or injury which could have a material adverse effect on citycenters and our business andor cause reputational harm to citycenter and us on january 31 2014 the court revoked its prior authorization of demolition of the harmon without prejudice to renewal of the application on the grounds that citycenters nonparty builders risk insurer requested further testing in the building            any failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business the development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success while our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one trademark or combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual property we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations through the use of trademarks we file applications for and obtain trademarks in the united states and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights parties may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource we cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the united states and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others the unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance competitive advantages or goodwill which could adversely affect our business            tracinda owns a significant amount of our common stock and may be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval as of december 31 2013 tracinda corporation beneficially owned approximately 19 of our outstanding common stock as a result tracinda may be able to exercise significant influence over any matter requiring stockholder approval including the approval of significant corporate transactions            we are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under nonunited states laws regulations and customs in particular the risks associated with the operation of mgm macau or any future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories include            changes in laws and policies that govern operations of companies in macau or other foreign jurisdictions          changes in nonunited states government programs          possible failure to comply with antibribery laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions          general economic conditions and policies in china including restrictions on travel and currency movements          difficulty in establishing staffing and managing nonunited states operations          different labor regulations          changes in environmental health and safety laws          potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws    24            political instability and actual or anticipated military and political conflicts          economic instability and inflation recession or interest rate fluctuations and          uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures  these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  we are also exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates if the united states dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries our united states dollar reported income from sources where revenue is dominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease            any violation of the foreign corrupt practices act or any other similar anticorruption laws could have a negative impact on us a significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the united states which exposes us to complex foreign and us regulations inherent in doing crossborder business and in each of the countries in which we transact business we are subject to compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other similar anticorruption laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the sec and us department of justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the fcpa the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations            we face risks related to pending claims that have been or future claims that may be brought against us claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries in various legal proceedings and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time we may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business financial condition and results of operations please see the further discussion in legal proceedings            a significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect our business and results of operations approximately 31600 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements a prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could have an adverse impact on our operations also wage andor benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition to the extent that our nonunion employees join unions we would have greater exposure to risks associated with labor problems            our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results we are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and therefore higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations accordingly increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results additionally higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues            the failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and internal customer information could result in damage of reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data we collect information relating to our guests for various business purposes including marketing and promotional purposes the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another    25          compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs andor adversely impact our ability to market our products properties and services to our guests in addition noncompliance with applicable privacy regulations by us or in some circumstances noncompliance by third parties engaged by us or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage of reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data  we also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of our computer systems through cyberattacks or otherwise could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations            we may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets any of which may be unsuccessful we intend to consider strategic and complementary investments in other businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with third parties investments in businesses properties or assets as well as these alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to            spending cash and incurring debt          assuming contingent liabilities          contributing properties or related assets to hospitality ventures that could result in recognition of losses or          creating additional expenses  we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from such investments or alliances            if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees our results could be adversely affected state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities from time to time legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws affecting the gaming industry periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase gaming taxes or fees depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected for instance income generated from gaming operations of mgm grand paradise currently has the benefit of a corporate tax exemption in macau which exempts us from paying the 12 complimentary tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games we expect to continue to benefit from this tax exemption through the end of 2016 and believe that we will be granted additional fiveyear exemptions in the future however we cannot assure you that any extensions of the tax exemption will be granted            conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of mgm china the holding company for mgm grand paradise which owns and operates mgm macau as a result of the initial public offering of shares of mgm china common stock mgm china now has stockholders who are not affiliated with us and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers andor directors of mgm china may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of mgm china decisions that could have different implications for us and mgm china including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with mgm china may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest      item 1b

statements allegedly made by the defendants during the period august 2007 through the date of such lawsuit filings in 2009 the class period in general the lawsuits assert the same or similar allegations including that during the relevant period defendants artificially inflated the companys common stock price by knowingly making materially false and misleading statements and omissions to the investing public about the companys financial statements and condition operations citycenter and the intrinsic value of the companys common stock that these alleged misstatements and omissions thereby enabled certain company insiders to derive personal profit from the sale of company common stock to the public that defendants caused plaintiffs and other shareholders to purchase company

restitution and disgorgement of alleged profits andor attorneys fees and costs in amounts to be proven at trial as well as injunctive relief related to corporate governance  the lawsuits are  in re

10b5 promulgated thereunder these cases were transferred in july 2010 to the honorable gloria m navarro in october 2010 the court appointed several employee retirement benefits funds as colead plaintiffs and their counsel as colead and coliaison counsel in january 2011 lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint alleging that between august 2 2007 and march 5 2009 the company its directors and certain of its officers artificially inflated the market price of the companys securities by knowingly making materially false and misleading public statements and omissions concerning the companys financial condition its liquidity its access to credit and the costs and progress of construction of the citycenter development the consolidated amended complaint asserts violations of sections 10b and 20a of the exchange act and rule 10b5 thereunder  in march 2011 all defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on the grounds that it fails to allege facts upon which relief could be granted under the federal securities laws and on the further ground that the complaint fails to satisfy the heightened pleading standards mandated by the private securities litigation reform act pslra the motions to dismiss emphasized three primary arguments 1 the complaint fails to allege that the defendants made false or misleading statements of fact as opposed to statements concerning plans and expectations that did not anticipate the severity of the financial crisis of 20082009 and the challenges presented by constructing citycenter 2 the complaint fails to allege facts supporting a strong inference of wrongful intent as the pslra requires and 3 the complaint fails to plead adequately that the alleged wrongdoing was the cause of the decline in the price of the companys publicly traded securities the parties completed the briefing in support of and in opposition to the motions to dismiss and requested oral argument on the motions    30    in march 2012 the court issued an order which granted the defendants motion to dismiss plaintiffs consolidated complaint without prejudice and allowed plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint on

company in excess of 10 million as well as equitable relief in the form of an order directing the company to reform its corporate governance and internal procedures in may 2010 the second judicial district court in washoe county transferred this case to the eighth judicial district court in clark county nevada case no a10619411c and in september 2010 the latter court consolidated this action with the charles kim v james j murren et al shareholder derivative action case no a09599937c discussed above  in december 2010 and january 2011 the company and its directors filed motions with the court to dismiss the derivative complaints in the israni and kim cases the defendant company officers also filed a separate motion to dismiss on the grounds that plaintiffs failed to allege either that a presuit demand had been made on the companys board of directors and had been wrongfully rejected or that making such a demand would have been futile because the case falls within the extremely rare circumstance where the board would have been legally incapable of exercising its business judgment on the litigation decision in march 2011 after the filing of these dismissal motions and pursuant to the parties stipulation the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint that asserted claims similar to those in their earlier complaints in april 2011 the defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on the same grounds as their original motions to dismiss after hearing on the motions to dismiss in june 2010 the court in july 2010 granted the motions on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to allege facts excusing them from making a presuit demand on the companys board of directors the court directed that the defendants submit a proposed order setting forth the factual and legal bases the defendants submitted a proposed order and the plaintiffs submitted an objection to the proposed order  in may 2012 the court in the israni and kim cases entered an order that granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend and an order that dismissed plaintiffs consolidated amended complaint with prejudice in june 2012 the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the district court ruling to the nevada supreme court on december 30 2013 the nevada supreme court affirmed the trial courts dismissal of these cases on the bases that plaintiffs failed to make a prelitigation demand upon the companys board of directors and to demonstrate a reasonable doubt as to whether a majority of the companys directors could exercise independent judgment and reasoning when considering a presuit demand    31    in re mgm mirage derivative litigation mario guerrero v james j murren et al case no 209cv01815kjdrjj filed september 14

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview  our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we believe that we own and invest in several of the premier casino resorts in the world and have continually reinvested in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financings fund capital expenditures and provide excess cash flow for future development we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities  results of operations from our wholly owned domestic resorts for the year ended december 31 2013 improved compared to the prior year as a result of increased casino and hotel revenues as general economic conditions continue to improve in the las vegas strip market as reported by the las vegas convention and visitors authority casino revenues increased 48 in addition the average room rate for the las vegas strip increased 28 compared to the same period in the prior year while visitation to las vegas was flat for the same period  in macau results of operations also improved for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of strong gaming volumes benefiting from economic growth in china despite concerns about the sustainability of economic growth in china we expect the macau market to continue to grow as the result of a large and growing asian middle class and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within macau according to statistics published by the statistics census service of the macau government visitor arrivals were 29 million in 2013 a 4 increase compared to 2012 gross casino revenues for the macau market increased 19 compared to the prior year with increases in both vip and main floor volumes  our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital in december 2012 we completed a comprehensive refinancing transaction that generated a significant reduction in interest expense for 2013 and extended the maturities of our longterm debt allowing us to maximize free cash flow and further enhance our deleveraging efforts in addition our access to lower cost financing and ability to finance development opportunities has also improved significantly as a result of these transactions  while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities in macau we plan to spend approximately 29 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs to develop a resort and casino featuring approximately 1600 hotel rooms 500 gaming tables and up to 2500 slots built on an approximately 178 acre site in cotai macau in addition we have been actively pursuing development opportunities in markets such as maryland and massachusetts  in december 2013 our subsidiary mgm national harbor llc mgm national harbor was awarded the license to operate the sixth and final casino under current statutes in the state of maryland by the maryland video lottery facility location commission to build and operate a worldclass destination resort casino in prince georges county at national harbor we currently expect the cost to develop and construct mgm national harbor to be approximately 10 billion excluding capitalized interest and land related costs we expect that the resort will include a casino with approximately 3600 slots 160 table games including poker a 300suite hotel with luxury spa and rooftop pool highend branded retail fine and casual dining a dedicated 3000 seat theater venue 35000 square feet of meeting and event space and a

from the massachusetts gaming commission mgc found us a suitable candidate for a casino license in the commonwealth we have since submitted to the mgc a completed license application for the next phase of the licensing process however there can be no assurance that the mgc will ultimately award us the license mgm springfield is proposed for 145 acres of land between union and state streets and columbus avenue and main street we currently expect the cost to develop and construct mgm springfield to be approximately 690 million excluding capitalized interest and land related costs  in 2013 we formed a 5050 joint venture las vegas arena company llc lva with a subsidiary of anschutz entertainment group inc a leader in sports entertainment and promotions to design construct and operate an arena on a parcel of our land located between frank sinatra drive and new yorknew york adjacent to the las vegas strip the proposed arena is anticipated to seat between 18000  20000 people and is currently scheduled to be completed in 2016 such development is estimated to cost approximately 350 million and is contingent on lva obtaining permanent financing  reportable segments  we have two reportable segments that are based on the regions in which we operate wholly owned domestic resorts and mgm china we currently operate 15 wholly owned resorts in the united states mgm chinas operations consist of the mgm macau resort and casino mgm macau and the development of a casino resort in cotai we have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates our mgm hospitality operations and certain other corporate and management operations citycenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate which we also manage for a fee our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as corporate and other operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results  wholly owned domestic resorts at december 31 2013 our wholly owned domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts           las vegas nevada   bellagio mgm grand las vegas including the signature mandalay bay the mirage luxor new yorknew york excalibur monte carlo and circus circus las vegas      other   mgm grand detroit in detroit michigan beau rivage in biloxi mississippi gold strike tunica in tunica mississippi circus circus reno in reno nevada gold strike in jean nevada and railroad pass in henderson nevada  over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customer groups and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities as a result of our leveraged business model our operating results are significantly affected by our ability to generate operating revenues also we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts in las vegas nevada which exposes us to certain risks such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts and from the expansion of gaming in the united states generally  key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts are            gaming revenue indicators table games drop and slots handle volume indicators win or hold percentage which is not fully controllable by us our normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 18 to 22 of table games drop and our normal slots hold percentage is in the range of 80 to 85 of slots handle and    37            hotel revenue indicators hotel occupancy a volume indicator average daily rate adr a price indicator and revenue per available room revpar a summary measure of hotel results combining adr and occupancy rate our calculation of adr which is the average price of occupied rooms per day includes the impact of complimentary rooms complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or cash rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis particularly to casino customers includes a disproportionate suite component the composite adr including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the adr for cash rooms reflecting the higher retail value of suites  mgm china on june 3 2011 we and ms ho pansy catilina chiu king ms pansy ho completed a reorganization of the capital structure and the initial public offering of 760 million shares of mgm china on the stock exchange of hong kong limited the ipo representing 20 of the post issuance base capital stock of mgm china at an offer price of hkd 1534 per share pursuant to this reorganization we acquired through a wholly owned subsidiary an additional 1 of the overall capital stock of mgm china for hkd 1534 per share or approximately 75 million and thereby became the owner of 51 of mgm china following the ipo the underwriters exercised their overallotment rights with respect to 59 million shares mgm china owns mgm grand paradise the macau company that owns the mgm macau and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions and is in the process of developing a gaming resort in cotai see below for additional information about the cotai development project  through the acquisition of the additional 1 interest of mgm china we obtained a controlling interest and were required to consolidate mgm china as of june 3 2011 prior to the ipo we held a 50 interest in mgm grand paradise which was accounted for under the equity method the acquisition of the controlling financial interest was accounted for as a business combination and we recognized 100 of the assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests of mgm china at fair value at the date of acquisition the fair value of the equity of mgm china was determined by the ipo transaction price and equaled approximately 75 billion the carrying value of our equity method investment was significantly less than our share of the fair value of mgm china resulting in a 35 billion gain on the acquisition  we believe our investment in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability asia is the fastestgrowing gaming market in the world and macau is the worlds largest gaming destination in terms of revenue  in october 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of macau to develop a resort and casino on an approximately 178 acre site in cotai macau the land concession contract became effective when the macau government published the agreement in the official gazette of macau on january 9 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years the total land premium payable to the macau government for the land concession contract is approximately 161 million and is composed of a down payment and eight additional semiannual payments as of december 31 2013 mgm china had paid 71 million of the contract premium recorded within other longterm assets net in january 2014 mgm china paid the second semiannual payment of 15 million under the land concession contract including interest on the six remaining semiannual payments mgm china has approximately 88 million remaining payable for the land concession contract in addition mgm grand paradise is required to pay the macau government approximately 269000 per year in rent during the course of development of the land and approximately 681000 per year in rent once the development is completed the annual rent is subject to review by the macau government every five years under the terms of the land concession contract mgm grand paradise is required to complete the development of the land by january 2018 in october 2012 mgm china and mgm grand paradise as coborrowers successfully closed on a 20 billion amended and

project hired a general contractor and construction of the foundation commenced in 2013    38    revenues at mgm macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by inhouse vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through the use of gaming promoters gaming promoters introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau assist these customers with travel arrangements and extend gaming credit to these players in exchange for their services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of commission inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate the main floor gaming operation in macau is also referred to as the mass gaming operation mgm macau main floor operations primarily consist of walkin and day trip visitors unlike vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future  vip gaming at mgm macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips called rolling chips gaming promoters purchase these rolling chips from mgm macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players the rolling chips allow mgm macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters clients in order to determine vip gaming play gaming promoter commissions are based on either a percentage of actual win plus a monthly complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the rolling chip turnover their customers generate or a percentage of the rolling chip turnover plus discounted offerings on nongaming amenities the estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to vip customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense inhouse vip commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue  in addition to the key performance indicators used by our wholly owned domestic resorts mgm macau utilizes turnover which is the sum of rolling chip wagers won by mgm macau calculated as rolling chips purchased plus rolling chips exchanged less rolling chips returned turnover provides a basis for measuring vip casino win percentage win for vip gaming operations at mgm macau is in the range of 27 to 30 of turnover mgm macaus main floor normal table games

that will be located on the land underlying these buildings  other nevada land we own approximately 170 acres of land in jean nevada and owned approximately 89 acres in and around sloan nevada in 2013 we recorded an impairment charge of 20 million based on an estimated fair value of 24 million due to an increased probability of sale in which we did not believe it was likely that the carrying value of the land would be recovered fair value was determined based on recent indications from market participants in the fourth quarter of 2013 we sold the sloan land  investment in grand victoria at june 30 2013 we reviewed the carrying value of our grand victoria investment for impairment due to a higher than anticipated decline in operating results and loss of market share as a result of the opening of a new riverboat casino in the illinois market as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flows compared to the prior forecast we used a blended discounted cash flow analysis and guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair value from a market participants viewpoint key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capital expenditures a longterm growth rate of 2 and a discount rate of 11 key assumptions in the guideline public company method included business enterprise value multiples selected based on the range of multiples in the companys peer group as a result of the analysis we determined that it was necessary to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 37 million at june 30 2013 based on an estimated fair value of 170 million for our 50 interest we intend to and believe we will be able to retain our investment in grand victoria however due to the extent of the shortfall and our assessment of the uncertainty of fully recovering our investment we determined that the impairment was otherthantemporary  at june 30 2012 we reviewed the carrying value of our grand victoria investment for impairment due to a decrease in operating results at the property and the loss of market share as a result of the opening of a new riverboat casino in the illinois market as well as a

cash flow analysis borgatas 2012 operating results did not meet previous forecasts while 2012 results for borgata were significantly impacted by hurricane sandy management believed the challenging environment in atlantic city would continue and lowered 2013 estimates below what was previously forecasted additionally we used a longterm growth rate of 25 and a discount rate of 105 based on our assessment of risk associated with the estimated cash flows this analysis is sensitive to management assumptions and increases or decreases in these assumptions would have a material impact on the analysis  we determined that it was necessary to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge for our investment in borgata of 62 million as of december 31 2011 using an estimated fair value for our investment of 185 million based on a discounted cash flow analysis key assumptions in such analysis include managements estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capital expenditures an appropriate discount rate and longterm growth rate at the time there was significant uncertainty surrounding borgatas future operating results due primarily to the planned opening of a major new resort in the atlantic city market during 2012 and other additional competition expected in surrounding markets as a result for purposes of this analysis we reflected a decrease in forecasted cash flows in 2012 and 2013 additionally we used a longterm growth rate of 3 and a discount rate of 105 based on our assessment of risk associated with the estimated cash flows  las vegas strip land we own 335 acres on the north end of the las vegas strip which we have been holding for future development during 2012 we focused our development efforts on other jurisdictions which led to us reviewing our significant development land holdings for impairment indicators due to our focus on future development outside of the las vegas area we did not believe it was likely we would recover the carrying value of our 335 acres of land on the north end of the las vegas strip on an undiscounted basis therefore we recorded an impairment charge of 366 million as of december 31 2012 based on an estimated fair value of 214 million for the land we determined fair value of the land using a market approach based on an assessment of comparable land sales in las vegas adjusted for size and location factors based on comparisons to our land  atlantic city land we own two sites for a total of approximately 86 acres in atlantic city which we have been holding for future development we recorded an impairment charge of 167 million as of december 31 2012 based on an estimated fair value of 125 million for the land due to our focus on future development outside of atlantic city the deterioration the atlantic city market had experienced and the initial underperformance of a new resort that opened in 2012 we did not believe it was likely we would recover the carrying value of this land on an undiscounted basis we determined fair value of the land using a market approach based on assessment of comparable land sales in atlantic city adjusted for size and location factors based on comparisons to our land  investment in silver legacy we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge at december 31 2011 which decreased the carrying value of our investment in silver legacy to zero and ceased applying

at maturity and filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in may 2012 these notes were nonrecourse to us in november 2012 silver legacy completed a consensual plan of reorganization pursuant to which the holders of the senior secured notes received a combination of cash and new second lien notes concurrently silver legacy entered into an agreement for a new 70 million senior secured credit facility which provided for a portion of the exit financing associated with the plan of reorganization as part of the reorganization the partners invested 75 million each in the form of subordinated

carrying value of our circus circus reno longlived assets for impairment using revised operating forecasts developed by management for that resort in the third quarter of 2011 due to the then current and forecasted market conditions and results of operations through september 30 2011 being lower than previous forecasts we recorded a noncash impairment charge of    46     80 million in the third quarter of 2011 primarily related to a writedown of circus circus renos longlived assets our discounted cash flow analysis for circus circus reno included estimated future cash inflows from operations

federal state and foreign income taxes paid net of refunds    835       6982       172018      48    in 2013 no income tax benefit was recorded for domestic book losses because we provided a valuation allowance against such losses in addition our foreign jurisdiction book income is taxed at essentially a zero percent tax rate due primarily to the exemption from macaus 12 complementary tax on gaming profits consequently absent nonrecurring taxation events our effective tax rate would have been approximately 5 in 2013 however due primarily to tax expense resulting from remeasuring the macau net deferred tax liability due to the extension of the amortization period of the mgm china gaming subconcession upon effectiveness of the cotai land concession offset in part by tax benefit resulting from audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitation the effective tax rate for 2013 approximated the 35 us statutory rate the income tax benefit on pretax loss in 2012 was substantially below the 35 statutory rate due primarily to the fact that we began recording a valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets during the year we recorded an income tax benefit in 2011 even though we had pretax income for the year because we did not provide us deferred taxes on the 35 billion gain recorded on the acquisition of the controlling financial interest in mgm china excluding the mgm china gain we would have provided income tax benefit at an effective tax rate of 607 for 2011 higher than the federal statutory rate due primarily to an income tax benefit resulting from a decrease to the macau net deferred tax liability recorded to reflect an assumed fiveyear extension of the exemption from complementary tax on gaming profits and a lower effective tax rate on mgm china earnings  cash taxes paid in 2013 and 2012 consisted primarily of foreign and state taxes the net refund of cash taxes in 2011 was due primarily to the carryback to prior years of us federal income tax net operating losses incurred in 2010 and 2009 respectively all us net operating loss carryback refund potential was realized as a result of these carrybacks and tax net operating losses

property transactions net and the gain on the mgm china transaction adjusted property ebitda is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the mgm resorts stock option plan which is not allocated to each property mgm china recognizes stock compensation expense related to its stock compensation plan which is included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for mgm china adjusted ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes these measures are 1 widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industry and 2 a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects property transactions net includes normal recurring disposals gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period in addition capital allocation tax planning financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level therefore we use adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of wholly owned domestic resorts operating performance  adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments    49     taxes and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries

maturing and an estimated 823 million of cash interest payments based on current outstanding debt and applicable interest rates within the next twelve months  in addition we expect to make the following capital investments during 2014            350 million in capital expenditures at our wholly owned domestic resorts and corporate entities          75 million for our arena joint venture subject to the joint venture obtaining permanent financing          170 million on capital expenditures including land costs related to the mgm national harbor project and          if we are awarded the license in massachusetts 225 million including an initial license fee construction costs including an initial deposit and land acquisition costs    56    during 2014 mgm china expects to spend approximately 70 million in capital improvements at mgm macau and 500 million on the mgm cotai project excluding capitalized interest and land  our capital expenditures fluctuate depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts and the timing of capital investments to maintain the quality of our resorts the amounts of which can vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms future capital expenditures could vary from our current expectations depending on the progress of our development efforts and the structure of our ownership interests in future developments  cotai land concession in october 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government for its planned development in cotai the land concession contract became effective on january 9 2013 when the macau government published it in the official gazette of macau and has an initial term of 25 years the land premium payable to the macau government for the land concession contract is 161 million and is composed of a down payment and eight additional semiannual payments as of december 31 2013 mgm china had paid 71 million of the contract premium recorded within other longterm assets net in january 2014 mgm china paid the second semiannual payment of 15 million under the land concession contract including interest on the six remaining semiannual payments mgm china has 88 million remaining payable for the land concession contract in addition mgm grand paradise is required to pay the macau government 269000 per year in rent during the course of development of the land and 681000 per year in rent once the development is completed the annual rent is subject to review by the macau government every five years mgm china has made significant progress in getting its construction team in place as well as finalizing its designs under the terms of the land concession contract mgm grand paradise is required to complete the development of the land within 60 months from the date of publication  mgm china dividend policy in february 2013 mgm china adopted a distribution policy pursuant to which it may make semiannual distributions in an aggregate amount per year not to exceed 35 of its anticipated consolidated annual profits in accordance with the policy mgm china may also declare special distributions from time to time the determination to make distributions will be made at the discretion of the mgm china board of directors and will be based upon mgm chinas operations and earnings development pipeline cash flows financial condition capital and other reserve requirements and surplus general financial conditions contractual restrictions including restrictions on its ability to pay dividends or distributions in the mgm china credit facility and any other conditions or factors which the board of directors deems relevant as a result there can be no assurance that distributions will be declared in the future or the amount or timing of such distributions if any  on february 19 2014 as part of its regular dividend policy mgm chinas board of directors announced it will recommend a final dividend for 2013 of 128 million to mgm china shareholders subject to approval at the 2014 annual shareholders meeting in addition mgm chinas board of directors announced a special dividend of 500 million which will be paid to shareholders of record as of march 10 2014 and distributed on or about march 17 2014 we will receive 255 million representing our 51 share of the special dividend  citycenter completion guarantee in october 2013 we entered into a third amended and restated completion and cost overrun guarantee which is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of circus circus las vegas as well as certain undeveloped land adjacent to that property the terms of the amended and restated completion guarantee provide citycenter the ability to utilize up to 72 million of net residential proceeds to fund construction costs or to reimburse us for construction costs previously expended as of december 31 2013 citycenter is holding approximately 72 million in a separate bank account representing the remaining condo proceeds available to fund completion guarantee obligations or be reimbursed to us in accordance with the amended and restated completion guarantee such amounts can only be used to fund construction lien obligations or reimbursed to us once the perini litigation is settled  as of december 31 2013 we had funded 716 million under the completion guarantee and have accrued a liability of 97 million which includes estimated litigation costs related to the resolution of disputes with contractors concerning the final construction costs and estimated amounts to be paid to contractors through the    57     legal process related to the perini litigation we do not believe it is reasonably possible we could be liable for amounts in excess of what we have accrued our estimated obligation has been offset by 72 million of condominium proceeds received by citycenter which are available to fund construction lien claims upon the resolution of the perini litigation also our accrual reflects certain estimated offsets to the amounts claimed by the contractors moreover we have not accrued for any contingent payments to citycenter related to the harmon component which will not be completed using the building as it now stands see note 11 in the accompanying financial statements for discussion of the status of the harmon  we do not believe we would be responsible for funding under the completion guarantee any additional remediation efforts that might be required with respect to the harmon however our view is based on a number of developing factors including with respect to ongoing litigation with citycenters contractors actions by local officials and other developments related to the citycenter venture all of which are subject to change  principal debt arrangements  our longterm debt consists of publicly held senior senior subordinated and convertible senior notes and our senior secured credit facility at december 31 2013 excluding mgm china we had 129 billion principal amount of indebtedness including 28 billion of borrowings outstanding under our

in each year beginning with 2013 with unused amounts in any fiscal year rolling over to the next fiscal year but not any fiscal year thereafter we were within the limit of 500 million of capital expenditures for the calendar year 2013 in addition our senior secured credit facility limits our ability to make investments subject to certain thresholds and other important exceptions we believe we

and a 145 billion revolving credit facility due october 2017 the outstanding balance at december 31 2013 of 553 million was comprised solely of term loans the interest rate on the facility fluctuates annually based on hibor plus a margin which ranges between 175 and 25 based on mgm chinas leverage ratio mgm china is a joint and several coborrower with mgm grand paradise the material subsidiaries of mgm china guarantee the facilities and mgm china mgm grand paradise and their guarantor subsidiaries have granted a security interest still subject to approval on substantially all of their assets to secure the amended facilities the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes and for the development of the cotai project  the mgm china credit facility agreement contains customary representations and warranties events of default affirmative covenants and negative covenants which impose restrictions on among other things the ability of mgm china and its subsidiaries to

facility covenants at december 31 2013  off balance sheet arrangements  our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates which consist primarily of our investments in citycenter grand victoria and silver legacy we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a fullscale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment we have not historically guaranteed financing obtained by our investees and there are no other provisions of the venture agreements which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of

amounts and expected maturities of debt outstanding at december 31 2013 and managements forecasted libor rates for our senior credit facility and hibor rates for the mgm grand paradise credit facility    2  approximately 75 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and other tax liabilities are excluded from the table as we cannot reasonably estimate when examination and other activity related to these amounts will conclude or when these amounts will be paid    3  under our completion guarantee for citycenter we are committed to fund amounts in excess of currently funded project costs based on current forecasted expenditures we estimate that we will be required to fund approximately 97 million for such guarantee    4  the amount for 2014 includes approximately 500 million of a total of 13 billion of construction commitments related to mgm cotai 115 million related to employment agreements 102 million for entertainment agreements and 38 million of open purchase orders other commitments include various contracted amounts including information technology advertising maintenance and other service agreements our largest entertainment commitments consist of minimum contractual payments to cirque du soleil which performs shows at several of our resorts our contractual commitments for these shows generally do not exceed 12 months and are based on our ability to exercise certain termination rights however we expect these shows to continue for longer periods  while we have significant indebtedness we believe we have the ability to meet known obligations including principal and interest obligations as well as planned capital expenditures over the next few years with cash flows from operations and availability under our senior credit facility we have 537 million of maturities of longterm debt in 2014 and the price per share of our common stock as of december 31 2013 was above the conversion price of our 145 billion 425 convertible senior notes due 2015 see liquidity and capital resources  other factors affecting liquidity for further discussion of anticipated uses of cash  critical accounting policies and estimates  managements discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates however by their nature judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates    60    business combinations  we accounted for our acquisition of mgm china in june 2011 as a business combination and have historically had significant acquisitions accounted for as business combinations in a business combination we determine the fair value of acquired assets including identifiable intangible assets assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests the fair value of the acquired business is allocated to the acquired assets assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests based on their fair value with any remaining fair value allocated to goodwill this allocation process requires use of estimates and assumptions including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets identifiable finitelife intangible assets such as certain license rights and customer lists are amortized over the intangible assets estimated useful life the method of amortization reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed if determinable normally estimated based on estimated future cash flows of the intangible asset goodwill as well as other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment as discussed further below  allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable  marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts in addition mgm china extends credit to certain inhouse vip gaming customers and gaming promoters our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau at december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 31 and 27 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states at december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 57 and 63 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability among other factors when we issue credit to customers who are not residents of the united states  we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customers financial condition collection history and any other known information we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate  in addition to enforceability issues the collectibility of unpaid markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a regions economy occur    61    the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables                    at december 31        2013     2012        in thousands     casino receivables     309620        294312      allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable     73081        90452      allowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable     24        31     percentage of casino accounts outstanding over 180 days     16        23    approximately 78 million of casino receivables and 4 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31 2013 the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has decreased in the current year due primarily to strong collections which resulted in a decrease in the aging of accounts at december 31 2013 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by 3 million  fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies  property and equipment are stated at cost for the majority of our property and equipment cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated fair values in connection with the june 2011 mgm china acquisition the april 2005 mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period  we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment in addition our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively  impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets  we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as a held for sale or b to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset for operating assets fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are    62     discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses  there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates  on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results negative industry or economic factors significant changes to our operating environment or changes in intended use of the asset group we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group including potential sale historically undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin  we review indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach and trademarks which are tested for impairment using the relieffromroyalty method goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group with the exception of the impairment of goodwill attributed to railroad pass in 2011 none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2013 2012 or 2011 as of the date we completed our 2013 goodwill impairment analysis the estimated fair values of our reporting units with associated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying values as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge  there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the determination of capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions  see operating results  details of certain charges for further discussion of write downs and impairments of longlived assets  impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates  we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in value if such conditions exist we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is otherthantemporary based on our assessment of relevant factors including consideration of our intent and ability to retain    63     our investment we estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates and a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group see operating results  details of certain charges for discussion of otherthantemporary impairment charges  income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied given the negative impact of the us economy on the results of operations in the past several years we no longer rely on future domestic operating income in assessing the realizability of our domestic deferred tax assets and now rely only on the future reversal of existing domestic taxable temporary differences as of december 31 2013 the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal deductible temporary differences exceeds the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal taxable temporary differences and we provide a valuation allowance for this excess at december 31 2013 such valuation allowance was 165 billion in addition there is a 16 million valuation allowance after federal effect provided on certain state deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of 56 million on certain macau deferred tax assets because we believe these assets do not meet the more likely than not criteria for recognition  our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities  we assess our tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a more likely than not threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current in other accrued liabilities or longterm in other longterm liabilities based on the time until expected payment additionally we recognize accrued interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material  as of december 31 2013 we are no longer subject to examination of our us consolidated federal income tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2005 the irs completed its examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2003 and 2004 tax years during 2010 and we paid 12 million in tax and 4 million in associated interest with respect to adjustments to which we agreed and protested with irs appeals issues to which we did not agree we favorably settled during the first quarter of 2013 all issues on appeal with irs appeals resulting in a refund of 2 million including interest during the fourth quarter of 2010 the irs opened an examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2005 through 2009 tax years the irs completed its examination during 2013 and we have tentatively agreed to all proposed adjustments this agreement is subject to final approval from the joint committee on taxation and the examination will not be considered settled until such approval is received which we anticipate will occur in the next twelve months we deposited 30 million with the irs to cover the expected cash taxes and interest resulting from the tentatively agreed adjustments for this examination and the examinations discussed below  during the first quarter of 2011 the irs opened examinations of the 2007 through 2008 tax years of citycenter holdings llc an unconsolidated affiliate treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and the 2008 through 2009 tax years of mgm grand detroit llc a subsidiary treated as a partnership for income tax purposes the irs completed these examinations in 2013 and we agreed to all proposed adjustments the impact of these adjustments is included in the 30 million deposit described above    64    during the fourth quarter of 2010 we and our joint venture partner reached tentative settlement with irs appeals with respect to the audit of the 2003 and 2004 tax years of a cost method investee of ours that is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes the adjustments to which we agreed in such tentative settlement were included in the final settlement we reached with irs appeals with respect to the 2003 and 2004 examination of our consolidated federal income tax return the irs completed during 2013 its examination of the 2005 through 2009 tax years of this

value of sharebased compensation and consequently the related amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements the extent of the impact will depend in part on the extent of awards in any given year  market risk  in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations we are also exposed to additional market risks market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions  as of december 31 2013 longterm variable rate borrowings represented approximately 25 of our total borrowings assuming a 100 basispoint increase in libor in the case of term loan b over the 1 floor specified in our senior credit facility our annual interest cost would change by approximately 28 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31 2013 assuming a 100 basispoint increase in hibor for the mgm grand paradise credit facility our annual

disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates  fair value measurements fair value measurements affect the companys accounting and impairment assessments of its longlived assets investments in unconsolidated affiliates cost method investments assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition and goodwill and other intangible assets fair value measurements also affect the companys accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the

at cost accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the companys receivables to their net carrying amount which approximates fair value the allowance is estimated based on specific review of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions management believes that as of december 31 2013 no significant concentrations of credit risk existed for which an

several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets held for sale the company recognizes the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs to sell as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used the company reviews for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist the company then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset typically measured using a discounted cash flow model if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses see note 16 for information on recorded impairment charges    92    capitalized interest the interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is

carrying value of its investment may have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in value if such conditions exist the company compares the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine if an impairment is indicated and determines whether the impairment is otherthantemporary based on its assessment of all relevant factors including consideration of the companys intent and ability to retain its investment the company estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates and a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the companys peer group see note 6 for results of the companys

discount rates and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates and a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the companys peer group the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities and the amount remaining if any is the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value then it must be written down to its implied fair value license rights are tested for impairment using a discounted    93     cash flow approach and trademarks are tested for impairment using the relieffromroyalty

generated from gaming operations of mgm grand paradise which is wholly owned by mgm china is exempted from macaus 12 complementary tax for the fiveyear period ending december 31 2016 pursuant to approval from the macau government granted on september 22 2011 absent this exemption net income attributable to mgm resorts international would have been reduced by 43 million and 34 million for 2013 and 2012 respectively and net income per share diluted would have been reduced by 009 and 007 for 2013 and 2012 respectively the approval granted in 2011 represented the second fiveyear exemption period granted to mgm grand paradise the company measures the net deferred tax liability of mgm grand paradise under the assumption that it will receive an additional fiveyear exemption beyond 2016 such assumption is based upon the granting of a third fiveyear exemption to a competitor of mgm grand paradise the company    109     believes mgm grand paradise should also be entitled to a third fiveyear exemption in order to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment among gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires a requirement under macanese law the net deferred tax liability of mgm grand paradise was remeasured during the first quarter of 2013 due to the extension of the amortization period of the macau gaming subconcession in connection with the effectiveness of the cotai land concession this resulted in an increase in the net deferred tax liability and a corresponding increase in provision for income taxes of 65 million in 2013  nongaming operations remain subject to the macau complementary tax mgm grand paradise had at december 31 2013 a complementary tax net operating loss carryforward of 459 million resulting from nongaming operations that will expire if not utilized against nongaming income in years 2014 through 2016 the macanese net operating loss carryforwards are fully offset by a valuation allowance  mgm grand paradises exemption from the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits does not apply to dividend distributions of such profits to mgm china however in june 2012 mgm grand paradise reached an agreement with the macau government to settle the 12 complementary tax that would otherwise be due by its shareholders including mgm china on distributions of its gaming profits by paying a flat annual payment annual fee arrangement regardless of the amount of distributable dividends such annual fee arrangement covered the years 2007 through 2011 including a distribution that was made during the first quarter of 2012 the covered period cumulative annual payments of 4 million for the covered period were paid and a corresponding reduction to benefit for income taxes was recorded in 2012 shareholders of mgm grand paradise are not subject to the complementary tax on distributions they received during the covered period as a result of the annual fee arrangement consequently the company reversed complementary taxes previously accrued on such distributions resulting in a 19 million increase to benefit for income taxes in 2012 mgm grand paradise submitted a request for a fiveyear extension of the annual fee arrangement covering all years through 2016 extended annual fee arrangement which was approved by the macau government in december 2012 annual payments of 2 million are required under the extended annual fee arrangement the 2 million annual payment for 2013 and 2012 was accrued and a corresponding provision for income taxes was recorded in each year  the company repatriated 312 and 263 million of foreign earnings and profits in 2013 and 2012 respectively at december 31 2013 there are approximately 282 million of unrepatriated foreign earnings and profits all of which the company anticipates will be repatriated in 2014 without the incurrence of additional us income tax expense accordingly no deferred tax liability has been recorded for those earnings creditable foreign taxes associated with the repatriated earnings and profits increased the companys foreign tax credit carryover by 968 million and 785 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively such foreign taxes consist of the macau special gaming tax which the company believes qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against us income taxes the foreign tax credit carryovers expire as follows 2 million in 2015 785 million in 2022 and 968 million in 2023 the foreign tax credit carryovers are subject to valuation allowance as described further below  the company has a us federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of 808 million that will begin to expire in 2031 an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of 24 million that will not expire a general business tax credit carryforward of 17 million that will begin to expire in 2029 and a charitable contribution carryforward of 12 million of which 3 million will expire in 2014 and the remainder thereafter  at december 31 2013 the company is not close to the 50 ownership change threshold set forth in internal revenue code section 382 should the 50 ownership change threshold be exceeded in a future period the companys us federal income tax net operating losses and tax credits incurred prior to the ownership change would generally be subject to a postchange annual usage limitation equal to the value of the company at the time of the ownership change multiplied by the longterm tax exempt rate at such time as established by the internal revenue service  for state income tax purposes the company has illinois and new jersey net operating loss carryforwards of 80 million and 231 million respectively which equates to deferred tax assets after federal tax effect and    110     before valuation allowance of 4 million and 14 million respectively the illinois net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2021 through 2025 the new jersey net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2014 through 2033  during 2011 the state of michigan enacted changes in its corporate tax law that became effective on january 1 2012 the state replaced the michigan business tax mbt regime with a new corporate income tax cit regime that taxes unitary combined income apportioned to the state at a 6 rate net operating loss carryforwards generated under the mbt of which the company had 198 million at december 31 2011 may not be carried over and utilized under the cit losses generated under the cit will have a 10 year carryforward period furthermore the booktax difference deduction which would have been available under the mbt in 2015 through 2029 is not available under the cit during 2011 the company recorded an increase to the net michigan deferred tax liability in the amount of 8 million after federal effect to reflect the impact of this tax law change with a corresponding reduction to income tax benefit  given the negative impact of the us economy on the results of operations in the past several years the company no longer relies on future domestic operating income in assessing the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets and now relies only on the future reversal of existing domestic taxable temporary differences as of december 31 2013 the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal deductible temporary differences exceeds the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal taxable temporary differences and a valuation allowance is provided for this excess at december 31 2013 such valuation allowance was 165 billion in addition there is a 16 million valuation allowance after federal effect provided on certain state deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of 56 million on certain macau deferred tax assets because the company believes these assets do not meet the more likely than not criteria for recognition  the company assesses its tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a more likely than not threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities recorded as a result of this analysis must generally be recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and at december 31 2013 the company has classified 16 million as current in other accrued liabilities and 87 million as longterm in other longterm obligations based on the time until expected payment  a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows                        year ended december 31        2013     2012     2011        in thousands     gross unrecognized tax benefits at january 1     153184        145799

was 32 million and 39 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively of these amounts unrecognized tax benefits related to permanent differences of 6 million at both december 31 2013 and 2012 that would otherwise impact the effective tax rate would not impact the effective tax rate if recognized in years when the company has a valuation allowance provided against its us federal deferred tax assets  the company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense the company had 17 million and 29 million in interest related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued    111     at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively no amounts were accrued for penalties as of either date income tax expense for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011

   citycenter construction litigation in march 2010 perini building company inc perini general contractor for citycenter filed a lawsuit in the eighth judicial district court for clark county state of nevada against mgm mirage design group a wholly owned subsidiary of the company which was the original party to the perini construction agreement and certain direct or indirect subsidiaries of citycenter holdings llc the citycenter owners perini asserted that citycenter was substantially completed but the defendants failed to pay perini approximately 490 million allegedly due and owing under the construction agreement for labor equipment and materials expended on citycenter the complaint further charged the defendants with failure to provide timely and complete design documents late delivery to perini of design changes mismanagement of the change order process obstruction of perinis ability to complete the harmon component and fraudulent inducement of perini to compromise significant amounts due for its general conditions the complaint advanced claims for breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel and fraud and intentional misrepresentation perini seeks compensatory damages punitive damages attorneys fees and costs  in april 2010 perini served an amended complaint in this case which joins as defendants many owners of citycenter residential condominium units the condo owner defendants added a count for foreclosure of perinis recorded master mechanics lien against the citycenter property in the amount of approximately 491 million and asserted the priority of this mechanics lien over the interests of the citycenter owners the condo owner defendants and citycenter lenders in the citycenter property  the citycenter owners and the other defendants dispute perinis allegations and contend that the defendants are entitled to substantial amounts from perini including offsets against amounts claimed to be owed to perini and its subcontractors and damages based on breach of their contractual and other duties to citycenter duplicative payment requests nonconforming work lack of proof of alleged work performance defective work related to the harmon property damage and perinis failure to perform its obligations to pay certain subcontractors and to prevent filing of liens against citycenter parallel to the court litigation citycenter management conducted an extrajudicial program for settlement of citycenter subcontractor claims citycenter has resolved the claims of 219 firsttier perini subcontractors including the claims of any lowertier subcontractors that might have claims through those firsttier subcontractors with only three remaining for further proceedings along with trial of perinis claims and citycenters harmonrelated counterclaim and other claims by citycenter against perini and its parent guarantor tutor perini two of the remaining subcontractors are implicated in the defective work at the harmon in august 2013 perini recorded an amended notice of lien reducing its lien to approximately 167 million  in november 2012 perini filed a second amended complaint which among other things added claims against the citycenter defendants of breach of contract alleging that citycenters owner controlled insurance program ocip failed to provide adequate project insurance for perini with broad coverages and high limits and tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing alleging improper administration by citycenter of the ocip and builders risk insurance programs citycenter reached a settlement agreement with certain professional service providers against whom it had asserted claims in this litigation for errors or omissions with respect to the citycenter project which settlement has been approved by the court further citycenter and perini have entered a settlement agreement which resolves most but not all of the components of perinis nonharmonrelated lien claim against citycenter pursuant to the parties stipulation on february 24 2014 perini filed a revised lien for 174 million as the amount claimed by perini and the remaining harmonrelated subcontractors trial of the remainder of perinis lien claim the remaining subcontractors claims against citycenter and citycenters counterclaims against perini and certain subcontractors for defective work at the harmon has been rescheduled to commence on september 23 2014  citycenter owners and the other defendants will continue to vigorously assert and protect their interests in the perini lawsuit the company believes it is probable that the citycenter owners and the other defendants will    114     be liable for 152 million in connection with the nonharmon settlement agreement and remaining claims in this lawsuit amounts determined to be owed would be funded in part under the companys completion guarantee which is discussed below the company does not believe it is reasonably possible it will be liable for any material amount in excess of its estimate of its probable liability the companys estimate of its probable liability does not include any offset for amounts that may be recovered on its counterclaims against perini and certain subcontractors for defective work at the harmon  please see below for further discussion on the companys completion guarantee obligation which may be impacted by the outcome of the above litigation and the joint ventures extrajudicial settlement process  citycenter completion guarantee in october 2013 the company entered into a third amended and restated completion and cost overrun guarantee which is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of circus circus las vegas as well as certain undeveloped land adjacent to that property the terms of the amended and restated completion guarantee provide citycenter the ability to utilize up to 72 million of net residential proceeds to fund construction costs or to reimburse the company for construction costs previously expended as of december 31 2013 citycenter is holding approximately 72 million in a separate bank account representing the remaining condo proceeds available to fund completion guarantee obligations or be reimbursed to the company in accordance with the amended and restated completion guarantee such amounts may only be used to fund construction lien obligations or to reimburse the company once the perini litigation is settled  as of december 31 2013 the company has funded 716 million under the completion guarantee and has accrued a liability of 97 million which includes estimated litigation costs related to the resolution of disputes with contractors concerning the final construction costs and estimated amounts to be paid to contractors through the legal process related to the perini litigation the company does not believe it is reasonably possible it could be liable for amounts in excess of what it has accrued the companys estimated obligation has been offset by the 72 million of condominium proceeds received and held in escrow by citycenter which are available to fund construction lien claims upon the resolution of the perini litigation also the companys accrual reflects certain estimated offsets to the amounts claimed by the contractors moreover the company has not accrued for any contingent payments to citycenter related to the harmon component  harmon demolition in response to a request by the clark county building division the building division citycenter engaged an engineer to conduct an analysis based on all available information as to the structural stability of the harmon under buildingcodespecified load combinations on july 11 2011 that engineer submitted the results of his analysis of the harmon tower and podium in its current asbuilt condition the engineer opined among other things that in a codelevel earthquake using either the permitted or current code specified loads it is likely that critical structural members in the tower will fail and become incapable of supporting gravity loads leading to a partial or complete collapse of the tower there is missing or misplaced reinforcing steel in columns beams shear walls and transfer walls throughout the structure of the tower below the twentyfirst floor based on this engineering opinion the building division requested a plan of action from citycenter citycenter informed the building division that it decided to abate the potential for structural collapse of the harmon in the event of a codelevel earthquake by demolishing the building and enclosed a plan of action for demolition by implosion prepared by lvi environmental services of nevada inc lvi citycenter also advised that prior to undertaking the demolition plan of action it would seek relief from a standing order of the district court judge presiding over the perini litigation that prohibits alteration or destruction of the building without court approval in addition citycenter supplied the foundational data for the engineering conclusions stated in the july 11 2011 letter declaring the harmons structural instability in the event of a codelevel earthquake on november 22 2011 the building division required that citycenter submit a plan to abate the code deficiencies discovered in the harmon tower  in december 2011 citycenter resubmitted to the building division the plan of abatement action prepared by lvi which was first submitted on august 15 2011 and met with the building division about the requirements necessary to obtain demolition permits and approvals as discussed above the timing of the demolition of the harmon is subject to rulings in the perini litigation    115    the district court presiding over the perini litigation had previously granted citycenters motion to demolish the harmon but stayed the demolition to allow citycenter an opportunity to conduct additional phase 4 destructive testing at the harmon following the courts order prohibiting citycenters structural engineering expert from extrapolating the results of prephase 4 testing to untested portions of the building  in may 2013 citycenter completed additional phase 4 destructive testing of 468 structural elements at the harmon analysis of which data confirmed the existence of a wide variety of construction defects throughout the harmon tower in his june 2013 expert report citycenters structural engineer opined that the additional test results and extrapolation thereof to untested portions of the building show that after a servicelevel earthquake typically defined as an earthquake with a 50 chance of occurring in 30 years the harmon can be expected to sustain extensive damage and failure of many structural elements and in a large earthquake such as a building codelevel earthquake critical elements of the harmon are likely to fail and lead to a partial or complete collapse of the tower in april 2013 perinis structural engineering expert john a martin amp associates jama had sent a letter to the building division which declared in part that jama no longer believes that the harmon tower can be repaired to a code compliant structure which condition jama attributed to citycenters building testing on july 18 2013 citycenter filed a renewed motion with the district court for permission to demolish the harmon on august 23 2013 the court granted citycenters motion and citycenter has commenced planning for demolition of the building on january 31 2014 the court revoked its prior authorization of demolition of the harmon without prejudice to renewal of the application on the grounds that citycenters nonparty builders risk insurer requested further testing in the building  the company does not believe it would be responsible for funding any additional remediation efforts under the completion guarantee that might be required with respect to the harmon however the companys view is based on a number of developing factors including with respect to ongoing litigation with citycenters contractors actions by local officials and other developments related to the citycenter venture all of which are subject to change  sales and use tax on complimentary meals in march 2008 the nevada supreme court ruled in a case involving another gaming company that food and nonalcoholic beverages purchased for use in providing complimentary meals to customers and to employees were exempt from use tax the company had previously paid use tax on these items and had generally filed for refunds for the periods from january 2001 to february 2008 related to this matter which refunds had not been paid the company claimed the exemption on sales and use tax returns for periods after february 2008 in light of this nevada supreme court decision and had not accrued or paid any sales or use tax for those periods in february 2012 the nevada department of taxation asserted that customer complimentary meals and employee meals were subject to sales tax on a prospective basis commencing february 15 2012 in july 2012 the nevada department of taxation announced that sales taxes applicable to such meals would be due and payable without penalty or interest at the earlier of certain regulatory judicial or legislative events or june 30 2013 the nevada department of taxations position stemmed from a nevada tax commission decision concerning another gaming company which stated that complimentary meals provided to customers are subject to sales tax at the retail value of the meal and employee meals are subject to sales tax at the cost of the meal the clark county district court subsequently issued a ruling in such case that held that complementary meals provided to customers were subject to sales tax while meals provided to employees were not subject to sales tax this decision was appealed to the nevada supreme court  in june 2013 the company and other similarly situated companies entered into a global settlement agreement with the nevada department of taxation that when combined with the contemporaneous passage of legislation governing the prospective treatment of complimentary meals ab 506 resolved all matters concerning the prior and future taxability of such meals ab 506 provides that complimentary meals provided to customers and employees after the effective date of the bill are not subject to either sales or use tax under the terms of the global settlement the company agreed to withdraw its refund requests and the nevada department of tax agreed to drop its assertion that sales tax was due on such meals up to the effective date of ab 506 since the company did not previously accrue either the claims for refund of use taxes or any liability for sales taxes    116     that the nevada department of tax may have asserted prior to entering the global settlement agreement there is no financial statement impact of entering into the settlement agreement  other guarantees the company is party to various guarantee contracts in the normal course of business which are generally supported by letters of credit issued by financial institutions the companys senior credit facility limits the amount of letters of credit that can be issued to 500 million and the amount of available borrowings under the senior credit facility is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2013 the company had provided 35 million of total letters of credit at december 31 2013 mgm china had provided approximately 39 million of guarantees under its credit facility  other litigation the company is a party to various legal proceedings most of which relate to routine matters incidental to its business management does not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position
