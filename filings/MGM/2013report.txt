based on the regions in which we operate wholly owned domestic resorts and mgm china we currently operate 15 wholly owned resorts in the united states mgm chinas operations consist of the mgm macau resort and casino we have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates our mgm hospitality operations and certain other corporate and management operations the citycenter joint venture citycenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate which we also manage for a fee see resort operations below as well as the segment footnote in the accompanying financial statements for additional information related to our segments   resort operations    general    our casino resorts offer gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities most of our revenue is essentially cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financings fund capital expenditures and provide excess cash flow for future development we have historically made significant investments in our resorts through the addition of new restaurants entertainment nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities in  1      addition we have made regular capital investments to maintain the quality of our hotel rooms and public spaces   we believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate as discussed above ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests the quality of our resorts and amenities can be measured by our success in winning numerous awards both domestic and globally such as several four and five diamond designations from the american automobile association four and five star designations from mobil travel and forbes travel guide four star awards   our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend gaming customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year while our results do not depend on key individual customers a significant portion of our operating income is generated from highend gaming customers which can cause variability in our results in addition our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a country or region can affect our results   all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of grand victoria which operates 22 hours a day every day of the year at our wholly owned domestic resorts our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we generally have an operating philosophy that favors ownership and management of amenities since guests have direct contact with staff in these areas and we prefer to control all aspects of the guest experience however we do lease space to retail and food and beverage operators particularly for branding opportunities and when capital investment by us is not desirable or feasible we also operate many managed outlets utilizing thirdparty management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants and nightclubs  2        our operating resorts    we have provided

local partners have an ownership interest of approximately 3 of mgm grand detroit    more detailed information about each of our operating resorts can be found in exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference   wholly owned domestic resorts over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities our significant convention and meeting facilities allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower  3      leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities we market to different customer segments to manage our hotel occupancy such as targeting large conventions to increase midweek occupancy   our casino operations feature a variety of slots table games and race amp sports book wagering in addition we offer our premium players access to highlimit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere   mgm china on june 3 2011 we and ms ho pansy catilina chiu king ms pansy ho completed a reorganization of the capital structure of mgm china pursuant to which we acquired an additional 1 interest in mgm china and thereby became the owner of 51 of mgm china through the acquisition of the additional 1 interest of mgm china we obtained a controlling interest and were required to consolidate mgm china as of june 3 2011 prior to the transaction we held a 50 interest in mgm grand paradise sa mgm grand paradise which was accounted for under the equity method we believe our ownership interest in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability asia is the fastestgrowing gaming market in the world and macau is the worlds largest gaming destination in terms of revenue and has continued to grow over the past few years despite the global economic downturn   our current mgm china operations relate primarily to the mgm macau resort and casino mgm macau revenues at mgm macau are generated primarily from gaming operations made up of two distinct market segments main floor and highend vip mgm macau main floor operations consist of both table games and slot machines on the main gaming floors for the public which usually consists of walkin and day trip visitors vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by inhouse vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through gaming promoters also known as junket operators which introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau assist these customers with travel arrangements and extend gaming credit to these players   gaming operations at mgm macau are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by mgm grand paradise the macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession was granted by sociedade de jogos de macau sa sjm and expires in 2020 the macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations   on october 18 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of macau to develop a resort and casino on an approximately 178 acre site in cotai macau the land concession contract became effective when the macau government published the agreement in the official gazette of macau on january 9 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years the total land premium payable to the macau government for the land concession contract is approximately 161 million and is composed of a down payment and eight additional semiannual payments in october 2012 mgm china paid approximately 56 million as the initial down payment of the contract premium including interest on the eight semiannual payments mgm china has approximately 118 million remaining payable for the land concession contract in addition mgm grand paradise is required to pay the macau government approximately 269000 per year in rent during the course of development of the land and approximately 681000 per year in rent once the development is completed the annual rent is subject to review by the macau government every five years under the terms of the land concession contract mgm grand paradise is required to complete the development of the land by january 2018  4        customers and competition    our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments we compete against gaming companies as well as other hospitality companies in the markets we operate in neighboring markets and in other parts of the world including nongaming resort destinations such as hawaii and florida our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states and internationally   our primary methods of successful competition include   locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets constructing and maintaining highquality resorts and facilities including luxurious guestrooms stateoftheart convention facilities and premier dining entertainment retail and other amenities recruiting training and retaining wellqualified and motivated employees who provide superior and friendly customer service providing unique mustsee entertainment attractions and developing distinctive and memorable marketing promotional and customer loyalty programs    wholly owned domestic resorts our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the las vegas area including major hotel casinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotel casinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the strip and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority there were approximately 150500 guestrooms in las vegas at december 31 2012 and 150000 at december 31 2011 at december 31 2012 we operated approximately 27 of the guestrooms in las vegas las vegas visitor volume was 397 million in 2012 a 2 increase from the 389 million reported for 2011   the las vegas market includes leisure travel customers premium gaming customers convention customers including small meetings trade associations and corporate incentive programs and tour and travel customers our luxury wholly owned resorts including bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage appeal to the upper end of each market segment balancing their business by using the convention and tour and travel segments to fill the midweek and offpeak periods our marketing strategy for new yorknew york luxor and monte carlo is aimed at attracting middle to uppermiddleincome customers largely from the leisure travel and the tour and travel segments excalibur and circus circus las vegas generally cater to the valueoriented and middleincome leisure travel and tour and travel segments   outside las vegas our other nevada operations compete with each other and with many other similarly sized and larger operations our nevada resorts located outside of las vegas appeal primarily to the valueoriented leisure traveler and the valueoriented local customer a significant number of our customers at these resorts come from california   outside nevada our resorts primarily compete for customers in local and regional gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region for example in detroit michigan we compete with a casino in nearby windsor canada and with native american casinos in michigan in biloxi mississippi we compete with regional riverboat and landbased casinos in louisiana native american casinos in central mississippi and with casinos in florida and the bahamas   mgm china our key competitors in macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires if the macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we also encounter competition from major gaming centers located in  5      other areas of asia and around the world including singapore malaysia australia las vegas cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region   the two primary customer segments in the macau gaming market are vip and main floor vip gaming play is sourced both internally and externally externally sourced vip gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who offer vip players various services such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel food and beverage services external gaming promoters operate vip gaming rooms within the property we typically pay commissions to external gaming promoters based on gaming wins or losses we extend credit and provide complimentaries to our internally sourced vip clientele without the use of an intermediary these clientele are acquired through our direct marketing efforts   historically gaming operators in macau have mainly focused on vip players but we have increased our focus on the main floor segment the main floor segment includes both table games and slot machines played on the main gaming floors consisting mainly of walkin and daytrip visitors the main floor segment is the highest margin sector of the overall gaming market and exceeds the vip segment due to the latters commission costs to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we expect a larger portion of mgm macaus gaming revenues to come from the main floor segment in future periods   corporate and other aria which we manage and own 50 through the citycenter joint venture appeals to the upper end of each segment in the las vegas market and competes with our wholly owned luxury casino resorts and other luxury resorts on the las vegas strip our other unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers against casino resorts in their respective markets much like our wholly owned resorts our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts    marketing    our marketing efforts are conducted through various means including our loyalty programs as discussed further below we advertise on the radio television internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the united states and overseas as well as by direct mail and through the use of social media we also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major us and foreign cities a key element of marketing to premium gaming customers is personal contact by our marketing personnel direct marketing is also important in the convention segment we maintain websites to inform customers about our resorts and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms make restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets we actively utilize several social media sites to promote our brands unique events and special deals   wholly owned domestic resorts we introduced our loyalty program m life in 2010 m life is a

las vegas strip resorts our major las vegas resorts offer luxury suite packages that include golf privileges at shadow creek in north las vegas in connection with our marketing activities we also invite our premium gaming customers to play shadow creek on a complimentary basis additionally marketing efforts at beau rivage benefit from fallen oak golf course located 20 minutes north of beau

highest level vip cash players the structured rewards system based on member value and tiers ensures that customers can progressively access the full range of services that the resort provides the

profile   in addition to the golden lion club program the resort has also created and continues to expand several luxurious private gaming salons that provide a distinctive highend environment for the vip players brought to the resort through gaming promoters and the inhouse vip marketing team the resort has created a variety of incentive programs to reward gaming promoters for increased business and efficiency    employees and management    we believe that knowledgeable friendly and dedicated employees are a key success factor therefore we invest heavily in recruiting training motivating and retaining exceptional employees and we seek to hire and promote the strongest management team possible we have numerous programs both at the corporate and business unit level designed to achieve these objectives we believe our internal development programs such as the mgm resorts university and various leadership and management training programs are best in class among our industry peers    technology    we utilize various types of technology to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations we continue to move forward on standardizing the technology platforms for several of our key operational systems the standardization of these systems provides us with one consistent operating platform allowing us efficiencies in training reducing complexity in system integration and interfaces standardizing processes across our casino resorts and providing our customers with better information these systems capture charges made by our customers during their stay including allowing customers of our resorts to charge meals and services at our other resorts to their hotel accounts in addition we utilize yield management programs at many of our resorts that help us maximize occupancy and room rates   we continue to roll out our new booking engine which brings together and standardizes our domestic portfolio the booking engine allows our guests and business partners the ability to create an allinclusive experience from accommodations to dining to shows in addition guests will be able to share their vacation plans with others via social media available through all of our domestic resorts individual websites the booking engine gives guests the power to customize a complete itinerary from our full portfolio of experiences all in one place this experience is a significant improvement over traditional hotel booking engines which require guests to visit multiple sites for dining hotel and entertainment reservations the booking engine is also beneficial to m life members through full integration with wwwmlifecom with future plans to enable members to redeem express comps members will enjoy powerful benefits including easier access to their customized offers  7        corporate social responsibility    we seek to conduct our business in an effective socially responsible way while striving to maximize shareholder value our corporate social responsibility efforts are overseen by the corporate social responsibility committee of our board of directors   environmental sustainability we continue to gain recognition for our comprehensive environmental responsibility initiatives our resorts in nevada and michigan were the first to earn certification from green key the largest international program evaluating sustainable hotel operations we received certifications at 12 resorts including five green key the highest possible ratings at aria vdara and mandalay bay many major travel service providers recognize the green key designation and identify our resorts for their continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations   in addition we believe that incorporating the tenets of sustainability in our business decisions provides a platform for innovation and operational efficiency citycenter is one of the worlds largest private green developments with six leed gold certifications from the us green building council citycenter serves as a new standard for combining luxury and environmental responsibility within the largescale hospitality industry   we incorporate the same commitment to the environment at mgm macau our efforts to improve energy efficiency indoor air quality and environmental stewardship have resulted in mgm macau receiving the macau environmental protection bureaumacau green hotel award   diversity and inclusion our awardwinning diversity program is designed to identify and develop programs and practices that give sustainable life and momentum to diversity within our company and our suppliers the diversity initiative at our wholly owned domestic resorts focuses on the unique strengths of our individuals combined with a culture of collaborative teamwork to achieve greater performance our diversity program has been widely recognized and has been awarded numerous accolades   philanthropy and community engagement our community and social investments are prioritized to strengthen the communities where our employees live work and care for their families our community platform features three main programs our corporate giving program the employeefunded mgm resorts foundation and our employee volunteer program through these channels we make financial and inkind donations contribute volunteer service and participate in civic and nonprofit organizations that advance the quality of life in our communities key investment areas include basic human needs diversity education and health and wellness    internal controls    we have a strong culture of compliance driven by our history in the highly regulated gaming industry and our belief that compliance is a valueadded activity our system of internal controls and proceduresincluding internal control over financial reportingis designed to promote reliable and accurate financial records transparent disclosures compliance with laws and regulations and protection of our assets our internal controls start at the source of business transactions and we have rigorous enforcement at both the business unit and corporate level   we have a corporate internal audit function that performs regular reviews regarding gaming compliance internal controls over financial reporting and operations in addition we maintain an independent compliance committee that administers our companywide compliance plan the compliance plan is in place to promote compliance with gaming and other laws applicable to our operations in all jurisdictions including performing background investigations on our current and potential employees directors and vendors as well as thorough review of proposed transactions and associations although the corporate internal audit function and the companywide compliance plan are not applicable to mgm china which is a publicly traded subsidiary mgm china has its own internal audit group with similar  8      responsibilities and has established a compliance program at mgm macau that is modeled after our program   in connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our casinos we maintain stringent controls on the recording of all receipts and disbursements and other activities including cash transaction reporting which is essential in our industry our controls surrounding cash transactions include locked cash boxes on the casino floor daily cash counts performed by employees who are independent of casino operations constant observation and supervision of the gaming area observation and recording of gaming and other areas by closedcircuit television constant computer monitoring of our slot machines and timely analysis of deviations from expected performance   marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at our highend resorts our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at certain of those casinos as well we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to timely pay their marker balances these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices direct personal contact and the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation   in our us jurisdictions amounts owed for markers that are not timely paid are enforceable under state laws and all other states are required to enforce a judgment for amounts owed pursuant to the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution amounts owed for markers that are not timely paid are not legally enforceable in some foreign countries but the us assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the us of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from us courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations   furthermore we expect that mgm macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions including macau to the extent mgm macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions mgm macau may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because among other reasons courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm macau may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts moreover under applicable law mgm macau remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers   leveraging our brand and management assets   in allocating resources our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts spending on new resorts or initiatives and repaying longterm debt we believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide profitable returns although these decisions were significantly affected by economic conditions over the past several years when our access to capital was limited   we regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in both the domestic and international markets but cannot at this time determine the likelihood of proceeding with specific development opportunities opportunities we evaluate may include the ownership management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in nevada or in states

forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the us private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements can be identified by words such as anticipates intends plans seeks

significant cash flow amounts we will invest in capital expenditures amounts we will pay under the citycenter completion guarantee the opening of strategic resort developments and the amount we will

materially from those in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to regional national or global political economic business competitive market and regulatory conditions and the following   our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could adversely affect our development options and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations current and future economic and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service or refinance our indebtedness and to make planned expenditures and investments restrictions and limitations in the agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness could significantly affect our ability to operate our business as well as significantly affect our liquidity significant competition we face with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete the fact that our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations could adversely affect our business the impact on our business of economic and market conditions in the markets in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside restrictions on our ability to have any interest or involvement in gaming business in china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china the ability of the macau government to terminate mgm grand paradises gaming subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating mgm grand paradise or refuse to grant mgm grand paradise an extension of the subconcession which is scheduled to expire on march 31 2020 our ability to build and open our development in cotai by january 2018 the dependence of mgm macau upon gaming junket operators for a significant portion of gaming revenues in macau extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business   the concentration of our major gaming resorts on the las vegas strip the fact that we extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables the potential occurrence of impairments to goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets which could negatively affect future profits the susceptibility of leisure and business travel especially travel by air to global geopolitical events such as terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility the fact that investing through partnerships or joint ventures including citycenter decreases our ability to manage risk the fact that future construction or development projects will be susceptible to substantial development and construction risks the fact that our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future the fact that citycenter has decided to abate the potential for structural collapse of the harmon in the event of a codelevel earthquake by demolishing the building which exposes us to risks prior to or in connection with the demolition process the fact that a failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business the fact that tracinda corporation owns a significant amount of our common stock and may have interests that differ from the interests of other holders of our stock the risks associated with doing business outside of the united states and the impact of any potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or other similar anticorruption laws risks related to pending claims that have been or future claims that may be brought against us the fact that a significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements   12        the sensitivity of our business to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results the potential that failure to maintain the integrity of internal customer information could result in damage of reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or other restrictions on our use or transfer of data increases in gaming taxes and fees in the jurisdictions in which we operate the potential for conflicts of interest to arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of mgm china which is now a publicly traded company listed on the hong kong stock exchange and the risks associated

of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business financial positions results of operations or cash flows in evaluating us you should consider carefully among other things the risks described below   risks related to our substantial indebtedness    our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 136 billion principal amount of indebtedness outstanding including 28 billion of borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility we had approximately 12 billion of available borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility as of december 31 2012 any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs in addition as of december 31 2012 mgm grand paradise sa mgm grand paradise the company that owns and operates mgm macau had approximately 554 million of debt outstanding under its amended and restated credit facility we do not guarantee mgm chinas obligations under its credit agreement and to the extent mgm china were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service its indebtedness our ability to make additional investments into that entity is limited by the negative covenants in our existing debt instruments in addition our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences including     increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in our business and industry limiting our ability to borrow additional funds making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness or  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to lessleveraged competitors      moreover our businesses are capital intensive for our owned and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties wellmaintained modernized and refurbished such investment requires an ongoing supply of cash and to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained similarly future development projects and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments the incurrence of additional debt guarantees of thirdparty debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations    current and future economic and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service or refinance our indebtedness and to make planned expenditures our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures and investments in joint ventures depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future our ability to receive distributions from joint ventures and our ability to borrow under our senior credit facility to the extent of available borrowings if adverse regional and national economic conditions persist worsen or fail to improve significantly we could experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in consumer spending levels and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations continue to receive distributions from joint ventures or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs   16            we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2015 and thereafter our ability to timely refinance and replace such indebtedness will depend upon the foregoing as well as on continued and sustained improvements in financial markets if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments there is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us if at all on satisfactory terms on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements    the agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business as well as significantly affect our liquidity and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations covenants governing our senior credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict among other things our ability to     pay dividends or distributions repurchase or issue equity prepay debt or make certain investments incur additional debt or issue certain disqualified stock and preferred stock incur liens on assets pledge or sell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all assets enter into transactions with affiliates allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets and enter into sale and leaseback transactions      our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness any default under our senior credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth our financial condition our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and could force us to seek protection under the bankruptcy laws  in addition mgm grand paradise and mgm china are coborrowers under an amended and restated credit facility which contains covenants that restrict their ability to engage in certain transactions in particular the mgm china amended and restated credit facility requires mgm china to satisfy various financial covenants including a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio and imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on mgm grand paradise and its subsidiaries including among other things limitations on its ability to pay dividends or distributions to us incur additional debt make investments or engage in other businesses merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer or sell assets     risks related to our business    we face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow the hotel resort and casino industries are highly competitive we do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area and hotel resort and gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our customers to the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations competition will increase major competitors including new entrants have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity or are currently expanding their capacity or constructing new resorts in las vegas and macau also the growth of gaming in areas outside las vegas including california has increased the competition faced by our operations in las vegas and elsewhere in particular as large scale gaming operations on native american tribal lands has increased particularly in california competition has increased   17            in addition competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the us and elsewhere result in the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos such as has happened in california in the united states outside the united states while our macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near asia including singapore australia and new zealand certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming including malaysia vietnam and cambodia and others such as japan taiwan and thailand may legalize casino gaming in the future furthermore currently mgm grand paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaries open additional facilities for example the facilities currently being developed in cotai macau we would face increased competition furthermore most jurisdictions in which casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical andor geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities which may include acquisitions of existing properties that do arise  in addition to competition with other hotels resorts and casinos we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow    our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries states and provinces in which we operate these laws regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but generally concern the responsibility financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations as such our gaming regulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or alternatively cease operations in that jurisdiction in addition unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions the regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we are subject to various gaming taxes which are subject to possible increase at any time by various state and federal legislatures and officials increases in gaming taxation could also adversely affect our results for a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect our business see regulation and licensing     further our directors officers key employees and joint venture partners must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities if state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or joint venture partner unsuitable we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the joint venture partner may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in the joint venture state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or joint venture partners to ensure compliance with applicable standards for example as a result of the new jersey division of gaming enforcement the dge investigation of our relationship with our joint venture partner in macau we entered into a settlement agreement with the dge under which we were required to sell our 50 ownership interest in borgata and related leased land in atlantic city on august 8 2011 the new jersey casino control commission approved an amendment to the settlement agreement which extends the time within which the sale of the trust property must occur by 18 months so that until march 24 2013 we have the right to direct the trustee to sell the trust    18        property the divestiture period but if the sale is not concluded by that date the trustee will sell such interests within the following 12 months the terminal sale period on february 13 2013 the settlement agreement was further amended to allow us to reapply to the ccc for licensure in new jersey and to defer expiration of these periods pending the outcome of the licensure process if the ccc denies our licensure request then the divestiture period will immediately end and the terminal sale period will immediately begin which will result in our borgata interest being disposed of by the trustee pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities  in macau current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are for the most part fairly recent and there is little precedent on the interpretation of these laws and regulations these laws and regulations are complex and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations or issue new or modified regulations that differ from mgm chinas interpretation which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations in addition mgm chinas activities in macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies we cannot assure you that mgm china will be able to obtain all necessary approvals and any such failure to do so may materially affect its longterm business strategy and operations macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions however to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues  in addition to gaming regulations we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters smoking employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising for example illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places including bars restaurants work places schools and casinos and in january 2013 casinos in macau including mgm china implemented a smoking ban in which a portion of casino floors are to be designated nonsmoking the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance  we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and antimoney laundering regulations any violations of antimoney laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted    our business is affected by economic and market conditions in the markets in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending on conventions and business development economic contraction economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for hotels casino resorts trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury amenities we offer in addition changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel an unstable job or housing market perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth or fears of war and future acts of terrorism aria bellagio mgm grand las vegas and the mirage in particular may be affected by economic conditions in the far east and all of our nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the united states and california in particular a recession economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts which would adversely affect our operating results for example the recent economic uncertainty has impacted consumer and corporate spending which has had a negative impact on our results of   19        operations in addition the weak housing and real estate marketboth generally and in nevada particularlyhas negatively impacted citycenters ability to sell residential units  in addition since we expect a significant number of customers to come to mgm macau from mainland china general economic and market conditions in china could impact our financial prospects any slowdown in economic growth or changes to chinas current restrictions on travel and currency movements could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china to mgm macau as well as the amounts they are willing to spend in the casino for example in may and july 2008 china readjusted its visa policy toward macau and limited the number of visits that some mainland chinese citizens may make to macau in a given time period in september 2008 it was publicly announced that mainland chinese citizens with a hong kong visa but not a macau visa could no longer enter macau from hong kong in addition in may 2009 china also began to restrict the operation of belowcost tour groups involving low upfront payments and compulsory shopping which were popular among visitors to macau from mainland china it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect or become more restrictive in the future these developments have had and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have the effect of reducing the number of visitors to macau from mainland china which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in macau    we have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china in connection with the initial public offering of mgm china the holding company that indirectly owns and operates mgm macau we entered into a deed of noncompete undertakings with mgm china and ms pansy ho pursuant to which we are restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the peoples republic of china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china while gaming is currently prohibited in china hong kong and taiwan if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete with our competitors in these locations could be limited until the earliest of i march 31 2020 ii the date mgm chinas ordinary shares cease to be listed on the stock exchange of hong kong limited or iii the date when our ownership of mgm china shares is less than 20 of the then issued share capital of mgm china   the macau government can terminate mgm grand paradises subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating mgm grand paradise the macau government can exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession in 2017 or the macau government can refuse to grant mgm grand paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2020 any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the subconcession in the event of fundamental noncompliance by mgm grand paradise with applicable macau laws or mgm grand paradises basic obligations under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such noncompliance with its fundamental obligations under the subconcession contract within a period to be stipulated by the macau government upon such termination all of mgm grand paradises casino area premises and gamingrelated equipment would be transferred automatically to the macau government without compensation to mgm grand paradise and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will perform all of its obligations under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the macau government     furthermore under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the macau government might promulgate in the future we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macau businesses if any disagreement arises between mgm grand paradise and the macau government regarding the interpretation of or mgm grand paradises compliance with a provision of the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation    20        process with the macau government during any consultation or negotiation mgm grand paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the macau government currently there is no precedent concerning how the macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above the loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in macau which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  in addition the subconcession contract expires on march 31 2020 unless the subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended all of mgm grand paradises casino premises and gamingrelated equipment will automatically be transferred to the macau government on that date without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations beginning on april 20 2017 the macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one years prior notice in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right mgm grand paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and nongaming revenue generated by mgm grand paradise excluding the convention and exhibition facilities during the taxable year prior to the redemption before deducting interest depreciation and amortization multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to renew or extend the subconcession contract on terms favorable to mgm grand paradise or at all we also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed the compensation paid to mgm grand paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues    we are required to build and open our development in cotai macau by january 2018 if we are unable to meet this deadline and the deadline for the development is not extended we may lose the land concession which would prohibit us from operating any facilities developed under such land concession the land concession for the approximately 178 acre site on cotai macau was officially gazetted on january 9 2013 if we are unable to build and open our proposed resort and casino by january 2018 and the deadline is not extended the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the land concession contract a loss of the land concession could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   mgm grand paradise is dependent upon gaming junket operators for a significant portion of gaming revenues in macau junket operators who promote gaming and draw highend customers to casinos are responsible for a significant portion of mgm grand paradises gaming revenues in macau with the rise in gaming in macau the competition for relationships with junket operators has increased while mgm grand paradise is undertaking initiatives to strengthen relationships with junket operators there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain or grow relationships with junket operators if mgm grand paradise is unable to maintain or grow relationships with junket operators or if junket operators are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our highend customers mgm grand paradises ability to grow gaming revenues will be hampered     in addition the quality of junket operators is important to mgm grand paradises and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with gaming licenses while mgm grand paradise strives for excellence in associations with junket operators we cannot assure you that the junket operators with whom mgm grand paradise is or becomes associated with will meet the high standards insisted upon if a junket operator falls below mgm grand paradises standards mgm grand paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gaming regulators with authority over our operations    extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business which could harm our business and results of operations certain of our casino properties are located in   21        areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions including but not limited to hurricanes in the united states and severe typhoons in macau such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas although we maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme weather conditions such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect if at all on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions furthermore such extreme weather conditions may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows    because our major domestic gaming resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified as such our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the las vegas tourism industry for example the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from las vegas can adversely affect our business we cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from las vegas but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand can impact the number of visitors to our resorts additionally there is one principal interstate highway between las vegas and southern california where a large number of our customers reside capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities   we extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables we conduct a portion of our gaming activities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments table games players typically are issued more markers than slot players and highend players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts highend gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming and variances in winloss results attributable to highend gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter we issue markers to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant in the opinion of management an extension of credit in addition mgm grand paradise extends credit to certain gaming promoters and those promoters can extend credit to their customers uncollectible receivables from highend customers and gaming promoters could have a significant impact on our results of operations   while gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the us of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from us courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations and even where gaming debts are enforceable they may not be collectible our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results  furthermore we expect that mgm macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions including macau to the extent mgm macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions mgm macau may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because among other reasons courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm macau may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts moreover under applicable law mgm macau remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers    22        we may incur impairments to goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or long lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits we review our goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative guidance significant negative trends reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in writedowns and impairment charges in the past and if one or more of such events occurs in the future additional impairment charges may be required in future periods if we are required to record additional impairment charges this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations   leisure and business travel especially travel by air are particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events such as terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility we are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air since most of our customers travel by air to our las vegas and macau properties any terrorist act outbreak of hostilities escalation of war or any actual or perceived threat to the security of travel by air could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows furthermore although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts insurance coverage against loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable   investing through partnerships or joint ventures including citycenter decreases our ability to manage risk in addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly we have from time to time invested and expect to continue to invest as a coventurer joint venturers often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets therefore the operation of a joint venture is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters in addition joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that the coventurer might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives consequently actions by a coventurer might subject hotels and resorts owned by the joint venture to additional risk further we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners alternatively our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent additionally should a joint venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for our partners or coventurers share of joint venture liabilities     for instance citycenter which is 50 owned and managed by us has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations if citycenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our partners are unable to support future funding requirements as necessary such event could have adverse financial consequences to us in addition the agreements governing citycenters indebtedness subject citycenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness place liens upon assets make distributions to us make certain investments consummate certain asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates including us and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets the citycenter second amended and restated credit facility also includes certain financial covenants that require citycenter to maintain a minimum trailing annual ebitda as defined in citycenters second amended and restated credit facility for each quarter commencing on march 31 2013 we cannot be sure that citycenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test  in addition in accordance with our joint venture agreement and the citycenter second amended and restated credit facility we provided a completion guarantee which is secured by our interests in the assets of circus circus las vegas and certain adjacent undeveloped land    23        any of our future construction or development projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks which could have a material adverse impact on related project timetables costs and our ability to complete the projects     any of our future construction or development projects will be subject to a number of risks including   lack of sufficient or delays in availability of financing changes to plans and specifications engineering problems including defective plans and specifications shortages of and price increases in energy materials and skilled and unskilled labor and inflation in key supply markets delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations applicable to gaming leisure residential real estate development or construction projects labor disputes or work stoppages disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors personal injuries to workers and other persons environmental health and safety issues including site accidents and the spread of viruses weather interferences or delays fires typhoons and other natural disasters geological construction excavation regulatory and equipment problems and other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases    the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs delay or prevent the construction development or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future construction projects which we might undertake we cannot guarantee that our construction costs or total project costs for future projects will not increase beyond amounts initially budgeted    our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer in addition our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future although we have all risk property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss such as fire natural disasters acts of war or terrorism each policy has certain exclusions in addition our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty in addition certain casualty events such as labor strikes nuclear events acts of war loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism deterioration or corrosion insect or animal damage and pollution may not be covered at all under our policies therefore certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses   in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event    24                       we renew our insurance policies other than our builders risk insurance on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits further increase our deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage    citycenter has decided to abate the potential for structural collapse of the harmon in the event of a codelevel earthquake by demolishing the building and we are exposed to risks prior to or in connection with the demolition process after partial construction of the harmon citycenter discovered that in certain elements of the building known as link beams the reinforcing steel had been installed incorrectly by citycenters general contractor perini building company perini and its subcontractors after additional structural defects in other areas of the harmon were discovered further construction at the harmon was indefinitely stopped during the third quarter of 2010 citycenter determined that the harmon was unlikely to be completed using the existing partially completed structure as it now stands a consulting engineer engaged by citycenter in 2011 to conduct a review requested by the clark county building division the building division opined among other things that in a codelevel earthquake using either the permitted or current code specified loads it is likely that critical structural members in the tower will fail and become incapable of supporting gravity loads leading to a partial or complete collapse of the tower there is missing or misplaced reinforcing steel in columns beams shear walls and transfer walls throughout the structure of the tower below the twentyfirst floor in response to this opinion the building division required citycenter to provide a plan of action to abate the potential for structural collapse of the harmon after expert consultation citycenter informed the building division that it has decided to abate the potential for structural collapse of the harmon by demolishing the building subject to the receipt of court approval a partial or complete collapse of the harmon prior to demolition or the demolition process itself could result in property damage or injury which could have a material adverse effect on citycenters and our business andor cause reputational harm to citycenter and us citycenters second amended and restated credit facility provides that certain demolition expenses may be funded only by equity contributions from its members or certain specified extraordinary receipts which include any proceeds from the perini litigation   any failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business the development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success while our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one trademark or combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual property we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations through the use of trademarks we file applications for and obtain trademarks in the united states and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights parties may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource we cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the united states and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others the unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance competitive advantages or goodwill which could adversely affect our business   tracinda owns a significant amount of our common stock and may have interests that differ from the interests of other holders of our stock as of december 31 2012 tracinda corporation beneficially owned approximately 19 of our outstanding common stock as a result tracinda may be able to exercise significant influence over us as a result of its significant ownership of our outstanding   25        common stock for example actions requiring stockholder approval that may be supported by other stockholders might be effectively blocked by tracinda corporation    we are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under nonunited states laws regulations and customs in particular the risks associated with the operation of mgm macau or any future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories include     changes in laws and policies that govern operations of companies in macau or other foreign jurisdictions changes in nonunited states government programs possible failure to comply with antibribery laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions general economic conditions and policies in china including restrictions on travel and currency movements difficulty in establishing staffing and managing nonunited states operations different labor regulations changes in environmental health and safety laws potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws  political instability and actual or anticipated military and political conflicts economic instability and inflation recession or interest rate fluctuations and uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures      these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  we are also exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates if the united states dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries our united states dollar reported income from sources where revenue is dominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease    any violation of the foreign corrupt practices act or any other similar anticorruption laws could have a negative impact on us a significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the united states which exposes us to complex foreign and us regulations inherent in doing crossborder business and in each of the countries in which we transact business we are subject to compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other similar anticorruption laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the sec and us department of justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the fcpa the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations   we face risks related to pending claims that have been or future claims that may be brought against us claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries in various legal proceedings and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time we may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business financial condition and results of operations please see the further discussion legal proceedings   26        a significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect our business and results of operations approximately 30000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements the collective bargaining agreements covering most of our las vegas union employees expire in 2013 a prolonged dispute with the covered employees could have an adverse impact on our operations in addition wage and or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations and to the extent that our nonunion employees join unions we would have greater exposure to risks associated with labor problems   our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results we are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and therefore higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations accordingly increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results additionally higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues   failure to maintain the integrity of internal customer information could result in damage of reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data we collect information relating to our guests for various business purposes including marketing and promotional purposes the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs andor adversely impact our ability to market our products properties and services to our guests in addition noncompliance with applicable privacy regulations by us or in some circumstances noncompliance by third parties engaged by us or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage of reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data   we may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets any of which may be unsuccessful we intend to consider strategic and complementary investments in other businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with third parties investments in businesses properties or assets as well as these alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to     spending cash and incurring debt assuming contingent liabilities contributing properties or related assets to hospitality ventures that could result in recognition of losses or creating additional expenses      we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from such investments or alliances    if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees our results could be adversely affected state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities from time to time legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws affecting the gaming industry periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase gaming taxes or fees depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected   27        conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of mgm china the holding

artificially inflated the market price of the companys securities by knowingly making materially false and misleading public statements and omissions concerning the companys financial condition its liquidity its access to credit and the costs and progress of construction of the citycenter development the consolidated amended complaint asserts violations of sections 10b and 20a of the exchange act and rule 10b5 thereunder   on march 15 2011 all defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on the grounds that it fails to allege facts upon which relief could be granted under the federal securities laws and on the further ground that the complaint fails to satisfy the heightened pleading standards mandated by the private securities litigation reform act pslra the motions to dismiss emphasized three primary arguments 1 the complaint fails to allege that the defendants made false or misleading statements of fact as opposed to statements concerning plans and expectations that did not anticipate the severity of the financial crisis of 20082009 and the challenges presented by constructing citycenter 2 the complaint fails to allege facts supporting a strong inference of wrongful intent as the pslra requires and 3 the complaint fails to plead adequately that the alleged wrongdoing was the cause of the decline in the price of the companys publicly traded securities the parties completed the briefing in support of and in opposition to the motions to dismiss and requested oral argument on the motions   on march 27 2012 the court issued an order which granted the defendants motion to dismiss plaintiffs consolidated complaint without prejudice and allowed plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint on april 17 2012 plaintiffs filed an amended

shareholder derivative action case no a09599937c discussed above   in december 2010 and january 2011 the company and its directors filed motions with the court to dismiss the derivative complaints in the israni and kim cases the defendant company officers also filed a separate motion to dismiss on the grounds that plaintiffs failed to allege either that a presuit demand had been made on the companys board of directors and had been wrongfully rejected or that making such a demand would have been futile because the case falls within the extremely rare circumstance where the board would have been legally incapable of exercising its business judgment on the litigation decision in march 2011 after the filing of these dismissal motions and pursuant to the parties stipulation the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint that asserted claims similar to those in their earlier complaints in april 2011 the defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on the same grounds as their original motions to dismiss after hearing on the motions to dismiss in june 2010 the court in july 2010 granted the motions on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to allege facts excusing them from making a presuit demand on the companys board of directors the court directed that the defendants submit a proposed order setting forth the factual and legal bases the defendants submitted a proposed order and the plaintiffs submitted an objection to the proposed order   on may 15 2012 the court in the israni and kim cases entered an order that granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend and an order that dismissed plaintiffs consolidated amended complaint with prejudice on june 14 2012 the plaintiffs filed a notice of

shareholder derivative actions involve the same former and current director and officer defendants as those in the consolidated state court derivative actions and also name the company as a nominal defendant they make factual allegations similar to those alleged in the state court actions asserting claims of among other things breach of fiduciary duty by defendants asserted improper financial reporting insider selling and misappropriation of information waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment in june 2010 the plaintiffs in these two actions made a joint motion for consolidation and

december 2012 refinancing transactions  36           item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    executive overview   our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we believe that we own and invest in several of the premier casino resorts in the world and have continually reinvested in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financings fund capital expenditures and provide excess cash flow for future development we have historically made significant investments in our resorts through the addition of new restaurants entertainment nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities in addition we have made regular capital investments to maintain the quality of our hotel rooms and public spaces   cash flows generated by our whollyowned domestic resorts in 2012 improved compared to 2011 and 2010 and we expect that trend to continue in 2013 despite continued economic uncertainty visitation to las vegas was up 2 in 2012 and room inventory has peaked with limited new rooms supply planned in the near term   in macau cash flows from operations improved significantly in 2012 led by strong gaming volumes despite continued concerns about economic instability in china and the implementation of new smoking restrictions in macau we expect the macau market to continue to grow in 2012 the pace of growth slowed down but casino revenues for the macau market still grew 14 over 2011 with a significant increase in main floor volumes   our results of operations are also affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital during 2012 we executed a number of transactions which have greatly improved our cost of capital extended our debt maturities and provided capital for future growth projects see principal debt arrangements for further discussion of our debt agreements and related covenants and contractual obligations for debt maturities and interest obligations as of december 31 2012 in 2012 we completed the following transactions   in january we issued 850 million of 8625 senior notes due 2019 for net proceeds of approximately 836 million in february we amended and restated our senior credit facility which reduced libor spread and libor floor for extending loans as well as extended maturities to 2015 in march mgm china limited mgm china paid an approximately 400 million dividend of which we received approximately 204 million and approximately 196 million was distributed to noncontrolling interests also in march we issued 10 billion of 775 senior notes due 2022 for net proceeds of approximately 986 million in september we issued 10 billion of 675 senior notes due 2020 for net proceeds of approximately 986 million in october mgm china and mgm grand paradise sa mgm grand paradise as coborrowers amended and extended their credit facility and increased the facilitys capacity to 20 billion which will be used for the development of the proposed cotai resort and for general corporate purposes and in december we completed a transaction which included the amendment and restatement of our senior credit facility which increased its capacity to 40 billion and extended its maturity and the issuance of 125 billion of 6625 senior notes due 2021 for net proceeds of approximately 123 billion we used the proceeds from these transactions together with cash on hand to complete the tender offers and redemption and satisfaction and discharge of all of our outstanding   37        13 senior secured notes due 2013 10375 senior secured notes due 2014 11125 senior secured notes due 2017 and 9 senior secured notes due 2020     in addition in february 2013 mgm chinas board of directors declared a special dividend of approximately 500 million which will be paid to shareholders of record as of march 11 2013 and distributed on or about march 18 2013 we will receive approximately 255 million representing 51 of such dividend   while we are focused on continuing to improve our financial position and lower our interest costs we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities in macau we plan to spend approximately 26 billion excluding land and capitalized interest to develop a resort and casino featuring approximately 1600 hotel rooms 500 gaming tables and 2500 slots built on an approximately 178 acre site in cotai macau in addition we have been actively pursuing development opportunities in markets such as maryland massachusetts and toronto    reportable segments    we have two reportable segments that are based on the regions in which we operate wholly owned domestic resorts and mgm china we currently operate 15 wholly owned resorts in the united states mgm chinas operations consist of the mgm macau resort and casino mgm macau and the potential development of a gaming resort in cotai we have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates our mgm hospitality operations and certain other corporate and management operations citycenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate which we also manage for a fee our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as corporate and other operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results   wholly owned domestic resorts at december 31 2012 our wholly owned domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts                las vegas nevada   bellagio mgm grand las vegas including the signature mandalay bay the mirage luxor new yorknew york excalibur monte carlo and circus circus las vegas      other   mgm grand detroit in detroit michigan beau rivage in biloxi mississippi gold strike tunica in tunica mississippi circus circus reno in reno nevada gold strike in jean nevada and railroad pass in henderson nevada      over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities we market to different customer groups to manage our hotel occupancy such as targeting large conventions to increase midweek occupancy as a result of our leveraged business model our operating results are significantly affected by our ability to generate operating revenues also we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts in las vegas nevada which exposes us to certain risks such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts and from the expansion of gaming in the united states generally  38       key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts are   gaming revenue indicators table games drop and slots handle volume indicators win or hold percentage which is not fully controllable by us our normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 19 to 22 of table games drop and our normal slots hold percentage is in the range of 75 to 85 of slots handle and hotel revenue indicators  hotel occupancy a volume indicator average daily rate adr a price indicator and revenue per available room revpar a summary measure of hotel results combining adr and occupancy rate our calculation of adr which is the average price of occupied rooms per day includes the impact of complimentary rooms complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or cash rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis particularly to casino customers includes a disproportionate suite component the composite adr including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the adr for cash rooms reflecting the higher retail value of suites    mgm china on june 3 2011 we and ms ho pansy catilina chiu king ms pansy ho completed a reorganization of the capital structure and the initial public offering of 760 million shares of mgm china on the stock exchange of hong kong limited the ipo representing 20 of the post issuance base capital stock of mgm china at an offer price of hkd 1534 per share pursuant to this reorganization we acquired through a wholly owned subsidiary an additional 1 of the overall capital stock of mgm china for hkd 1534 per share or approximately 75 million and thereby became the owner of 51 of mgm china following the ipo the underwriters exercised their overallotment rights with respect to 59 million shares mgm china owns mgm grand paradise the macau company that owns the mgm macau and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions and is in the process of developing a gaming resort in cotai see below for additional information about the cotai development project   through the acquisition of the additional 1 interest of mgm china we obtained a controlling interest and were required to consolidate mgm china as of june 3 2011 prior to the ipo we held a 50 interest in mgm grand paradise which was accounted for under the equity method the acquisition of the controlling financial interest was accounted for as a business combination and we recognized 100 of the assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests of mgm china at fair value at the date of acquisition the fair value of the equity of mgm china was determined by the ipo transaction price and equaled approximately 75 billion the carrying value of our equity method investment was significantly less than our share of the fair value of mgm china resulting in a 35 billion gain on the acquisition   we believe our investment in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability asia is the fastestgrowing gaming market in the world and macau is the worlds largest gaming destination in terms of revenue and has continued to grow over the past few years despite the global economic downturn   on october 18 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government for its planned development on cotai the land concession contract became effective on january 9 2013 when the macau government published it in the official gazette of macau and has an initial term of 25 years the land premium payable to the macau government for the land concession contract is approximately 161 million and is composed of a down payment and eight additional semiannual payments in october 2012 mgm china paid approximately 56 million as the initial down payment of the contract premium including interest on the eight semiannual payments mgm china has approximately 118 million remaining payable for the land concession contract in addition mgm grand paradise is required to pay the macau government approximately 269000 per year  39      in rent during the course of development of the land and approximately 681000 per year in rent once the development is completed the annual rent is subject to review by the macau government every five years mgm china has made significant progress in getting its construction team in place as well as finalizing its designs under the terms of the land concession contract mgm grand paradise is required to complete the development of the land within 60 months from the date of publication   our current mgm china operations consist of mgm macau and the development of the new gaming resort in cotai revenues at mgm macau are generated primarily from gaming operations made up of two distinct market segments main floor and highend vip mgm macau main floor operations consist of both table games and slot machines offered to the public which usually consists of walkin and day trip visitors vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by inhouse vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through the use of gaming promoters also known as junket operators these operators introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau assist these customers with travel arrangements and extend gaming credit to these players   vip gaming at mgm macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips called rolling chips gaming promoters purchase these rolling chips from mgm macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players the rolling chips allow mgm macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters clients in order to determine vip gaming play in exchange for the gaming promoters services mgm macau pays them either through rolling chip turnoverbased commissions or through revenuesharing arrangements the estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to vip customers is recorded net against casino revenue and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded to casino expense   in addition to the key performance indicators used by our wholly owned domestic resorts mgm macau utilizes turnover which is the sum of rolling chip wagers won by mgm macau rolling chips purchased plus rolling chips exchanged less rolling chips returned turnover provides a basis for measuring vip casino win percentage normal win for vip gaming operations at mgm macau is in the range of 27 to 30 of turnover mgm macaus main floor normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 20 to 30 of table games drop normal slots hold percentage at mgm macau is in

the three years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010   in 2010 we recorded an impairment charge of approximately 128 million which decreased the carrying value of our investment in borgata to approximately 250 million as of september 30 2010 the impairment charge was based on an offer received from a potential buyer at that time and authorized by our board of directors we ultimately did not reach final agreement with such buyer  45       in 2011 we determined that it was necessary to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge for our investment in borgata of 62 million as of december 31 2011 using an estimated fair value for our investment of 185 million based on a discounted cash flow analysis key assumptions included in such analysis include managements estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capital expenditures an appropriate discount rate and longterm growth rate at the time there was significant uncertainty surrounding borgatas future operating results primarily due to the planned opening of a major new resort in the atlantic city market during 2012 and other additional competition expected in surrounding markets as a result for purposes of this analysis management reflected a decrease in forecasted cash flows in 2012 and 2013 also management used a longterm growth rate of 3 and a discount rate of 105 which it believed appropriately reflects risk associated with the estimated cash flows   in 2012 we determined that it was necessary to record an additional otherthantemporary impairment charge for our investment in borgata of 65 million as of december 31 2012 using an estimated fair value for our investment of 120 million based on a discounted cash flow analysis borgatas 2012 operating results did not meet previous forecasts while 2012 results for borgata were significantly impacted by hurricane sandy management believes the challenging environment in atlantic city will continue and has lowered 2013 estimates below what was previously forecasted also we used a longterm growth rate of 25 and a discount rate of 105 which we believe appropriately reflects risk associated with the estimated cash flows this analysis is sensitive to management assumptions and increases or decreases in these assumptions would have a material impact on the analysis   las vegas strip land we own 335 acres on the north end of the las vegas strip which we have been holding for future development we have focused our development efforts on other jurisdictions which led to us reviewing our significant development land holdings for impairment indicators due to our focus on future development outside of the las vegas area we do not believe it is likely we will recover the carrying value of our 335 acres of land on the north end of the las vegas strip on an undiscounted basis therefore we recorded an impairment charge of 366 million as of december 31 2012 based on an estimated fair value of 214 million for the land we determined fair value of the land using a market approach based on assessment of comparable land sales in las vegas adjusted for size and location factors based on comparisons to our land   atlantic city land we own two sites for a total of approximately 86 acres in atlantic city which we have been holding for future development due to our focus on future development outside atlantic city the continued deterioration of the atlantic city market and the initial underperformance of a new resort that opened in 2012 we do not believe it is likely we will recover the carrying value of this land on an undiscounted basis therefore we recorded an impairment charge of 167 million as of december 31 2012 based on an estimated fair value of 125 million for the land we determined fair value of the land using a market approach based on assessment of comparable land sales in atlantic city adjusted for size and location factors based on comparisons to our land   investment in grand victoria at june 30 2012 we reviewed the carrying value of our grand victoria investment for impairment due to a decrease in operating results at the property and the loss of market share as a result of the opening of a new riverboat casino in the illinois market as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flows for 2013 through 2015 we used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value key assumptions included in the analysis were estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capital expenditures a longterm growth rate of 2 and a discount rate of 105 as a result of the discounted cash flow analysis we determined that it was necessary to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 85 million based on an estimated fair value of 205 million for our 50 interest we intend to and believe we will be able to retain our investment in grand victoria however due to the extent of the shortfall and our assessment of the uncertainty of fully recovering our investment we determined that the impairment was otherthantemporary  46       investment in silver legacy silver legacy had approximately 143 million of outstanding senior secured notes that were due in march 2012 silver legacy did not repay its notes at maturity and filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in may 2012 these notes were nonrecourse to us we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge at december 31 2011 which decreased the carrying value of our investment in silver legacy to zero and ceased applying the equity method for our investment in silver legacy in november 2012 silver legacy completed a consensual plan of reorganization pursuant to which the holders of the senior secured notes received a combination of cash and new second lien notes concurrently silver legacy entered into an agreement for a new 70 million senior secured credit facility which provided for a portion of the exit financing associated with the plan of reorganization as part of the reorganization the partners invested 75 million each in the form of subordinated sponsor notes we resumed the equity method of accounting for our investment in silver legacy subsequent to completion of the reorganization   investment in citycenter at june 30 2010 we reviewed our citycenter investment for impairment using revised operating forecasts developed by citycenter management based on the then current and forecasted market conditions and because citycenters results of operations through june 30 2010 were below previous forecasts and the revised operating forecasts were lower than previous forecasts we concluded that we should review the carrying value of our investment we determined that the carrying value of our investment exceeded our fair value determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and therefore an impairment was indicated we intend to and believe we will be able to retain our investment in citycenter however due to the extent of the shortfall and our assessment of the uncertainty of fully recovering our investment we determined that the impairments were otherthantemporary and recorded impairment charges of 112 billion in the second quarter of 2010   at september 30 2010 we recognized an increase of 232 million in our total net obligation under our citycenter completion guarantee and a corresponding increase in our investment in citycenter the increase primarily reflected a revision to prior estimates based on our assessment of the most current information derived from our closeout and litigation processes we completed an impairment review as of september 30 2010 and as a result recorded an additional impairment of 191 million in the third quarter of 2010   the discounted cash flow analyses for our investment in citycenter included estimated future cash inflows from operations including residential sales and estimated future cash outflows for capital expenditures the june 2010 and september 2010 analyses used an 11 discount rate and a long term growth rate of 4 related to forecasted cash flows for citycenters operating assets   circus circus reno at september 30 2011 we reviewed the carrying value of our circus circus reno longlived assets for impairment using revised operating forecasts developed by management for that resort in the third quarter of 2011 due to the then current and forecasted market conditions and results of operations through september 30 2011 being lower than previous forecasts we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 80 million in the third quarter of 2011 primarily related to a writedown of circus circus renos longlived assets our discounted cash flow analysis for circus circus reno included estimated future cash inflows from operations and estimated future cash outflows for capital expenditures utilizing an estimated pretax discount rate of 165 and a longterm growth rate of 2   other other property transactions net in 2012 include writedowns related to the remodeling of the theatre at mandalay bay the renovation of the imax theatre at luxor and various other miscellaneous asset disposals and disposal costs other property transactions in 2011 include the writeoff of

in march 2010   we hold south jersey transportation authority special revenue bonds the original proceeds from which were used to provide funding for the atlantic citybrigantine connector project the repayment of the remaining principal and interest for the bonds is supported by eligible investment alternative tax obligation payments made to the casino reinvestment development authority from future casino licensees on the renaissance pointe land owned by us however we believe the probability for casino development on renaissance pointe in the foreseeable future is remote due to the continued deterioration of the atlantic city market and initial underperformance of a recent resort that opened in the market as such we have assumed no future cash flows will be received to support the carrying value of the bonds and recorded an otherthantemporary impairment of 47 million as of december 31 2012   income taxes the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes                         year ended december 31          2012    2011    2010          in thousands      income loss before income taxes    1734213   2831631    2216025     benefit for income taxes

benefit on pretax loss in 2012 was substantially below the 35 statutory rate primarily due to the fact that we began recording a valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets during the year we recorded an income tax benefit in 2011 even though we had pretax income for the year because we did not provide us deferred taxes on the 35 billion gain recorded on the acquisition of the controlling financial interest in mgm china the gain increased the excess amount for financial reporting over the us tax basis of our investment in mgm china no us deferred taxes were provided for this excess amount because we expect it to resolve through repatriations of future mgm china earnings for which there will be sufficient foreign tax credits to offset all us income tax that would result from such repatriations excluding the mgm china gain we would have provided income tax benefit at an effective tax rate of 607 for 2011 higher than the federal statutory rate due primarily to an income tax benefit resulting from a decrease to the macau net deferred tax liability recorded to reflect an assumed 5year extension of the exemption from complementary tax on gaming profits and a lower effective tax rate on mgm china earnings the income tax benefit on pretax loss in 2010 was provided essentially at the federal statutory rate of 35   cash taxes paid in 2012 consisted primarily of foreign and state taxes the net refunds of cash taxes in 2011 and 2010 were due primarily to the carryback to prior years of us federal income tax net operating losses incurred in 2010 and 2009 respectively all us net operating loss carryback refund potential was realized as a result of these carrybacks and tax net operating losses may now only be carried forward    nongaap measures    adjusted ebitda is earnings before interest and other nonoperating income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses property transactions net and the gain on the mgm china transaction adjusted property ebitda is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the mgm resorts stock option plan which is not allocated to each property mgm china recognizes stock compensation expense related to its stock  49      compensation plan which is included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for mgm china adjusted ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes these measures are 1 widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industry and 2 a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies   we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects property transactions net includes normal recurring disposals gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period in addition capital allocation tax planning financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level therefore we use adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of wholly owned domestic resorts operating performance   adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments taxes and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitda information may calculate adjusted ebitda in a different manner   the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss                         year ended december 31

provided by operating activities related to mgm china which included an increase in cash related to outstanding gaming liabilities prior year operating cash flows include 354 million related to mgm china for the period from june 3 2011 through december 31 2011 in addition increased cash flows at our resorts were offset by lower tax refunds received in the current year period compared to the

shareholders of record as of march 11 2013 and distributed on or about march 18 2013 we expect to receive approximately 255 million representing 51 of such dividend   citycenter completion guarantee in january 2011 we entered into an amended completion and cost overrun guarantee which is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of circus circus las vegas as well as certain undeveloped land adjacent to that property the terms of the amended completion guarantee provide citycenter the ability to utilize up to 124 million of subsequent net residential proceeds to fund construction costs or to reimburse us for construction costs previously expended as of december 31 2012 citycenter had received net residential proceeds in excess of the 124 million and is holding 112 million in a separate bank account representing the remaining condo proceeds available to fund completion guarantee obligations or be reimbursed to us in accordance with citycenters credit agreement and bond indentures such amounts can only be used to fund construction lien obligations or reimbursed to us once the perini litigation is settled   as of december 31 2012 we have funded 692 million under the completion guarantee and have accrued a liability of 28 million which includes estimated litigation costs related to the resolution of disputes with contractors concerning the final construction costs and estimated amounts to be paid to contractors through the legal process related to the perini litigation our estimated obligation has been offset by the portion of the condo proceeds received by citycenter estimated to be used to settle construction lien claims upon the resolution of the perini litigation but has not been offset by the remaining amount that we currently estimate we will be reimbursed from condo proceeds that have been received by citycenter also our accrual reflects certain estimated offsets to the amounts claimed by the contractors citycenter has reached settlement agreements with all but seven of perinis firsttier subcontractors however significant disputes remain with the general contractor and the remaining subcontractors amounts claimed by such parties exceed amounts included in our completion guarantee accrual by approximately 154 million as such amounts exceed our best estimate of our liability moreover we have not accrued for any contingent payments to citycenter related to the harmon hotel amp spa component which will not be completed using the building as it now stands   harmon demolition in response to a request by the clark county building division the building division citycenter engaged an engineer to conduct an analysis based on all available information as to the structural stability of the harmon under buildingcodespecified load combinations on july 11 2011 that engineer submitted the results of his analysis of the harmon tower and podium in its current asbuilt condition the engineer opined among other things that in a codelevel earthquake using either the permitted or current code specified loads it is likely that critical structural members in the tower will fail and become incapable of supporting gravity loads leading to a partial or complete collapse of the tower there is missing or misplaced reinforcing steel in columns beams shear walls and transfer walls throughout the structure of the tower below the twentyfirst floor based on this engineering opinion the building division requested a plan of action from citycenter citycenter informed the building division it decided to abate the potential for structural collapse of the harmon in the event of a codelevel earthquake by demolishing the building and enclosed a plan of action for demolition by implosion prepared by lvi environmental services of nevada inc lvi citycenter also advised that prior to undertaking the demolition plan of action it would seek relief from a standing order of the district court judge presiding over the perini litigation that prohibits alteration or destruction of the building without  57      court approval in addition citycenter supplied the foundational data for the engineering conclusions stated in the july 11 2011 letter declaring the harmons structural instability in the event of a codelevel earthquake on november 22 2011 the building division required that citycenter submit a plan to abate the code deficiencies discovered in the harmon tower   in december 2011 citycenter resubmitted to the building division the plan of abatement action prepared by lvi which was first submitted on august 15 2011 and met with the building division about the requirements necessary to obtain demolition permits and approvals as discussed above the timing of the demolition of the harmon is subject to rulings in the perini litigation   we do not believe we would be responsible for funding under the completion guarantee any additional remediation efforts that might be required with respect to the harmon however our view is based on a number of developing factors including with respect to ongoing litigation with citycenters contractors actions by local officials and other developments related to the citycenter venture all of which are subject to change citycenters revolving credit facility provides that certain demolition or repair expenses may be funded only from i member contributions designated for demolition of the harmon ii the proceeds of certain specified extraordinary receipts which include any proceeds from the perini litigation or iii cash or cash equivalents in an amount not to exceed 30 million in the aggregate based on current estimates which are subject to change we believe the demolition of the harmon would cost approximately 32 million

arrangements    our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates which consist primarily of our investments in citycenter grand victoria and silver legacy we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a fullscale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment we have not historically guaranteed financing obtained by our investees and there are no other provisions of the venture agreements which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort  59       commitments and contractual obligations   the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations as of december 31 2012                                  2013    2014    2015    2016    2017    thereafter

            1estimated interest payments are based on principal amounts and expected maturities of debt outstanding at december 31 2012 and managements forecasted libor rates for our senior credit facility and hibor rates for the mgm grand paradise credit facility 2approximately 119 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and other tax liabilities are excluded from the table as we cannot reasonably estimate when examination and other activity related to these amounts will conclude 3under our completion guarantee for citycenter we are committed to fund amounts in excess of currently funded project costs based on current forecasted expenditures we estimate that we will be required to fund approximately 28 million for such guarantee excluding amounts expected to be received from residential proceeds received by citycenter of 73 million 4the amount for 2013 includes approximately 193 million of construction commitments 100 million of employment agreements 94 million of entertainment agreements and 59 million of open purchase orders other commitments include various contracted amounts including information technology advertising maintenance and other service agreements our largest entertainment commitments consist of minimum contractual payments to cirque du soleil which performs shows at several of our resorts our contractual commitments for these shows generally do not exceed 12 months and are based on our ability to exercise certain termination rights however we expect these shows to continue for longer periods excluded from the above table is approximately 118 million of the remaining premium and interest payable to the macau government for the cotai land concession as the agreement was not effective until it was published in the official gazette of macau in january 2013    as discussed in executive overview and in liquidity and capital resources we have made significant progress toward improving our financial position our december 2012 financing transactions provided for a significant reduction in interest expense projected for 2013 and enabled us to extend our maturities in addition our access to lower cost financing and ability to finance development opportunities has also improved significantly as a result of these transactions while we have significant indebtedness we believe we have the ability to meet known obligations including principal and interest obligations as well as planned capital expenditures over the next few years with cash flows from operations and availability under our senior credit facility   we expect to spend approximately 350 million in capital expenditures at our wholly owned domestic resorts during 2013 we do not expect to spend significant amounts of capital on new developments but future capital expenditures could vary from our current expectations depending on the progress of our development efforts and the structure of our ownership interests in future developments in macau we expect to spend approximately 250 million on capital improvements at mgm macau and our cotai project excluding land and capitalized interest during 2013   critical accounting policies and estimates   managements discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make  60      estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates however by their nature judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates    business combinations    we accounted for our acquisition of mgm china in june 2011 as a business combination and have historically had significant acquisitions accounted for as business combinations in a business combination we determine the fair value of acquired assets including identifiable intangible assets assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests the fair value of the acquired business is allocated to the acquired assets assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests based on their fair value with any remaining fair value allocated to goodwill this allocation process requires use of estimates and assumptions including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets identifiable finitelife intangible assets such as certain license rights and customer lists are amortized over the intangible assets estimated useful life the method of amortization reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed if determinable normally estimated based on estimated future cash flows of the intangible asset goodwill as well as other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment as discussed further below    allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable    marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at aria bellagio mgm grand las vegas and the mirage in addition mgm china extends credit to certain in house gaming customers and gaming promoters our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau at december 31 2012 and 2011 approximately 27 and 28 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states at december 31 2012 and 2011 approximately 63 and 61 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability among other factors when we issue credit to customers who are not residents of the united states   we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customers financial condition collection history and any other known information we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate   in addition to enforceability issues the collectibility of unpaid markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the  61      allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a regions economy occur   the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables                         at december 31          2012    2011    2010          in thousands      casino receivables    294312    347679    229318      allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable     90452     94800

million of casino receivables and 14 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31 2012 the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has increased in the current year primarily due to an increase in the aging of accounts at december 31 2012 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change pretax net income by 3 million    fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies    property and equipment are stated at cost for the majority of our property and equipment cost has been determined based on estimated fair values in connection with the june 2011 mgm china acquisition the april 2005 mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period   we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment in addition our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively    impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets    we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as a held for sale or b to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist  62      we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset for operating assets fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses   there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates   on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results negative industry or economic factors significant changes to our operating environment or changes in intended use of the asset group we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group including potential sale historically undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin   we review indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach and trademarks which are tested for impairment using the relieffromroyalty method goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates as of the date we completed our 2012 goodwill impairment analysis the estimated fair values of our reporting units with associated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying values for all our reporting units with goodwill except for mgm china as of the date of our goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter we determined that the fair value of our mgm china reporting unit is slightly in excess of its carrying value therefore no impairment was indicated as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if future operating results for mgm china do not meet our current expectations we may be required to record an impairment charge related to the mgm china goodwill   there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the determination of capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions   see operating resultsdetails of charges for further discussion of write downs and impairments of longlived assets  63                   impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates    we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in value if such conditions exist we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is otherthantemporary based on our assessment of relevant factors including consideration of our intent and ability to retain our investment we estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates see results of operations for discussion of impairment charges    income taxes    we recognize deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied given the negative impact of the us economy on the results of operations in the past several years we no longer rely on future domestic operating income in assessing the realizability of our domestic deferred tax assets and now rely only on the future reversal of existing domestic taxable temporary differences as of december 31 2012 the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal deductible temporary differences exceeds the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal taxable temporary differences consequently during 2012 we began recording a valuation allowance for us federal deferred tax assets in order to account for this excess at december 31 2012 such valuation allowance was 10 billion in addition there is a 13 million valuation allowance after federal effect provided on certain state deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of 61 million on certain macau deferred tax assets because we believe these assets do not meet the more likely than not criteria for recognition   our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities   we assess our tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a more likely than not threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current other accrued liabilities or longterm other longterm liabilities based on the time until expected payment additionally we recognize accrued interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense   we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material   as of december 31 2012 we are no longer subject to examination of our us consolidated federal income tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2005 the irs completed its examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2003 and 2004 tax years during 2010 and we paid 12 million in tax and 4 million in associated interest with respect to adjustments to which we agreed in addition we submitted a protest to irs appeals of certain adjustments to which we did not agree we expect the issues subject to appeal will be settled within the next 12 months during the fourth quarter of 2010 the irs opened an examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2005 through 2009 tax years we expect that the irs will complete this examination within the next 12 months and we may agree to certain adjustments and protest others   during the first quarter of 2011 the irs opened audits of the 2007 through 2008 tax years of citycenter holdings llc an unconsolidated affiliate treated as a partnership for income tax purposes  64      and the 2008 through 2009 tax years of mgm grand detroit llc a subsidiary treated as a partnership for income tax purposes the irs has completed field work with respect to these examinations and the issuance of final audit reports is pending we may agree to certain adjustments and protest others   during 2010 we reached settlement with irs appeals with respect to the audit of the 2004 through 2006 tax years of mgm grand detroit llc at issue was the tax treatment of payments made under an agreement to develop own and operate a hotel casino in the city of detroit we agreed to pay 1 million in tax for such years as a result of this settlement   during the fourth quarter of 2010 we and our joint venture partner reached tentative settlement with irs appeals with respect to the audit of the 2003 and 2004 tax years of a cost method investee of ours that is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes the adjustments to which we agreed in such tentative settlement will be included in any settlement that we may reach with respect to the 2003 and 2004 examination of our consolidated federal income tax return the irs is currently auditing the 2005 through 2009 tax years of this investee we expect that the irs will complete this examination within the next 12 months and we may agree to certain adjustments and protest others   during 2010 the irs closed its examination of the federal income tax return of mandalay resort group for the preacquisition year ended april 25 2005 and issued a nochange letter the statutes of limitations for assessing tax for all mandalay resort group preacquisition years are now closed   as of december 31 2012 other than adjustments resulting from the federal income tax audits discussed above and the exceptions noted below we were no longer subject to examination of our various state and local tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2008 during 2010 the state of illinois initiated an audit of our illinois combined returns for the 2006 and 2007 tax years such audit closed in 2012 resulting in an immaterial refund of taxes from such years during 2010 the state of new jersey began audit procedures of a cost method investee of ours for the 2003 through 2006 tax years no other state or local income tax returns are currently under exam    stockbased compensation    we account for stock options and stock appreciation rights sars measuring fair value using the blackscholes model for restricted share units rsus compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant we account for performance stock units psus measuring fair value using the monte carlo valuation model there are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the blackscholes model and monte carlo valuation model our volatility and expected term assumptions used in the blackscholes model can significantly affect the fair value of stock options and sars the monte carlo valuation model also utilizes multiple assumptions including volatility to determine the fair value of the award changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of sharebased compensation and consequently the related amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements the extent of the impact will depend in part on the extent of awards in any given year for 2012 a 10 change in the assumptions used in the blackscholes and monte carlo valuation models would not have resulted in a material impact on the fair value of the awards granted   2005 omnibus incentive plan in 2012 we granted 26 million sars and 07 million psus with a total fair value of 22 million in 2011 we granted 35 million sars with a total fair value of 19 million in 2010 we granted 38 million sars with a total fair value of 27 million

after december 15 2011 such amendments included a consistent definition of fair value enhanced disclosure requirements for level 3 fair value adjustments and other changes to required disclosures our adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on our financial statements   in june 2011 asc 220 comprehensive income was amended and became effective for us for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 we elected to present a separate statement of comprehensive income which provides each component of net income along with total net income each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income our adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on our financial statements   in september 2011 asc 350 intangiblesgoodwill and others was amended to simplify the assessment of goodwill impairment and became effective for us for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 the amended guidance allows us to do an initial qualitative assessment of relative events and circumstances to determine if fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying value prior to performing the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test our adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on our financial statements   in july 2012 asc 350 intangiblesgoodwill and others was amended to simplify the assessment of testing the impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill and will become effective for us for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 the amended guidance allows us to do an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts prior to performing the quantitative indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test we do not believe the adoption of this amendment will have a material effect on our financial statements   market risk   in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations we are also exposed to additional market risks market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions   as of december 31 2012 longterm variable rate borrowings represented approximately 25 of our total borrowings assuming a 100 basispoint increase in libor in the case of term b loans over the 1 floor specified in our senior credit facility our annual interest cost would change by approximately 28 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31 2012 assuming a 100 basispoint increase in hibor for the mgm grand paradise credit facility our annual interest cost would change by  66      approximately 6 million based on amounts outstanding at december 31 2012 the following table provides additional

of estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   fair value measurements fair value measurements affect the companys accounting and impairment assessments of its longlived assets investments in unconsolidated affiliates cost method investments assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition goodwill and other intangible assets fair value measurements also affect the companys accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy that includes level 1 inputs such as quoted prices in an active market level 2 inputs which are observable inputs for similar assets or level 3 inputs which are unobservable inputs    the fair value of the companys treasury securities

significant events in these countries could affect the collectibility of such receivables   accounts receivable are typically noninterest bearing and are initially recorded at cost accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the companys receivables to their net carrying amount which approximates fair value the allowance is estimated based on specific review of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions management believes that as of december 31 2012 no significant concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been recorded   inventories inventories consist primarily of food and beverage retail merchandise and operating supplies and are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is determined primarily using the

met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets held for sale the company recognizes the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs to sell as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used the company reviews for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist the company then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset typically measured using a discounted cash flow model if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses see note 16

otherthantemporary decline in value if such conditions exist the company compares the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine if an impairment is indicated and determines whether the impairment is otherthantemporary based on its assessment of all relevant factors including consideration of the companys intent and ability to retain its investment the company estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates see note 6 for results of the

alternative tax obligation payments made to the casino reinvestment development authority from future casino licensees on the renaissance pointe land owned by the company however management believes

reporting units discounted using market discount rates and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities and the amount remaining if any is the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value then it must be written down to its implied fair value license rights are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach and trademarks are tested for impairment using the relieffromroyalty method if the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount an

2294458   2411036                     the company recorded a net deferred tax liability of 381 million at june 3 2011 for the acquisition of the controlling financial interest in mgm china and a corresponding increase to goodwill the net deferred tax liability represented the excess on the acquisition date of the financial reporting amounts of the net assets of mgm china over their respective bases under macau tax law measured at the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods such differences are expected to be realized net of a valuation allowance  114       income generated from gaming operations of mgm grand paradise which is wholly owned by mgm china is exempted from macaus 12 complementary tax for the fiveyear period ending december 31 2016 pursuant to approval from the macau government granted on september 22 2011 absent this exemption net income attributable to mgm resorts international would have been reduced by 34 million and 18 million for 2012 and 2011 respectively and net income per share diluted would have been reduced by 007 and 003 for 2012 and 2011 respectively the approval granted in 2011 represented the second fiveyear exemption period granted to mgm grand paradise the company measures the net deferred tax liability of mgm grand paradise under the assumption that it will receive an additional fiveyear exemption beyond 2016 such assumption is based upon the granting of a third fiveyear exemption to a competitor of mgm grand paradise the company believes mgm grand paradise should also be entitled to a third fiveyear exemption in order to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment among gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires a requirement under macanese law   nongaming operations remain subject to the macau complementary tax mgm grand paradise had at december 31 2012 a complementary tax net operating loss carryforward of 417 million resulting from nongaming operations that will expire if not utilized against nongaming income in years 2013 through 2015 the macanese net operating loss carryforwards are fully offset by a valuation allowance   mgm grand paradises exemption from the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits does not apply to dividend distributions of such profits to mgm china however in june 2012 mgm grand paradise reached an agreement with the macau government to settle the 12 complementary tax that would otherwise be due by its shareholders including mgm china on distributions of its gaming profits by paying a flat annual payment annual fee arrangement regardless of the amount of distributable dividends such annual fee arrangement covers the years 2007 through 2011 including a distribution that was made during the first quarter of 2012 the covered period cumulative annual payments of 4 million for the covered period were paid and a corresponding reduction to benefit for income taxes was recorded in 2012 shareholders of mgm grand paradise are not subject to the complementary tax on distributions they received during the covered period as a result of the annual fee arrangement consequently the company reversed complementary taxes previously accrued on such distributions resulting in a 19 million increase to benefit for income taxes in 2012 mgm grand paradise submitted a request for a fiveyear extension of the annual fee arrangement covering all years through 2016 extended annual fee arrangement which was approved by the macau government in december 2012 annual payments of 2 million are required under the extended annual fee arrangement the 2 million annual payment for 2012 was accrued and a corresponding reduction to benefit for income taxes was recorded in 2012   as of december 31 2012 the company had an excess amount for financial reporting over the us tax basis of its investment in mgm china of 36 billion that management does not consider to be essentially permanent in duration the company expects substantially all of this basis difference to resolve through repatriations of future mgm china earnings the company has not provided us deferred taxes for the excess financial reporting basis expected to resolve through repatriations of future mgm china earnings because it believes there would be sufficient foreign tax credits to offset all us income tax that would result from the future repatriation of such earnings deferred taxes of 5 million are provided for the basis difference not expected to resolve through repatriations of future mgm china earnings   during 2012 the company repatriated 263 million of foreign earnings creditable foreign taxes associated with such earnings increased the companys foreign tax credit carryover from 2 million to 786 million such foreign taxes consist of the macau special gaming tax which the company believes qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against us income taxes the preexisting foreign tax credit carryover expires in 2015 and the carryover created by the 2012 repatriation expires in 2022 the foreign tax credit carryovers are subject to valuation allowance as described further below  115       the company has a us federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of 17 billion that will begin to expire in 2030 an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of 12 million that will not expire a general business tax credit carryforward of 23 million that will begin to expire in 2029 and a charitable contribution carryforward of 11 million that will begin to expire in 2014   at december 31 2011 the company was close to the ownership change threshold set forth in internal revenue code irc section 382 as a result of transactions in its stock over the past several years however as of december 31 2012 the stock issuance in may 2009 is no longer part of the threeyear testing period and the company is no longer close to the ownership change threshold should an ownership change occur in a future period the companys us federal income tax net operating losses and tax credits incurred prior to the ownership change would generally be subject to a postchange annual usage limitation equal to the value of the company at the time of the ownership change multiplied by the longterm tax exempt rate at such time as established by the internal revenue service irs the company does not anticipate that this limitation would prevent the utilization of the companys net operating losses and tax credits prior to their expiration or materially impact the cash taxes payable in future years   for state income tax purposes the company has illinois and new jersey net operating loss carryforwards of 77 million and 238 million respectively which equates to deferred tax assets after federal tax effect and before valuation allowance of 4 million and 14 million respectively the illinois net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire if not utilized by 2021 the new jersey net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by various dates from 2013 through 2032   during 2011 the state of michigan enacted changes in its corporate tax law that became effective on january 1 2012 the state replaced the michigan business tax mbt regime with a new corporate income tax cit regime that taxes unitary combined income apportioned to the state at a 6 rate net operating loss carryforwards generated under the mbt of which the company had 198 million at december 31 2011 may not be carried over and utilized under the cit losses generated under the cit will have a 10 year carryforward period furthermore the booktax difference deduction which would have been available under the mbt in 2015 through 2029 is not available under the cit during 2011 the company recorded an increase to the net michigan deferred tax liability in the amount of 8 million after federal effect to reflect the impact of this tax law change with a corresponding reduction to income tax benefit   given the negative impact of the us economy on the results of operations in the past several years the company no longer relies on future domestic operating income in assessing the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets and now relies only on the future reversal of existing domestic taxable temporary differences as of december 31 2012 the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal deductible temporary differences exceeds the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal taxable temporary differences consequently during 2012 the company began recording a valuation allowance for us federal deferred tax assets in order to account for this excess at december 31 2012 such valuation allowance was 10 billion in addition there is a 13 million valuation allowance after federal effect provided on certain state deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of 61 million on certain macau deferred tax assets because the company believes these assets do not meet the more likely than not criteria for recognition   the company assesses its tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a more likely than not threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities recorded as a result of this analysis must generally be recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and at december 31 2012 the company has classified 19 million as current in other accrued liabilities and 123 million as longterm in other longterm obligations based on the time until expected payment  116       a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is

completion guarantee in january 2011 the company entered into an amended completion and cost overrun guarantee which is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of circus circus las  119      vegas as well as certain undeveloped land adjacent to that property the terms of the amended completion guarantee provide citycenter the ability to utilize up to 124 million of subsequent net residential proceeds to fund construction costs or to reimburse the company for construction costs previously expended as of december 31 2012 citycenter had received net residential proceeds in excess of the 124 million and is holding 112 million in a separate bank account representing the remaining condo proceeds available to fund completion guarantee obligations or be reimbursed to the company in accordance with citycenters credit agreement and bond indentures such amounts can only be used to fund construction lien obligations or reimbursed to the company once the perini litigation is settled   as of december 31 2012 the company has funded 692 million under the completion guarantee and has accrued a liability of 28 million which includes estimated litigation costs related to the resolution of disputes with contractors concerning the final construction costs and estimated amounts to be paid to contractors through the legal process related to the perini litigation the companys estimated obligation has been offset by the portion of the condo proceeds received by citycenter estimated to be used to settle construction lien claims upon the resolution of the perini litigation but has not been offset by the remaining amount that it currently estimates it will be reimbursed from condo proceeds that have been received by citycenter also the companys accrual reflects certain estimated offsets to the amounts claimed by the contractors citycenter has reached settlement agreements with all but seven of perinis firsttier subcontractors however significant disputes remain with the general contractor and the remaining subcontractors amounts claimed by such parties exceed amounts included in the companys completion guarantee accrual by approximately 154 million as such amounts exceed the companys best estimate of its liability moreover the company has not accrued for any contingent payments to citycenter related to the harmon hotel amp spa component which will not be completed using the building as it now stands   harmon demolition in response to a request by the clark county building division the building division citycenter engaged an engineer to conduct an analysis based on all available information as to the structural stability of the harmon under buildingcodespecified load combinations on july 11 2011 that engineer submitted the results of his analysis of the harmon tower and podium in its current asbuilt condition the engineer opined among other things that in a codelevel earthquake using either the permitted or current code specified loads it is likely that critical structural members in the tower will fail and become incapable of supporting gravity loads leading to a partial or complete collapse of the tower there is missing or misplaced reinforcing steel in columns beams shear walls and transfer walls throughout the structure of the tower below the twentyfirst floor based on this engineering opinion the building division requested a plan of action from citycenter citycenter informed the building division it decided to abate the potential for structural collapse of the harmon in the event of a codelevel earthquake by demolishing the building and enclosed a plan of action for demolition by implosion prepared by lvi environmental services of nevada inc lvi citycenter also advised that prior to undertaking the demolition plan of action it would seek relief from a standing order of the district court judge presiding over the perini litigation that prohibits alteration or destruction of the building without court approval in addition citycenter supplied the foundational data for the engineering conclusions stated in the july 11 2011 letter declaring the harmons structural instability in the event of a codelevel earthquake on november 22 2011 the building division required that citycenter submit a plan to abate the code deficiencies discovered in the harmon tower   in december 2011 citycenter resubmitted to the building division the plan of abatement action prepared by lvi which was first submitted on august 15 2011 and met with the building division about the requirements necessary to obtain demolition permits and approvals the timing of the demolition of the harmon is subject to rulings in the perini litigation as discussed above   the company does not believe it would be responsible for funding under the completion guarantee any additional remediation efforts that might be required with respect to the harmon however the companys view is based on a number of developing factors including with respect to ongoing litigation  120      with citycenters contractors actions by local officials and other developments related to the citycenter venture all of which are subject to change citycenters revolving credit facility provides that certain demolition or repair expenses may be funded only from i member contributions designated for demolition of the harmon ii the proceeds of certain specified extraordinary receipts which include any proceeds from the perini litigation or iii cash or cash equivalents in an amount not to exceed 30 million in the aggregate based on current estimates which are subject to change the company believes the demolition of the harmon would cost approximately 32 million   sales and use tax on complimentary meals in march 2008 the nevada supreme court ruled in a case involving another gaming company that food and nonalcoholic beverages purchased for use in providing complimentary meals to customers and to employees were exempt from use tax the company had previously paid use tax on these items and has generally filed for refunds for the periods from january 2001 to february 2008 related to this matter the company is claiming the exemption on sales and use tax returns for periods after february 2008 in light of this nevada supreme court decision and has not accrued or paid any sales or use tax for those periods in february 2012 the nevada department of taxation asserted that customer complimentary meals and employee meals are subject to sales tax on a prospective basis commencing february 15 2012 in july 2012 the nevada department of taxation announced that sales taxes applicable to such meals are due and payable without penalty or interest at the earlier of certain regulatory judicial or legislative events or june 30 2013 the nevada department of taxations position stems from a nevada tax commission decision concerning another gaming company which states that complimentary meals provided to customers are subject to sales tax at the retail value of the meal and employee meals are subject to sales tax at the cost of the meal the other gaming company filed in clark county district court a petition for judicial review of the nevada tax commission decision and the court recently issued a ruling in such case holding that complementary meals provided to customers were subject to sales tax while meals provided to employees were not subject to sales tax this decision has been appealed to the nevada supreme court the company continues to disagree with the nevada department of taxation assertions based on an analysis of the facts and circumstances as of the date of these financial statements the company does not believe it is probable it will incur a liability with respect to such assertions any reasonably possible range of loss would not be material to the companys financial statements as of december 31 2012   cotai land concession contract on october 18 2012 mgm grand
