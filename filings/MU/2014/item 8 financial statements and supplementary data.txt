manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china japan malaysia puerto rico singapore and taiwan our inotera joint venture has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment dram nand flash and nor flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines in 2014 we transitioned one of our singapore wafer fabrication facilities from production of dram to nand flashour process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment we continuously enhance our production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in 2014 the majority of our dram production was manufactured on our 30nm linewidth process technology we expect that in 2015 that the majority of our dram production will be manufactured on our 25nm and 20nm linewidth process technologies in 2014 a majority of our nand flash memory production was manufactured on 20nm linewidth process technology we expect that in 2015 a majority of our nand flash production will be manufactured on our 16nm linewidth process technology we expect to begin sampling 3d nand flash products in the fourth quarter of calendar 2014 and to begin volume production in the second half of calendar 2015wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionalitywe test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process perform high temperature burnin on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and costwe sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie bare die forms our packaged products include memory modules ssds mcps managed nand memory cards and usb devices we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment we contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing companies to manufacture nand flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices 5in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product linesavailability of raw materialsour operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we andor our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedmarketing and customersour products are sold into compute and graphics mobile ssd and other storage automotive industrial medical and other embedded and server markets market concentrations from 2014 net sales were approximately as follows 30 for compute and graphics including desktop pcs notebooks and workstations 20 for mobile 20 for ssd and other storage 10 for automotive industrial medical and other embedded and 10 for server sales to kingston primarily dram were 10 of

dram were 9 of our net sales in 2014 10 of our net sales in 2013 and 8 of our net sales in 2012our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron lexar crucial spectek and elpida brand names and private labels we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world we sell lexarbranded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several monthsbacklogbecause of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 6product warrantybecause the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery under our general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditionscompetitionwe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation sk hynix inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices many of our highvolume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors for these highvolume memory products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factors for our other memory products the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence to pricingresearch and developmentour process technology rampd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies as well as new fundamentally different memory structures materials and packages which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rampd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram and lpdram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including 3d nand and mlc and tlc technologies nor flash memory specialty memory ssds hmcs and other memory technologies and systemsour rampd expenses were 137 billion 931 million and 918 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we share certain rampd process technology and design costs for nand flash and emerging technologies with intel we shared rampd process and design costs for dram with nanya through december 2012 when our costsharing agreement was terminated as a result of reimbursements under our intel and nanya costsharing arrangements our overall rampd expenses were reduced by 137 million 146 million and 225 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectivelyto compete in the semiconductor memory industry we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions our process design and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world with our largest rampd centers located in boise idaho hiroshima japan hashimoto japan and milpitas california we have several additional product design centers in other strategic locations around the world in addition we develop photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boiserampd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rampd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product

shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory productsthe semiconductor memory industry is highly competitivewe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation sk hynix inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments such as china may be considering providing or have provided significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs transitions to smaller linewidth process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 11our inotera supply agreement involves numerous riskswe have a supply agreement with inotera the inotera supply agreement under which we are obligated to purchase substantially all of inoteras dram output over an initial threeyear term at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components currently through december 2016 the inotera supply agreement contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive oneyear extensions and if the parties do not agree to an extension the agreement will terminate following the end of the thenexisting term plus a subsequent threeyear winddown period in the event of a winddown our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period we are currently in negotiations regarding the extension of the inotera supply agreement there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement our inotera supply agreement involves numerous additional risks including the followinghigher costs for supply obtained under the inotera supply agreement as compared to our whollyowned facilitiesdifficulties and delays in ramping production at inoteradifficulties in transferring technology to inotera anddifficulties in coming to an agreement with nanya regarding major corporate decisions such as capital expenditures or capital structurefor 2014 we purchased 268 billion of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 38 of our aggregate dram gigabit production if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affecteddebt obligations could adversely affect our financial conditionwe are engaged in a capital intensive business subject to significant changes in supply and demand and product pricing and recent periods of consolidation any of which could result in our incurrence or assumption of indebtedness in recent periods our debt levels have increased as of august 28 2014 we had debt with a carrying value of 659 billion in addition the conversion value in excess of principal amount for our convertible notes outstanding as of august 28 2014 was 299 billion in 2014 we paid 230 billion to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of 109 billion in the first quarter of 2015 we paid 389 million to settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of 114 million as of august 28 2014 as of august 28 2014 we had two credit facilities available that provide for up to 408 million of additional financing subject to outstanding balances of trade receivables and other conditions events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy the applicable drawdown conditions and utilize either of these facilities we have in the past and expect in the future to continue to incur additional debt to finance our capital investments including debt incurred in connection with assetbacked financingour debt obligations could adversely impact us for example these obligations couldrequire us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions research and development expenditures and other business activitiescontinue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notesrequire us to continue to pay cash amounts substantially in excess of the principal amounts upon settlement of our convertible notes to minimize dilution of our earnings per share limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures strategic acquisitions or business opportunities research and development and other general corporate requirementscontribute to a future downgrade of our credit rating which could increase future borrowing costs andincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditionsour ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future this to some extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 12we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investmentsour cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rampd and product and process technology we estimate that capital spending for 2015 will be approximately 36 billion to 40 billion in addition as a result of the mmj acquisition we believe that our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels as we integrate our manufacturing operations and support the increase of capacity resulting from the transaction as of august 28 2014 we had cash and equivalents of 415 billion shortterm investments of 384 million and longterm marketable investments of 819 million cash and investments included 160 billion held by mmj and its consolidated subsidiaries and 84 million held by imft none of which is generally available to finance our other operationsas a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings with the japan court under the corporate reorganization act of japan the japan proceedings for so long as such proceedings are continuing the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies installment payments these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the mmj companies as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court as a result the assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries while available to satisfy the mmj companies installment payments and the other obligations capital expenditures and other operating needs of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are not available for use by us in our other operations furthermore certain uses of the assets of the mmj companies including investments in certain capital expenditures in mmt may require consent of mmjs trustees andor the japan courtin the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our current debt levels expected debt amortization and general economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt amortization payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operationsthe acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimondaon january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimonda insolvency proceedings filed suit against mti and micron semiconductor bv our netherlands subsidiary micron bv in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron bv and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron bv purchased substantially all of qimondas shares of inotera memories inc the inotera shares representing approximately 55 of our total shares in inotera and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks among other things to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent crosslicense between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement 13following a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate on march 13 2014 the court issued judgments 1 ordering micron bv to pay approximately 1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase 2 ordering micron bv to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties 3 ordering micron bv to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares including in particular any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits 4 denying qimondas claims against micron technology for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera and 5 determining that qimondas obligations under the patent crosslicense agreement are cancelled in addition the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering among other things 1 that micron bv transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by it and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties and 2 that micron bv pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares the interlocutory judgments have no immediate enforceable effect on us and accordingly we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case we have filed a notice of appeal and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court a hearing on the matter is scheduled for february 2 2015we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or equivalent monetary damages unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron bv from the ownership of the inotera shares andor the termination of the patent crosslicense which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as of august 28 2014 the inotera shares had a carrying value for purposes of our financial reporting of 505 million and a market value of 206 billionour future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologiesour key semiconductor memory technologies of dram nand flash and nor flash face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability to meet these requirements we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance andor cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies  there can be no assurance of the followingthat we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory technologiesthat we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new productsthat we will be able to successfully market these technologies andthat margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development effortsif our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affectednew product development may be unsuccessfulwe are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development including systemlevel memory products over the next several years the process to develop dram nand flash nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 14products that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on usproducts that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways including the followingwe may be required to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product or replace productswe could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages andwe may encounter adverse publicity which could cause a decrease in sales of our productsa determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionas is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see item 1 legal proceedingswe have a number of intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable termsour joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous riskswe have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these relationships include our imft nand flash joint venture with intel our inotera dram joint venture with nanya and our mp mask joint venture with photronics these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the followingour interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities or on the amount timing or nature of further investments in our joint venturewe may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventureswe may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint venturesour control over the operations of our joint ventures is limitedwe may recognize losses from our equity method investments in future periodsdue to financial constraints our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with themdue to differing business models or longterm business goals our partners may decide not to join us in funding capital investment by our joint ventures which may result in higher levels of cash expenditures by uscash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirementswe may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partnersthe terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable andchanges in tax legal or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partnersif our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 15the operations of the mmj companies will be subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedingsbecause the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj the japan proceedings are continuing and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the japan proceedings the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petitionduring the pendency of the japan proceedings the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively integrate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companiesif our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedwe manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the us singapore taiwan japan and china additionally our control over operations at our imft inotera mp mask and tera probe joint ventures is limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment equipment failures earthquakes or other environmental acts if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships any of which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionwe may incur additional restructure or other charges in future periodsin recent periods we have implemented restructure activities and may implement restructure initiatives in future periods as a result we could incur restructure charges including but not limited to severance and other termination benefits losses on disposition or impairment of equipment or other longlived assets and inventory write downs lose production output lose key personnel and experience disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products in connection with these actions we recorded charges of 40 million for 2014 and 126 million for 2013 we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional costs for these prior restructure activities we may incur additional restructure charges or other losses associated with other initiatives in future periods 16changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionacross our multinational operations there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the euro the singapore dollar the new taiwan dollar the yen and the yuan we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 28 million for 2014 and 229 million for 2013 based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities offset by balance sheet hedges we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 7 million as of august 28 2014 in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies exchange rates for some of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the yen have been volatile in recent periods if these currencies strengthen against the us dollar our manufacturing costs could significantly increase in the event that the exchange rates for us dollar adversely change against our foreign currency exposures in the euro singapore dollar new taiwan dollar the yen and the yuan our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affectedwe may make future acquisitions andor alliances which involve numerous risksacquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the followingintegrating the operations technologies and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operationsincreasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilitiesincreased debt levelsthe assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilitiesthe use of cash to finance a transaction which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital capital expenditures research and development expenditures and other business activitiesdiverting managements attention from normal daily operationsmanaging larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas hiring and retaining key employeesrequirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction which may include among other things divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired businessinability to realize synergies or other expected benefitsfailure to maintain customer vendor and other relationshipsinadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired companys internal financial controls disclosure controls and procedures andor environmental health and safety anticorruption human resource or other policies or practices andimpairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions technological advancements or worsethanexpected performance of the acquired businessin recent years supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram nand flash and nor flash products resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants including the liquidation of qimonda and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida now known as mmj these types of proceedings often lead to courtdirected processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 17the limited availability of raw materials supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionour operations require raw materials and in certain cases third party services that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as silicon wafers controllers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we andor our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials or services is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedour operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the suppliers limited capacity our inability to timely obtain this equipment could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp if we are unable to timely obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedwe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposurewe are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions including among others singapore where we currently have arrangements that allow us to compute our tax provision at rates below the local statutory rates our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the distribution of our earnings among these different jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including challenges by tax authorities to our tax structure income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations we and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with the us federal government various us states and various foreign jurisdictions throughout the world our us federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2010 through 2014 in addition tax returns open to examination in multiple foreign taxing jurisdictions range from the years 2005 to 2014 the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilitywe may not utilize all of our net deferred tax assetswe have substantial deferred tax assets which include among others net operating loss and credit carryforwards as of august 28 2014 our us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards including uncertain tax benefits were 389 billion and 171 billion respectively which if not utilized will expire at various dates from 2015 through 2033 as of august 28 2014 our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were 537 billion including 395 billion pertaining to japan which if not utilized substantially all will expire at various dates from 2018 through 2023 as of august 28 2014 we had valuation allowances of 129 billion and 979 million against our net deferred tax assets in the us and japan respectivelya downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our businessdownturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers mobile devices solidstate drives and servers reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 18our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster fire explosion or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionwe face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionsales to customers outside the united states approximated 84 of our consolidated net sales for 2014 in addition a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states in particular a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are

gain unauthorized access to our network system and steal proprietary information compromise confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customerswe are subject to counterparty default risks we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash deposits investments cappedcall contracts on our stock and derivative instruments as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding in the event of such default we could incur significant losses which could adversely impact our business results of operations or financial condition 19compliance with new regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our productsincreased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act and its implementing sec regulations the doddfrank act imposes new supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo the drc and finance or benefit local armed groups these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing some of our customers may elect to disqualify us

2013 the us court issued a recognition order which recognized the order of the japan court approving mmjs plan of reorganization on november 19 2013 the us court closed the us chapter 15 proceedingthe plans of reorganization provide for payments by the mmj companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items the plans of reorganization also provided for the investment by us pursuant to the sponsor agreement of 60 billion yen 615 million paid at closing in cash into mmj in exchange for 100 ownership of mmjs equity and the use of such investment to fund the initial installment payment by the mmj companies to their creditors of 60 billion yen subject to reduction for certain items specified in the sponsor agreement and plans of reorganizationunder mmjs plan of reorganization secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their fixed claims and unsecured creditors will recover at least 174 of the amount of their fixed claims the actual recovery of unsecured creditors will be higher however based in part on events and circumstances occurring following the plan approval the remaining portion of the unsecured claims will be discharged without payment over the period that payments are made pursuant to the plans of reorganization the secured creditors will be paid in full on or before the sixth installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments mais plan of reorganization provides that secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their claims whereas unsecured creditors will recover 19 of the amount of their claims the secured creditors of mai were paid in full on the first installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments 21because the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of the mmj acquisition the japan proceedings are continuing and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the reorganization proceedings the business trustee will make decisions in relation to the operation of the businesses of the mmj companies other than decisions in relation to acts that need to be carried out in connection with the japan proceedings which will be the responsibility of the legal trustee the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court will continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date the mmj companies may petition the japan court for an early termination of the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made although such early terminations are customarily granted there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition in these particular casesduring the pendency of the japan proceedings the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling material disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively integrate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companiesrambuson may 5 2004

reflecting increases in cnbu ebu and mbu sales primarily due to higher levels of dram and nand flash gigabit sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices the increases in gigabit sales volumes for 2013 were primarily attributable to manufacturing efficiencies driven by improvements in product and process technologies increased dram supply from inotera due to the restructuring of our supply agreement and 355 million of dram sales from the mmj acquisition after its acquisition on july 31 2013gross marginour overall gross margin percentage improved to 33 for 2014 from 20 for 2013 primarily due to improvements in the gross margin percentage for cnbu and mbu as a result of higher margins for dram products the gross margin improvements for cnbu and mbu for 2014 as compared to 2013 resulted primarily from the mmj acquisition manufacturing cost reductions and higher average selling prices for cnbuthrough december 2012 we purchased 50 of inoteras wafer production capacity based on a marginsharing formula among nanya inotera and us since january 2013 we have purchased substantially all of inoteras dram output at a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a new supply agreement the inotera supply agreement our costs for supply from inotera increased in 2014 from 2013 due to increases in average selling prices for our dram products and the changes in the pricing terms the inotera supply agreement has a threeyear term currently through december 2016 that contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive oneyear extensions if the parties do not agree to an extension the agreement will terminate following the end of the thenexisting term plus a subsequent threeyear winddown period in the event of a winddown our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period in 2014 our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities we are currently in negotiations regarding the extension of the inotera supply agreement there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement under the inotera supply agreements we purchased 268 billion 126 billion and 646 million of dram products in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectivelyour gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to reductions in costs and increases in average selling prices cost reductions for 2014 primarily reflected improvements in product and process technologies and the comparatively lower manufacturing costs of the mmj group partially offset by higher costs for product obtained under the inotera supply agreements for 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013 our costs of goods sold for dram products included the sale of the mmj groups inventories recorded at fair value in the mmj acquisition which was higher than the manufacturing cost of such inventories this increased our costs of goods sold by approximately 153 million for 2014 and 41 million for 2013our overall gross margin percentage improved to 20 for 2013 from 12 for 2012 due to improvements in the

billion related to our foreign subsidiaries primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards our valuation allowance decreased 712 million for 2014 primarily due to the utilization of us and foreign net operating losses and due to the 190 million benefit to deferred tax assets of the mmj group the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if significant positive evidence increases management continues to evaluate future financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowances our unrecognized tax benefits increased 150 million in 2014 primarily due to transfer pricing and other matters which was substantially offset by changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowancewe currently operate in several tax jurisdictions where we have arrangements that allow us to compute our tax provision at rates below the local statutory rates that expire in whole or in

any repurchases under the new authorization may be made in open market purchases block trades privately negotiated transactions andor derivative transactions subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination that it is the best use of available cash we expect to use cash on hand to fund any repurchases the repurchase authorization does not obligate us to acquire any common stockwe

prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies installment payments these prohibitions also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain

offset by a 518 million increase in receivables 39investing activitiesnet cash used for investing activities was 245 billion for 2014 which consisted primarily of cash expenditures of 266 billion for property plant and equipment and 506 million for the acquisition of availableforsale securities net of proceeds from sales and maturities of 557 million offset by the use of 534 million of restricted cash in connection with the first mmj creditor installment paymentwe believe that to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and capital equipment and rampd we estimate that capital spending for 2015 will be approximately 36 billion to 40 billion the actual amounts for 2015 will vary depending on market conditions as of august 28 2014 we had commitments of approximately 118 billion for the acquisition of property plant and equipment

sheet including 335 million for the current portion of these longterm liabilities5 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities therefore 255 million in aggregate of longterm income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities has been excluded from the preceding table however other noncurrent liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet included these uncertain tax positions and noncurrent deferred tax liabilitiesthe obligations disclosed above do not include current liabilities except for the current portion of longterm debt the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services market prices changes to agreedupon amounts or timing of certain events for some obligationspurchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria 1 they are noncancellable 2 we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled or 3 we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services takeorpay if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancellable the entire value of the contract was included in the above table if the obligation is cancellable but we would incur a penalty if canceled the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation contracted minimum amounts specified in takeorpay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitmentunder the inotera supply agreement effective on january 1 2013 we are obligated to purchase for a threeyear term currently through december 2016 substantially all of inoteras output at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components the inotera supply agreement contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive oneyear extensions and if the parties do not agree to an extension the agreement will terminate following the end of the thenexisting term plus a subsequent threeyear winddown period in the event of a winddown our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the three year winddown period we purchased 268 billion of dram products from inotera in 2014 under the inotera supply agreement the inotera supply agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity as quantities are based on qualified production output and pricing fluctuates as it is based on market prices therefore we did not include our obligations under the inotera supply agreement in the contractual obligations table above 42offbalance sheet arrangementswe have entered into capped calls which are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution from our convertible notes the capped calls provide for our receipt of cash or shares at our election from our counterparties if the trading price of our stock is above a specified initial strike price at the expiration dates the amounts receivable varies based on the trading price of our stock up to specified cap prices the dollar value of the cash or shares that we would receive from the capped calls on their expiration dates ranges from 0 if the trading price of our stock is below the initial strike price for all of the capped calls to 864 million if the trading price of our stock is at or above the cap price for all of the capped calls to purchase the capped calls we paid 57 million in 2011 103 million in 2012 and 48 million in 2013 respectively the amounts paid were recorded as charges to additional capital for further details of our capped call arrangements see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  equity  micron shareholders equity  capped calls notecritical accounting estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgmentsbusiness acquisitions accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values the items involving the most significant assumptions estimates and judgments included determining the fair value of the followingproperty plant and equipment including determination of values in a continueduse modeldeferred tax assets including projections of future taxable income and tax ratesinventory including estimated future selling prices timing of product sales and completion costs for work in process anddebt including discount rate and timing of paymentsconsolidations we have interests in joint venture entities that are vies determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing 1 whether an entity is a vie and 2 if we are the entitys primary beneficiary to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we evaluate whether we have a the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding and financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies requires significant assumptions and judgmentcontingencies we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date in accounting for the resolution of contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution which are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods 43income taxes we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in recent periods our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and taiwan our income tax provision or benefit is dependent in part on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve numerous judgments including among others projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes manufacturing and overhead costs levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realizedinventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value cost includes labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated market values below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated market value of our memory inventory by approximately 254 million as of august 28 2014 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantlyus gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories inventories are primarily categorized as memory including dram nand flash and nor flash for purposes of determining lower of average cost or market the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and marketsproperty plant and equipment we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performedresearch and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rampd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are valued in inventorystockbased compensation  stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgmentdetermining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock 44recently issued accounting standards see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  recently issued accounting standards noteitem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate riskwe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio substantially all of our indebtedness is at fixed interest rates as a result the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates we estimate that as of august 28 2014 and august 29 2013 a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates of 1 would increase the fair value of our convertible notes and other notes by approximately 250 million and 147 million respectively the increase in interest expense caused by a 1 increase in the interest rates of our variablerate debt would not be significantas of august 28 2014 and august 29 2013 we held debt securities of 1653 million and 787 million respectively that were subject to interest rate risk we estimate that a 05 increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of these instruments by approximately 6 million as of august 28 2014 and 4 million as of august 29 2013foreign currency exchange rate riskthe information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in item 1a risk factors changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial conditionthe functional currency for all of our operations is the us dollar as a result of our foreign operations we incur costs and carry certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies the substantial majority of our revenues are transacted in the us dollar however significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro the shekel the singapore dollar the new taiwan dollar the yen and the yuan we have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates we utilize currency forward and option contracts in these hedging programs our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposesto hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities we utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities offset by balance sheet hedges we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 7 million as of august 28 2014 and 19 million as of august 29 2013 to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures and forecasted operating cash flows we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months and currency options that generally mature within 12 to 18 months as of august 28 2018 under the terms and conditions of the mmj companies plans of reorganization we are obligated to pay 142 billion yen or the equivalent of 137 billion based on exchange rates as of august 28 2014 to the external creditors of the mmj companies the installment payments are due at the end of each calendar year beginning in 2014 through 2019 to mitigate the risk that increases in exchange rates have on the payments due in 2014 and 2015 we entered into forward contracts to purchase 20 billion yen on november 28 2014 and 10 billion yen on november 27 2015 in addition the mmj companies cash and equivalent balances in yen mitigate the foreign currency exchange risk associated with the remaining installment payments due in 2015 and after see item 8

sold is determined using the specific identification methodderivative and hedging instruments  we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities or future cash flows and to reduce the volatility that changes in interest rates on variablerate debt have on our earnings our currency derivatives have consisted of forward and option contracts and interest rate swap contracts we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes derivative instruments are measured at their fair values and recognized as either assets or liabilities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is based on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges for accounting purpose gains or losses from changes in fair values are recognized in other nonoperating income expense for derivative instruments designated as cashflow hedges the effective portion of the gain or loss is included as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective or excluded portion of the gain or loss is included in other nonoperating income expense the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for these cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same line items of the consolidated statements of operation and in the same periods in which the underlying transactions affect earnings effectiveness is measured by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item for the effectiveness assessment of our cashflow hedges changes in the time value are excluded

companies corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan as a result of the japan proceedings for so long as such proceedings are continuing the mmj companies are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies installment payments these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside the ordinary course of business and may require consent of mmjs trustees or in certain cases approval by the japan

since january 2013 we have purchased substantially all of inoteras dram output at a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a new supply agreement the inotera supply agreement our costs for supply from inotera increased in 2014 from 2013 due to changes in average selling prices for our dram products and the changes in the pricing terms the inotera supply agreement has a threeyear term currently through december 2016 that contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive oneyear extensions if the parties do not agree to an extension the agreement will terminate following the end of the thenexisting term plus a subsequent threeyear winddown period in the event of a winddown our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period

tera probe was 39 million based on the closing trading price of 1087 yen per share in an active market and was 9 million below our carrying value we evaluated our investment in tera probe and concluded that the decline in the market value below our carrying value was not an otherthantemporary impairment primarily because of the limited amount of time the fair value was below the carrying value and historical volatility of tera probes stock pricewe incurred manufacturing costs for 2014 and 2013 of 117 million and 13 million respectively for services performed by tera probe

according to the terms of the contracts was generally equal to the fair value of our assets for these contracts as listed in the tables above we seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading risk across multiple financial institutions in addition we monitor the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk on an ongoing basiswe also seek to enter into master netting arrangements with our counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative hedge transactions these master netting

segmentscertain of the raw materials and production equipment we use in manufacturing semiconductor products are available from multiple sources and in sufficient supply however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and production equipment that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplierfinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash money market accounts certificates of deposit fixedrate debt securities trade receivables and derivative contracts we invest through highcreditquality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor a concentration of credit risk may exist with respect to receivables as a substantial portion of our customers are affiliated with the computing industry we perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers worldwide and generally do not require collateral from our customers historically we have not experienced significant losses on receivables a concentration of risk may also exist with respect to derivatives as the number of counterparties to our currency hedges is limited and the notional amounts are relatively large we seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and through entering into master netting arrangements the capped calls expose us to credit risk to the extent the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements we seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across several major financial institutions in addition the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basisgeographic informationgeographic net sales based on customer shipto location were as followsfor the year ended 2014
