transaction acquisition of micron memory japan incon july 31 2013 we completed the mmj acquisition in which we acquired elpida now known as mmj and a controlling interest in rexchip now known as mmt in 2014 we purchased additional interests in mmt increasing our ownership interest to 995 in connection with the mmj acquisition we recorded net assets of 260 billion noncontrolling interests of 168 million and a gain on the transaction of 148 billion in 2013 in the second quarter of 2014 the provisional amounts recorded in connection with the mmj acquisition were adjusted primarily for prepetition liabilities as a result other nonoperating expense for 2014 included these measurement period adjustments of 33 million see item 8 financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements  micron memory japan inc notethe mmj acquisition included a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in hiroshima japan a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility in taichung city taiwan and an assembly and test facility located in akita japan these wafer fabrication facilities together represented approximately 30 of our total wafer capacity for 2014 the mmj groups products include

sales for all segments in 2014 also benefitted as compared to 2013 from increases in dram and nand flash sales volumes driven primarily by higher manufacturing output as a result of improvements in product and process technology and an increased share of output from inoteratotal net sales for 2013 increased 10 as compared to 2012 reflecting increases in cnbu ebu and mbu sales primarily due to higher levels of dram and nand flash gigabit sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices the increases in gigabit sales volumes for 2013 were primarily attributable to manufacturing efficiencies driven by improvements in product and process technologies increased dram supply from inotera due to the restructuring of our supply agreement and 355 million of dram sales from the mmj acquisition after its acquisition on july 31 2013gross marginour overall gross margin percentage improved to 33 for 2014 from 20 for 2013 primarily due to improvements in the gross margin percentage for cnbu and mbu as a result of higher margins for dram products the gross margin improvements for cnbu and mbu for 2014 as compared to 2013 resulted primarily from the mmj acquisition manufacturing cost reductions and higher average selling prices for cnbuthrough december 2012 we purchased 50 of inoteras wafer production capacity based on a marginsharing formula among nanya inotera and us since january 2013 we have purchased substantially all of inoteras dram output at a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a new supply agreement the inotera supply agreement our costs for supply from inotera increased in 2014 from 2013 due to increases in average selling prices for our dram products and the changes in the pricing terms the inotera supply agreement has a threeyear term currently through december 2016 that contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive oneyear extensions if the parties do not agree to an extension the agreement will terminate following the end of the thenexisting term plus a subsequent threeyear winddown period in the event of a winddown our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period in 2014 our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities we are currently in negotiations regarding the extension of the inotera supply agreement there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement under the inotera supply agreements we purchased 268 billion 126 billion and 646 million of dram products in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectivelyour gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to reductions in costs and increases in average selling prices cost reductions for 2014 primarily reflected improvements in product and process technologies and the comparatively lower manufacturing costs of the mmj group partially offset by higher costs for product obtained under the inotera supply agreements for 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013 our costs of goods sold for dram products included the sale of the mmj groups inventories recorded at fair value in the mmj acquisition which was higher than the manufacturing cost of such inventories this increased our costs of goods sold by approximately 153 million for 2014 and 41 million for 2013our overall gross margin percentage improved to 20 for 2013 from 12 for 2012 due to improvements in the gross margin percentage for cnbu and to a lesser extent ebu sbu

sales of nor flash products for 2013 improved as compared to 2012 primarily due to cost reductions operating expenses and other selling general and administrativesgampa expenses for 2014 increased 26 as compared to 2013 primarily due to the incremental costs resulting from the mmj acquisition and higher payroll costs resulting primarily from the reinstatement of variable pay plans we expect that sgampa expenses will approximate 195 million to 205 million for the first quarter of 2015sgampa expenses for 2013 decreased 9 as compared to 2012 primarily due to a reduction in legal costs and lower variable pay costs partially offset by 50 million of consulting and other costs incurred in connection with the mmj acquisition research and developmentrampd expenses for 2014 increased 47 from 2013 primarily due to the incremental costs resulting from the mmj acquisition higher payroll costs resulting primarily from the reinstatement of variable pay plans and increased resources dedicated to

2013 increased 1 from 2012 primarily due to lower reimbursements from nanya under partnering arrangements offset by lower payroll costs primarily resulting from the suspension of variable pay plans and a lower volume of development wafers processed as a result of amounts reimbursable from intel under a joint development program for nand flash and certain emerging memory technologies rampd expenses were reduced by 137 million 127 million and 87 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively as a result of amounts reimbursable from nanya under a dram rampd joint development program rampd expenses were reduced by 19 million and 138 million for 2013 and 2012 respectively effective january 1 2013 nanya ceased participating in the dram joint development programour process technology rampd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rampd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and

offset by a 190 million benefit from increases in amount of mmj groups deferred tax assets expected to be realized based on our forecasted utilization of net operating losses the remaining tax provision for 2014 primarily reflects taxes on our other nonus operations the provision benefit for taxes on us operations for 2014 was substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowance as of august 28 2014 we had valuation allowances of 129 billion against substantially all us net deferred tax assets and 115 billion related to our foreign subsidiaries primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards our valuation allowance decreased 712 million for 2014 primarily due to the utilization of us and foreign net operating losses and due to the 190 million benefit to deferred tax assets of the mmj group the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if significant positive evidence increases management continues to evaluate future financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowances our unrecognized tax benefits increased 150 million in 2014 primarily due to transfer pricing and other matters which was substantially offset by changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowancewe currently operate in several tax jurisdictions where we have arrangements that allow us to compute our tax provision at rates below the local statutory rates that expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2026 these arrangements benefitted our tax provision in 2014 2013 and 2012 by 286 million 141 million and 52 million respectively income taxes for 2013 and 2012 primarily reflect taxes on our nonus operations offset by benefits of 19 million and 56 million

from operations and financing obtained from capital markets specifically in 2014 we generated cash from operations of 570 billion and obtained 221 billion of proceeds from issuance of debt cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products which can vary significantly from period to period we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently financing our capital expenditures dilutionmanagement activities including repurchases of convertible notes or equity and ongoing operations we expect from time to time in the future to engage in a variety of transactions for such purposes including the issuance or incurrence of secured and unsecured debt and the refinancing and restructuring of existing debton october 27 2014 we announced that our board of directors authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to100 billion of our outstanding common stock any repurchases under the new authorization may be made in open market purchases block trades privately negotiated transactions andor derivative transactions subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination that it is the best use of available cash we expect to use cash on hand to fund any repurchases the repurchase authorization does not obligate us to acquire any common stockwe expect that our cash and investments cash flows from operations and available financing

on the use of cash and investmentsmmj group  cash and equivalents and shortterm investments in the table above included an aggregate of 160 billion held by the mmj group as of august 28 2014 as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings of the mmj companies entered into in march 2012 and for so long as such proceedings are continuing the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies installment payments these prohibitions also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustee and japan court as a result the assets of the mmj group while available to satisfy the mmj companies installment payments and the other obligations capital expenditures and other operating needs of the mmj group are not available for use by us in our other operations moreover certain uses of the assets of the mmj group including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt may require consent of mmjs trustees andor the japan courtimft  cash and equivalents and shortterm investments in the table above included 84 million held by imft as of august 28 2014 our ability to access funds held by imft to finance our other operations is subject to agreement by intel and contractual limitations amounts held by imft are not anticipated to be available to finance our other operationsindefinitely reinvested  as of august 28 2014 we had 270 billion of cash and equivalents and shortterm investments that were held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the us would subject these funds to us federal income taxes determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries is not practicableoperating activitiesnet cash provided by operating activities was 570 billion for 2014 due primarily to a strong market for our products and our continued focus on costefficient operations operating cash flows in 2014 also benefitted by a 671 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by a 518 million increase in receivables 39investing activitiesnet cash used for investing activities was 245 billion for 2014 which consisted primarily of cash expenditures of 266 billion for property plant and equipment and 506 million for the acquisition of availableforsale securities net of proceeds from sales and maturities of 557 million offset by the use of 534 million of restricted cash in connection with the first mmj creditor installment paymentwe believe that to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and capital equipment and rampd we estimate that capital spending for 2015 will be approximately 36 billion to 40 billion the actual amounts for 2015 will vary depending on market conditions as of august 28 2014 we had commitments of approximately 118 billion for the acquisition of property plant and equipment substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one yearfinancing activitiesnet cash used by financing activities was 195 billion for 2014 which included 384 billion for repayments of debt including 120 billion for the amount in excess of principal of our convertible notes 479 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts and 92 million of net cash received from noncontrolling interests offset by 221 billion of proceeds from issuance of debt and by 265 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our equity plans2014 debt restructurethroughout 2014 we reduced the dilutive effects of our convertible notes by exchanging converting or repurchasing a portion of these notes using cash generated from operations and proceeds from issuing nonconvertible debt with near investmentgrade covenants approximately 90 of our free cash flow cash flows from operating activities less expenditures for property plant and equipment less payments on equipment purchase contracts generated during 2014 was used for these dilutionmanagement activities as a result we eliminated convertible notes that would have been converted into 118 million shares of our common stockin 2014 we initiated a series of actions to restructure our debt including exchanges

lease payments4 amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other longterm liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet including 335 million for the current portion of these longterm liabilities5 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities therefore 255 million in aggregate of longterm income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities has been excluded from the preceding table however other noncurrent liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet included these uncertain tax positions and noncurrent deferred tax liabilitiesthe obligations disclosed above do not include current liabilities except for the current portion of longterm debt the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services market prices changes to agreedupon amounts or timing of certain events for some obligationspurchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria 1 they are noncancellable 2 we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled or 3 we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services takeorpay if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancellable the entire value of the contract was included in the above table if the obligation is cancellable but we would incur a penalty if canceled the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation contracted minimum amounts specified in takeorpay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitmentunder the inotera supply agreement effective on january 1 2013 we are obligated to purchase for a threeyear term currently through december 2016 substantially all of inoteras output at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components the inotera supply agreement contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive oneyear extensions and if the parties do not agree to an extension the agreement will terminate following the end of the thenexisting term plus a subsequent threeyear winddown period in the event of a winddown our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the three year winddown period we purchased 268 billion of dram products from inotera in 2014 under the inotera supply agreement the inotera supply agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity as quantities are based on qualified production output and pricing fluctuates as it is based on market prices therefore we did not include our obligations under the inotera supply agreement in the contractual obligations table above 42offbalance sheet arrangementswe have entered into capped calls which are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution from our convertible notes the capped calls provide for our receipt of cash or shares at our election from our counterparties if the trading price of our stock is above a specified initial strike price at the expiration dates the amounts receivable varies based on the trading price of our stock up to specified cap prices the dollar value of the cash or shares that we would receive from the capped calls on their expiration dates ranges from 0 if the trading price of our stock is below the initial strike price for all of the capped calls to 864 million if the trading price of our stock is at or above the cap price for all of the capped calls to purchase the capped calls we paid 57 million in 2011 103 million in 2012 and 48 million in 2013 respectively the amounts paid were recorded as charges to additional capital for further details of our capped call arrangements see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  equity  micron shareholders equity  capped calls notecritical accounting estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgmentsbusiness acquisitions accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values the items involving the most significant assumptions estimates and judgments included determining the fair value of the followingproperty plant and equipment including determination of values in a continueduse modeldeferred tax assets including projections of future taxable income and tax ratesinventory including estimated future selling prices timing of product sales and completion costs for work in process anddebt including discount rate and timing of paymentsconsolidations we have interests in joint venture entities that are vies determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing 1 whether an entity is a vie and 2 if we are the entitys primary beneficiary to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we evaluate whether we have a the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding and financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies requires significant assumptions and judgmentcontingencies we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date in accounting for the resolution of contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution which are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods 43income taxes we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in recent periods our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and taiwan our income tax provision or benefit is dependent in part on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve numerous judgments including among others projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes manufacturing and overhead costs levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realizedinventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value cost includes labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated market values below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated market value of our memory inventory by approximately 254 million as of august 28 2014 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantlyus gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories inventories are primarily categorized as memory including dram nand flash and nor flash for purposes of determining lower of average cost or market the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and marketsproperty plant and equipment we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performedresearch and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rampd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are valued in inventorystockbased compensation  stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgmentdetermining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock 44recently issued
