probe we have an approximate 40 ownership in tera probe inc an entity that provides semiconductor probe and test services tera probe provides wafer probe services for our elpida and rexchip subsidiariesmanufacturingour manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china israel japan malaysia puerto rico singapore and taiwan our inotera joint venture also has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan in september 2013 we entered into an agreement to sell our 200mm wafer fabrication equipment in kiryat gat israel to intel and to terminate the related facility lease with intel if this transaction is completed intel will manufacture wafers for us at the kiryat gat facility through 2014 through a series of arrangements in 2011 we sold our wafer fabrication facility in japan to tower semiconductor ltd tower and entered into a supply agreement for tower to manufacture products for us in the facility through approximately may 2014 our manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment nand flash dram and nor flash products share common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment we continuously enhance our production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in 2013 the majority of our dram production was manufactured on 30nm linewidth process technology in connection with our acquisition of elpida we expect in 2014 that a significant portion of our dram production will be manufactured on 25nm linewidth process technology in the fourth quarter of 2013 a majority of our nand flash memory products were manufactured on our 20nm linewidth process technology we expect to begin transitioning our nand flash production to our 16nm linewidth process technology in 2014 our nor flash memory products in 2013 were manufactured on our 65nm and 45nm linewidth process technologies we manufacture all of our highvolume nand flash and dram products on 300mm wafers in 2013 we manufactured nor flash some specialty dram and nonmemory products on 200mm wafers 6wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionalitywe test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process perform high temperature burnin on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and costwe sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie bare die forms our packaged products include memory modules mcps managed nand ssds memory cards and usb devices we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases we outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment we contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture nand flash media products such as memory cards and usb devicesin recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines availability of raw materialsour operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases including helium photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedmarketing and customersour products are sold into computing consumer networking telecommunications automotive industrial and mobile markets market concentrations from 2013 net sales were approximately as follows computing including desktop pcs servers notebooks and workstations 30 mobile 15 consumer electronics 15 ssds 15 and networking and storage 10 sales to intel primarily nand flash products through im flash were 10 of our net sales in 2013 12 of our net sales in 2012 and 10 of our net sales in 2011 sales to hewlettpackard company primarily of dram were 10 of our net sales in 2013 8 of our net sales in 2012 and 9 of our net sales in 2011 we expect that our acquisition of elpida will increase our concentration of sales to mobile graphics and computing markets in 2014our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron lexar crucial spectek and elpida brand names and private labels we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world we sell lexarbranded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several monthsbacklogbecause of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding periodproduct warrantybecause the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery under our general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditionscompetitionwe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation sk hynix inc spansion inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices many of our highvolume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors for these highvolume memory products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factors for our other memory products the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence to pricingresearch and developmentour process technology rampd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies as well as new fundamentally different memory structures materials and packages which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rampd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram and mobile low power ddr dram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including mlc and tlc technologies nor flash memory specialty memory ssds hybrid memory cubes and other memory technologies and systemsour rampd expenses were 931 million 918 million and 791 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we generally share rampd process and design costs for nand flash with intel we also share rampd costs for certain emerging memory technologies with intel we generally shared rampd process and design costs for dram with nanya through december 2012 when our costsharing agreement was terminated as a result of reimbursements under our intel and nanya costsharing arrangements our overall rampd expenses were reduced by 146 million 225 million and 236 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 7to compete in the semiconductor memory industry we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions our process design and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world with our largest rampd centers located in boise idaho and hiroshima japan our largest design center is also located at our corporate headquarters in boise idaho we have several additional product design centers in other strategic locations around the world in 2012 we commenced operation of our new rampd facility in boise which was designed to accommodate 450mm wafer manufacturing in addition we develop photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boiserampd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rampd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualificationgeographic informationsales to customers outside the united states totaled 76 billion for 2013 and included 38 billion in sales in china 980 million in sales in taiwan 820 million in sales in europe 193 million in sales in malaysia and 13 billion in sales in the rest of the asia pacific region excluding china malaysia

events to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of uswe have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our businessif average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in recent years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future in some prior periods average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future  dram  trade nand flash  percentage change in average selling prices2013 from 2012 11  182012 from 2011 45  552011 from 2010 39  122010 from 2009 28  262009 from 2008 52  52 trade nand flash excludes sales to intel from im flash     we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at the rate average selling prices declineour gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes including reducing the die size of our existing products in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to improve or maintain gross margins factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes difficulty in transitioning to smaller linewidth process technologies technological barriers and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory productsthe semiconductor memory industry is highly competitivewe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation sk hynix inc spansion inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs transitions to smaller linewidth process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 12our acquisitions of elpida and rexchip involve numerous riskson july 31 2013 we completed the acquisition of elpida pursuant to the terms and conditions of the sponsor agreement that we entered into on july 2 2012 with the trustees of the elpida companies pursuant to and in connection with the elpida companies pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan we paid 615 million for the acquisition of 100 of elpidas equity on july 31 2013 we also acquired a 24 ownership interest in rexchip from the powerchip group pursuant to a share purchase agreement we paid 334 million in cash for the shares the elpida group owns approximately 65 of rexchips outstanding common stock therefore as a result of the consummation of our acquisition of elpida and the rexchip shares from the powerchip group we own approximately 89 of rexchips common stock the provisional fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include among other items cash and restricted cash aggregating 1618 million inventories of 962 million property plant and equipment of 935 million net deferred tax assets of 917 million and debt of 2134 millionin addition to the acquisition risks described elsewhere these acquisitions are expected to involve the following significant riskswe may be unable to maintain customers successfully execute our integration strategies or achieve planned synergieswe may be unable to accurately forecast the anticipated financial results of the combined businessour consolidated financial condition may be adversely impacted by the increased leverage resulting from the transactionsincreased exposure to the dram market which experienced significant declines in pricing during the first quarter of 2013 as well as 2012 and 2011deterioration of elpidas and rexchips operations and customer base following closingincreased exposure to operating costs denominated in yen and new taiwan dollarintegration issues with elpidas and rexchips primary manufacturing operations in japan and taiwanintegration issues of our product and process technology with elpida and rexchipintegration of business systems and processes andan overlap in customersour acquisitions of elpida and rexchip are inherently risky may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionthe operations of the elpida companies will be subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedingsbecause the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of elpida the japan proceedings are continuing and the elpida companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the japan proceedings the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the elpida companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petitionduring the pendency of the japan proceedings the elpida companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the elpida companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively integrate the elpida companies as part of our global operations or to cause the elpida companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the elpida companies 13our acquisitions of elpida and rexchip expose us to significant risks from changes in currency exchange ratesunder the sponsor agreement we committed to support plans of reorganization for elpida that provide for payments to the secured and unsecured creditors of elpida in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen the us dollar amount of this payment obligation could increase if the yen strengthens against the us dollar additionally a significant portion of elpidas and rexchips operating costs are paid in yen and new taiwan dollars so our operating results subsequent to the acquisition could also be adversely impacted if these currencies strengthen against the us dollarour acquisitions of elpida and rexchip may increase our risk of significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reportingelpida and rexchip have not performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the design and operation of their internal control over financial reporting in addition elpida and rexchip have not historically prepared their financial statements under us generally accepted accounting standards elpida and rexchip were not required to be included in our assessment of internal controls for 2013 but will be included in our assessment for 2014 which may increase our risk for material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reportingdebt obligations could adversely affect our financial conditionwe are engaged in a capital intensive business subject to significant changes in supply and demand and product pricing and recent periods of consolidation any of which could result in our incurrence or assumption of indebtedness in recent periods our debt levels have increased as of august 29 2013 we had 60 billion of debt including 485 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2014 as of august 29 2013 we had two credit facilities available that provides for up to 408 million of additional financing subject to outstanding balances of trade receivables and other conditions events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy the applicable drawdown conditions and utilize either of these facilities we have in the past and expect in the future to continue to incur additional debt to finance our capital investments including debt incurred in connection with assetbacked financingthe plans of reorganization of the elpida companies provide for payments by the elpida companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen or the equivalent of approximately 205 billion less certain expenses of the japan proceedings and certain other items if the resolution of certain unfixed claims under the plans of reorganization primarily comprised of outstanding litigation claims would result in payments in respect of those claims in excess of amounts reserved under the plans of reorganization to satisfy such claims there is a possibility that the elpida companies would be required to pay more than 200 billion yen to their prepetition creditors under the plans of reorganization in addition if these unfixed claims are resolved pursuant to settlement arrangements or other postpetition agreements a substantial portion of the amounts payable with respect to the claims may have to be funded by the elpida companies outside of the installment payments provided for by the plans of reorganizationour debt and our guarantee obligations could adversely impact us for example these obligations couldrequire us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions research and development expenditures and other business activities limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures strategic acquisitions or business opportunities research and development and other general corporate requirementscontribute to a future downgrade of our credit rating which could increase future borrowing costs andincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditionsour ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future this to some extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 14we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investmentsour cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rampd and product and process technology we estimate that capital spending for 2014 will be approximately 26 billion to 32 billion in addition as a result of the elpida acquisition we believe that our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels as we integrate our manufacturing operations and support the increase of capacity resulting from the elpida transaction as of august 29 2013 we had cash and equivalents of 2880 million shortterm investments of 221 million and longterm marketable investments of 499 million cash and investments included 1094 million held by elpida and its consolidated subsidiaries and 62 million held by im flash technologies llc imft none of which is generally available to finance our other operationsas a result of the japan proceedings for so long as such proceedings are continuing the elpida companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies prohibit the elpida companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the elpida companies installment payments these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the elpida companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the elpida companies as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the elpida companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the elpida companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the elpida companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court as a result the assets of the elpida companies and their subsidiaries while available to satisfy the elpida companies installment payments and the other obligations capital expenditures and other operating needs of the elpida companies and their subsidiaries are not available for use by us in our other operations moreover certain uses of the assets of the elpida companies including investments in certain capital expenditures and in rexchip may require consent of elpidas trustees andor the japan courtin the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our current debt levels expected debt amortization and general economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows use cash held by elpida to fund its capital expenditures access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt amortization payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operationsour inotera supply agreement involves numerous riskson january 17 2013 we entered into a new supply agreement with inotera the inotera supply agreement under which we are obligated to purchase substantially all of inoteras output at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks including the followinghigher costs for supply obtained under the marketbased provisions of the inotera supply agreementdifficulties and delays in ramping production at inotera and delays in the future anddifficulties in transferring technology to inoterainoteras financial situation may adversely impact the value of our interest and our supply agreementas of june 30 2013 inoteras current liabilities exceeded its current assets by 10 billion which exposes inotera to liquidity risk additionally inotera incurred net losses of 541 million for its fiscal year ended december 31 2012 as of june 30 2013 inotera was not in compliance with certain loan covenants and had not been in compliance for the past several years which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year inotera has applied for a waiver from complying with the june 30 2013 financial covenants inoteras management has implemented plans to improve its liquidity and for its sixmonth period ended june 30 2013 inotera generated net income of 91 million however there can be no assurance that inotera will be successful in sufficiently improving its liquidity and complying with their loan covenants which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year if inotera is unable to continue to improve its liquidity we may have to impair our investment in inotera 15on january 17 2013 we entered into agreements with nanya technology corporation nanya to amend the joint venture relationship involving inotera under the inotera supply agreement we purchase substantially all of inoteras output at a purchase price based on a discount from actual market prices for comparable components the inotera supply agreement was retroactively effective beginning on january 1 2013 for the fourth quarter of 2013 we purchased 518 million of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 50 of our aggregate dram gigabit production if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedchanges in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionacross our multinational operations there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the singapore dollar euro shekel and yen we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 229 million for 2013 6 million for 2012 and 6 million for 2011 based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities offset by balance sheet hedges we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 19 million as of august 29 2013 in the event that the us dollar weakens significantly compared to the singapore dollar euro shekel or yen our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affectedin connection with the elpida sponsor agreement and rexchip share purchase agreement we entered into currency hedges to mitigate the risk that increases in exchange rates have on our planned yen payments in 2013 we recognized losses of 228 million on these hedges and made payments of 222 million to settle these hedges as of august 29 2013 to hedge certain yendenominated payments resulting from our acquisition of elpida we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase 20 billion yen on november 28 2014 at a yen per us dollar exchange rate of 9853 and a forward contract to purchase 10 billion yen on november 27 2015 at a yen per us dollar exchange rate of 9725the financial crisis and overall downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our businessthe financial crisis and the overall downturn in the worldwide economy have had an adverse effect on our business a continuation or further deterioration of depressed economic conditions could have an even greater adverse effect on our business including any economic downturn resulting from the shutdown of the us federal government or any default by the us federal government on any of its debt or other obligations adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers networking products and mobile devices reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets would limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedwe may incur additional material restructure or other charges in future periodsin response to severe downturns in the semiconductor memory industry and global economic conditions we implemented restructure activities and may implement restructure initiatives in future periods we may restructure or dispose of assets as we continue to optimize our manufacturing operations including the winddown of 200millimeter wafer capacity as we migrate more products to 300millimeter wafer production as a result we could incur restructure charges including but not limited to severance and other termination benefits losses on disposition or impairment of equipment or other longlived assets and inventory write downs lose production output lose key personnel and experience disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products in connection with these actions we recorded 126 million in 2013 and may incur restructure charges or other losses associated with other initiatives in future periodswe may make future acquisitions andor alliances which involve numerous risksacquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the followingintegrating the operations technologies and products of

acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions technological advancements or worsethanexpected performance of the acquired businessin recent years supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram nand flash and nor flash products resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants including the liquidation of qimonda ag and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida memory inc these types of proceedings often lead to confidential courtdirected processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionour future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologiesour key semiconductor memory technologies of dram nand flash and nor flash face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability to meet these requirements we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance andor cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies  there can be no assurance of the followingthat we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory technologiesthat we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new productsthat we will be able to successfully market these technologies andthat margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development effortsif our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 17the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been legally challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimondaon january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimonda ag qimonda insolvency proceedings filed suit against us and micron semiconductor bv our netherlands subsidiary in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between us and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which we purchased all of qimondas shares of inotera memories inc and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer the inotera shares purchased from qimonda to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent cross license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement a threejudge panel will render a decision after a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses hearings were held on september 25 2012 february 5 2013 june 11 2013 and july 2 2013 an additional hearing is scheduled for november 12 2013 we are unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or equivalent monetary damages and the termination of the patent cross license which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as of august 29 2013 the inotera shares purchased from qimonda had a carrying value of 190 millionour joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous riskswe have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these relationships include our imft nand flash joint venture with intel corporation intel our inotera dram joint venture with nanya and our mp mask joint venture with photronics these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the followingour interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities or on the amount timing or nature of further investments in our joint venturewe may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventureswe may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint venturesour control over the operations of our joint ventures is limitedwe may recognize losses from equity investment inotera in our future results of operationsdue to financial constraints our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint

joint ventures which may result in higher levels of cash expenditures by uscash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirementswe may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partnersthe terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable andchanges in tax legal or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partnersif our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 18an adverse outcome relating to allegations of anticompetitive conduct could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionon may 5 2004 rambus inc rambus filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county against us and other dram suppliers which alleged that the defendants harmed rambus by engaging in concerted and unlawful efforts affecting rambus dram by eliminating competition and stifling innovation in the market for computer memory technology and computer memory chips rambus complaint alleged various causes of action under california state law including among other things a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices a conspiracy to monopolize intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and unfair competition rambus sought a judgment for damages of approximately 39 billion joint and several liability trebling of damages awarded punitive damages a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint interest and attorneys fees and costs trial began on june 20 2011 and the case went to the jury on september 21 2011 on november 16 2011 the jury found for us on all claims on april 2 2012 rambus filed a notice of appeal to the california 1st district court of appealwe are unable to predict the outcome of this matter an adverse court determination of any lawsuit alleging violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditionan adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionon january 13 2006 rambus filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california rambus alleges that certain of our ddr2 ddr3 rldram and rldram ii products infringe as many as fourteen rambus patents and seeks monetary damages treble damages and injunctive relief the accused products account for a significant portion of our net sales on june 2 2006 we filed an answer and counterclaim against rambus alleging among other things antitrust and fraud claims on january 9 2009 in another lawsuit involving us and rambus and involving allegations by rambus of patent infringement against us in the us district court for the district of delaware judge robinson entered an opinion in favor of us holding that rambus had engaged in spoliation and that the twelve rambus patents in the suit were unenforceable against us rambus subsequently appealed the delaware courts decision to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit on may 13 2011 the federal circuit affirmed judge robinsons finding of spoliation but vacated the dismissal sanction and remanded the case to the delaware district court for analysis of the remedy based on the federal circuits decision on january 2 2013 judge robinson entered a new opinion in our favor holding that rambus had engaged in spoliation that rambus spoliation was done in bad faith that the spoliation prejudiced us and that the appropriate sanction was to declare the twelve rambus patents in the suit unenforceable against us on march 27 2013 rambus filed a notice of appeal to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit the northern district of california court stayed the trial of the patent phase of the northern district of california case upon appeal of the spoliation issue to the federal circuit in addition others have asserted and may assert in the future that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights see item 1 legal proceedings for additional details on these lawsuitswe are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditionwe have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable termsproducts that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on usproducts that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following  19we may be required to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product or replace productswe could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages andwe may encounter adverse publicity which could cause a decrease in sales of our productsnew product development may be unsuccessfulwe are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop dram nand flash nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development effortsif our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedwe manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the us singapore taiwan japan israel and china additionally our control over operations at our imft inotera and mp mask and tera probe joint ventures is limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment and equipment failures if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionconsolidation of industry participants and governmental assistance to some of our competitors may contribute to uncertainty in the semiconductor memory industry and negatively impact our ability to competein recent years supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices of dram nand flash and nor flash products and substantial operating losses by us and our competitors the operating losses as well as limited access to sources of financing have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants and significant recent consolidation and in certain cases liquidation some of our competitors may try to enhance their capacity and lower their cost structure through consolidation in addition some governments have provided and may be considering providing significant financial assistance to some of our competitors consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantagethe limited availability of raw materials supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionour operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases including helium photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 20our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier in recent periods we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the suppliers limited capacity our inability to timely obtain this equipment could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp if we are unable to timely obtain advanced semiconductor equipment our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedour results of operations could be affected by natural

default risks including cash deposits investments foreign currency option and forward contracts and cappedcall contracts on our stock as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding in the event of such default we could incur significant losses which could adversely impact our business results of operations or financial condition compliance with new regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our productsincreased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act and its implementing sec regulations the doddfrank act imposes new supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo the drc and finance or benefit local armed groups these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing some of our customers

companieson july 31 2013 we completed the acquisition of elpida memory inc elpida a japanese corporation pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement on support for reorganization companies as amended the sponsor agreement that we entered into on july 2 2012 with the trustees of elpida and one of its subsidiaries akita elpida memory inc a japanese corporation akita and together with elpida the elpida companies pursuant to and in connection with the elpida companies pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan the elpida companies filed petitions for commencement of corporate reorganization proceedings with the tokyo district court the japan court under the corporate reorganization act of japan on february 27 2012 and the japan court issued an order to commence the reorganization proceedings the japan proceedings on march 23 2012 on july 2 2012 we entered into the sponsor agreement with the legal trustees of the elpida companies and the japan court approved the sponsor agreement under the sponsor agreement we agreed to provide certain support for the reorganization of the elpida companies and the trustees agreed to prepare and seek approval from the japan court and the elpida companies creditors of plans of reorganization consistent with such support 23the trustees initially submitted the proposed plans of reorganization for the elpida companies to the japan court on august 21 2012 and submitted final proposed plans on october 29 2012 on october 31 2012 the japan court approved submission of the trustees proposed plans of reorganization to creditors for approval on february 26 2013 the elpida companies creditors approved the reorganization plans and on february 28 2013 the japan court issued an order approving the plans of reorganization appeals filed by certain creditors of elpida in japan challenging the plan approval order issued by the japan court were deniedin a related action elpida filed a verified petition for recognition and chapter 15 relief in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the us court on march 19 2012 and on april 24 2012 the us court entered an order that among other things recognized elpidas corporate reorganization proceeding as a foreign main proceeding pursuant to 11 usc  1517b on june 25 2013 the us court issued a recognition order which recognized the order of the japan court approving elpidas plan of reorganizationthe plans of reorganization provide for payments by the elpida companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen or the equivalent of approximately 205 billion as of august 29 2013 less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items the plans of reorganization also provided for the investment by us pursuant to the sponsor agreement of 60 billion yen 615 million paid at closing in cash into elpida in exchange for 100 ownership of elpidas equity and the use of such investment to fund the initial installment payment by the elpida companies to their creditors of 60 billion yen subject to reduction for certain items specified in the sponsor agreement and plans of reorganization the initial installment payment was made to the creditors of the elpida companies in october 2013 the plans of reorganization also provide for 140 billion yen or the equivalent of approximately 143 billion as of august 29 2013 of additional payments by the elpida companies to their creditors to be paid in six annual installments beginning december 2014 with payments of 20 billion yen or the equivalent of approximately 205 million as of august 29 2013 in each of the first four annual installment payments and payments of 30 billion yen or the equivalent of approximately 307 million as of august 29 2013 in each of the final two annual installment paymentsunder the sponsor agreement we agreed that we would subject to certain conditions implement and maintain a cost plus model with the elpida companies in support of the execution of their plans of reorganization in connection with these commitments we entered into a series of costplus agreements with elpida and akita including supply agreements research and development services agreements and general services agreements the cost plus agreements the cost plus agreements are intended to generate more stable operating cash flows to meet the requirements of the elpida companies businesses including the funding of the installment payments to the elpida companies creditors we anticipate that once fully in effect payments we make under the cost plus agreements will generally cover all of elpida and akitas costs under elpidas plan of reorganization secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their fixed claims and unsecured creditors will recover at least 174 of the amount of their fixed claims the actual recovery of unsecured creditors will be higher however based in part on events and circumstances occurring following the plan approval the remaining portion of the unsecured claims will be discharged without payment over the period that payments are made pursuant to the plans of reorganization the secured creditors will be paid in full on or before the sixth installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments akitas plan of reorganization provides that secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their claims whereas unsecured creditors will recover 19 of the amount of their claims the secured creditors of akita will be paid in full on the first installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installmentscertain contingency matters related to the elpida companies which are primarily comprised of outstanding litigation claims were not treated as fixed claims under the plans of reorganization at the time the plans were filed with the japan court a portion of each installment amount payable to the creditors of the elpida companies will be reserved for use in the event that any of these matters become fixed claims in which case these fixed claims will be paid under the plans of reorganization in the same manner as the fixed claims of other creditors to the extent the aggregate amounts reserved from the installment payments exceed the aggregate amounts payable with respect to these unfixed claims once they become fixed the excess amounts reserved will be distributed to unsecured creditors with respect to their fixed claims resulting in an increased recovery for the unsecured creditors out of the installment payments to the extent the aggregate amounts reserved are less than the aggregate amounts payable with respect to these unfixed claims once they become fixed the elpida companies would be responsible to fund any shortfall to ensure that the creditors receive the minimum recovery to which they are entitled under the plans of reorganization with respect to these claims as a result there is a possibility that the total amount payable by the elpida companies to their creditors under the plans of reorganization will exceed 200 billion yen in addition certain of these unfixed claims may be resolved pursuant to settlement arrangements or other postpetition agreements and a substantial portion of the amounts payable under such agreements may have to be funded by the elpida companies outside of the plans of reorganization  24because the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of the elpida acquisition the japan proceedings are continuing and the elpida companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the reorganization proceedings the business trustee will make decisions in relation to the operation of the businesses of the elpida companies other than decisions in relation to acts that need to be carried out in connection with the japan proceedings which will be the responsibility of the legal trustee the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court will continue until the final creditor payment is made under the elpida companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date the elpida companies may petition the japan court for an early termination of the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made although such early terminations are customarily granted there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition in these particular cases during the pendency of the japan proceedings the elpida companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling material disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the elpida companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively integrate the elpida companies as part of our global operations or to cause the elpida companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the elpida companiespatent matterson august 28 2000 we filed a complaint against rambus inc rambus in the us district court for the district of delaware
