business see item 1  business  overview our results of operations for 2013 were affected by the following key transactions and events acquisition of elpida memory incon july 31 2013 we completed our acquisition of elpida memory inc elpida a japanese corporation pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement on support for reorganization companies as amended the sponsor agreement that we entered into on july 2 2012 with the trustees of elpida and one of its subsidiaries akita elpida memory inc a japanese corporation akita and together with elpida the elpida companies pursuant to and in connection with the elpida companies pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan we paid 615 million for the acquisition of 100 of elpidas equity on july 31 2013 we also acquired a 24 ownership interest in rexchip electronics corporation rexchip a taiwanese corporation and manufacturing joint venture formed by powerchip technology corporation powerchip and elpida from powerchip and certain of its affiliates the powerchip group pursuant to a share purchase agreement we paid 334 million in cash for the shares elpida and its subsidiaries the elpida group own approximately 65 of rexchips outstanding common stock therefore as a result of the consummation of our acquisition of elpida and the rexchip shares from the powerchip group we own approximately 89 of rexchips common stock the provisional fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include among other items cash and restricted cash aggregating 1618 million inventories of 962 million property plant and equipment of 935 million net deferred tax assets of 917 million and debt of 2134 millionelpidas assets include among others a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in hiroshima japan its ownership interest in rexchip whose assets include a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in taichung city taiwan and an assembly and test facility located in akita japan the elpida and rexchip fabrication facilities together represent approximately onethird of our wafer capacityelpidas semiconductor memory products include mobile dram targeted toward mobile phones and tablets we believe that combining the complementary product portfolios of micron and elpida strengthens our position in the memory market and enables us to provide customers with a wider portfolio of highquality memory solutions we also believe that the elpida transaction strengthens our market position in the memory industry through increased research and development and manufacturing scale improved access to core memory market segments and additional wafer capacity to balance among our dram nand flash and nor flash memory solutions elpidas operations are included primarily in the dsg and wsg segments our results of operations for 2013 included approximately one month of operating results from the elpida operations which accounted for sales of 355 million and net income of 29 millionthe elpida companies are currently subject to corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan both of the elpida companies have adopted plans of reorganization which set forth the treatment of the elpida companies prepetition creditors and their claims which plans were approved by the elpida companies creditors and the tokyo district court in february 2013 the plans of reorganization provide for payments by the elpida companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen or the equivalent of approximately 205 billion as of august 29 2013 less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items the plans of reorganization provide for the elpida companies prepetition creditors to be paid in seven installments the initial installment payment of 60 billion yen 615 million as of august 29 2013 which amount is subject to reduction for certain items specified in the sponsor agreement and plans of reorganization was paid in october 2013 substantially all of the 615 million that we paid in connection with the elpida acquisition was deposited into accounts that are legally restricted for payment to the secured and unsecured creditors of elpida in october 2013 and was presented as restricted cash in the amount of 556 million on our august 29 2013 balance sheet the remaining 140 billion yen or the equivalent of approximately 143 billion as of august 29 2013 of installment payments payable to the elpida companies creditors are scheduled to be made by the elpida companies in six annual installments payable beginning on december 31 2014 pursuant to the terms of the sponsor agreement we entered into a series of agreements with the elpida companies including supply agreements research and development services agreements and general services agreements which are intended to generate more stable operating cash flows to meet the requirements of the elpida companies businesses including the funding of the installment payments to the elpida companies creditors we anticipate that once fully in effect payments made under these agreements will generally cover all of elpida and akitas costs 35to mitigate the risk from the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the proposed elpida acquisition we entered into a series of currency exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to yen and new taiwan dollar payments the elpida hedges these currency exchange contracts were not designated for hedge accounting and were remeasured at fair value each period with gains and losses recognized in other operating income expense as a result of marktomarket adjustments for the elpida hedges we recorded losses to other nonoperating expense of 228 million in 2013 as of august 29 2013 our cumulative loss on the elpida hedges was 220 millionsee item 8 financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements  acquisition of elpida memory inc for further details of the acquisitioninotera memories incon january 17 2013 we entered into agreements with nanya technology corporation nanya to amend the joint venture relationship involving inotera the amendments included a new supply agreement the inotera supply agreement retroactively beginning on january 1 2013 between us and inotera under which we are obligated to purchase for an initial threeyear term substantially all of inoteras output at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components the inotera supply agreement contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive oneyear extensions and if in any year the parties do not agree to an extension the agreement will terminate following the end of the thenexisting term plus a subsequent threeyear winddown period our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the three year winddown period effective through december 31 2012 we had rights and obligations to purchase 50 of inoteras wafer production capacity based on a marginsharing formula among nanya inotera and us our cost for product purchased from inotera under the supply agreements was 1260 million for 2013 646 million for 2012 and 641 million for 2011under a costsharing arrangement effective through december 31 2012 we generally shared dram process and design development costs with nanya as a result of the january 17 2013 agreements which were retroactively effective beginning on january 1 2013 nanya no longer participates in the joint development program pursuant to this

compared to 46 for 2012 and 33 for 2011 as of june 30 2013 inoteras current liabilities exceeded its current assets by 10 billion which exposes inotera to liquidity risk additionally inotera incurred net losses of 541 million for its fiscal year ended december 31 2012 as of june 30 2013 inotera was not in compliance with certain of its loan covenants and had not been in compliance for the past several years which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year inotera has applied for a waiver from complying with the june 30 2013 financial covenants inoteras management has implemented plans to improve its liquidity and for inoteras sixmonth period ended june 30 2013 inotera generated net income of 91 million however there can be no assurance that inotera will be successful in sufficiently improving its liquidity and complying with their loan covenants which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next yearour gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2013 improved from 2012 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions as a result of improvements in product and process technology partially offset by

our gigabit production and sales volumes of dram products will increase significantly in 2014 due to our acquisition of elpida elpida has 300mm wafer fabrication facilities in japan and taiwan that are dedicated to the production of dram products we expect that dram products produced by the acquired elpida facilities will constitute over half of our aggregate dram gigabit production in the first quarter of 2014 and result in significant increases in dsg and wsg dram sales in accounting for the elpida acquisition elpidas inventories were recorded at fair value based on their estimated future selling prices estimated costs to complete and other factors which was approximately 200 million higher than the cost of inventory recorded by elpida prior to the acquisition of this amount

and costs of underutilized capacityoperating expenses and other selling general and administrativeselling general and administrative sgampa expenses for 2013 decreased 9 as compared to 2012 primarily due to a reduction in legal costs and lower variable pay costs partially offset by 50 million of consulting legal and other costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of elpida 41sgampa expenses for 2012 increased 5 as compared to 2011 primarily due to a 13 million contribution to a university program and stockbased compensation and other amounts related to the death benefits of our

developmentrampd expenses for 2013 increased 1 from 2012 primarily due to lower reimbursements from nanya under partnering arrangements offset by lower payroll costs primarily resulting from the suspension of variable pay plans and a lower volume of development wafers processed rampd expenses for 2012 increased 16 from 2011 primarily due to a higher volume of development wafers processed higher personnel costs associated with increased salary and wage rates and additional headcount for our expanded rampd operations and higher software and materials costsas a result of amounts reimbursable from nanya under a dram rampd costsharing arrangement rampd expenses were reduced by 19 million 138 million and 141 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the april 6 2012 agreements with intel expanded our nand flash rampd costsharing agreement to include certain emerging memory technologies but did not change the costsharing percentage as a result of amounts reimbursable from intel rampd expenses were reduced by 127 million 87 million and 95 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively effective january 1 2013 nanya ceased participating in the joint development program we

the closing of the acquisition we estimated the provisional fair value of the assets and liabilities of elpida as of july 31 2013 using an inuse model which reflects its value through its use in combination with other assets as a group these provisional amounts could change as additional information become available these changes could result in material variances between the combined entitys future financial results including variances in fair values recorded as well as expenses associated with these itemsdetermination of provisional fair values for the assets and liabilities acquired in the elpida acquisition required significant assumptions estimates and judgments many of the measurements involved significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a level 3

are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies prohibit the elpida companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the elpida companies installment payments these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the elpida companies from paying cash dividends to us as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the elpida companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the elpida companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the

us to pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes upon conversion these notes become convertible at the option of the holders if the closing price of our common stock for the required periods is above prices ranging from 1235 to 1421 none of these convertible notes met the conversion criteria through the calendar quarter ended june 30 2013 of the notes that require us to pay cash up to the

during september 2013 through october 28 2013 none of the 2031a or 2031b notes had been converted by holders we do not believe the amounts converted if any would be significant since the note holders would forgo the time value of the embedded conversion option we may elect in future periods to redeem convertible notes eligible for redemptionoperating activitiesnet cash provided by operating activities was 1811 million for 2013 which reflected approximately 2177 million generated from the production and sales of our products net of a 366 million effect from increases in the amount

and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgmentsbusiness acquisitions accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values the items involving the most significant assumptions estimates and judgments included determining the fair value of the followingproperty plant and equipment including determination of values in a continueduse modeldeferred tax assets including projections of future taxable income and tax ratesinventory including estimated future selling prices timing of product sales and completion costs for work in process anddebt including discount rate and timing of paymentsconsolidations we have interests in joint venture entities that are variable interest entities vies determining whether to consolidate a vie may require judgment in assessing 1 whether an entity is a vie and 2 if we are the entitys primary beneficiary to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we evaluate whether we have a the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding and financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies requires significant assumptions and judgmentcontingencies we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet dateincome taxes we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 49inventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value cost includes labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated market values below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated market value of our memory inventory by approximately 154 million as of august 29 2013 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantlyus gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories our inventories have been generally categorized as dram nand flash and nor flash memory the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and marketsproperty plant and equipment we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performedresearch and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rampd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are valued in inventorystockbased compensation  stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fairvalue of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgmentdetermining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stockrecently issued accounting standardsthere have been no recently issued accounting pronouncements that have had or are expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 50
