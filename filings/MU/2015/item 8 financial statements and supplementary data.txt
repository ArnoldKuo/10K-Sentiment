investments  inotera4tera probe we have an approximate 40 ownership interest in tera probe an entity that provides semiconductor wafer testing and probe services to us and others 4manufacturingour manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china japan malaysia singapore and taiwan our inotera joint venture has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment dram nand flash and nor flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines in 2015 we began construction of a significant expansion of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore for production of nand flash memoryour process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment we continuously enhance our production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in 2015 the majority of our dram production was manufactured on our 25nm linewidth process technologies we expect that by the second half of 2016 the majority of our dram production will be manufactured on our 20nm linewidth process technology in 2015 a majority of our nand flash production was manufactured on our 20nm and 16nm linewidth process technology we began production of 3d nand flash products in 2015 and expect that in 2016 the majority of our nand flash production will be manufactured using 16nm linewidth process technology or 3d nand technologywafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionalitywe test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process perform high temperature burnin on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and costwe sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie bare die forms our packaged products include memory modules ssds mcps managed nand memory cards usb devices and hmcs we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment we contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing companies to manufacture nand flash media products such as memory cards and usb devicesin recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 5availability of raw materialsour operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability and increase the cost of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we andor our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedmarketing and customersour products are sold into compute and graphics mobile ssd and other storage automotive industrial medical and other embedded and server markets market concentrations from 2015 net sales were approximately as follows 25 for compute and graphics including desktop pcs notebooks and workstations 25 for mobile 20 for ssd and other storage 15 for server and 10 for automotive industrial medical and other embedded sales to kingston primarily dram were 11 of our net sales in 2015 and 10 of our net sales in 2014 sales to intel primarily nand flash products through imft were 8 of our net sales in 2015 8 of our net sales in 2014 and 10 of our net sales in 2013 sales to hp primarily dram were 7 of our net sales in 2015 9 of our net sales in 2014 and 10 of our net sales in 2013our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron lexar crucial spectek and elpida brand names and private labels we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world we sell lexarbranded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several monthsbacklogbecause of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding periodproduct warrantybecause the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery under our general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions 6competitionwe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation sk hynix inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices many of our highvolume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors for these highvolume memory products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factors for our other memory products the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence over pricingresearch and developmentour process technology rampd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies as well as new fundamentally different memory structures materials and packages which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rampd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram and lpdram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including 3d nand and mlc and tlc technologies 3d xpoint memory nor flash memory specialty memory ssds hmcs and other memory technologies and systemsour rampd expenses were 154 billion 137 billion and 931 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand flash memory and 3d xpoint memory our rampd expenses reflect net reductions of 231 million 162 million and 176 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of reimbursements under our intel and other costsharing arrangementsto compete in the semiconductor memory industry we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions our process design and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world with our largest rampd center located in boise idaho and other significant rampd centers in japan china and other sites in the us in addition we develop photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boiserampd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rampd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualificationgeographic informationsales to customers outside the united states totaled 1363 billion for 2015 and included sales of 666 billion in china 224 billion in taiwan 125 billion in europe 103 billion in japan and 204 billion in the rest of the asia pacific region excluding china japan and taiwan sales to customers outside

that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments such as china have provided and may continue to provide significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs transitions to smaller linewidth process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply in recent periods we and some of our competitors have begun construction on or announced plans to build new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 11debt obligations could adversely affect our financial conditionin recent periods our debt levels have increased due to the capital intensive nature of our business business acquisitions and restructuring of our capital structure as of september 3 2015 we had debt with a carrying value of 734 billion in addition the conversion value in excess of principal amount for our convertible notes outstanding as of september 3 2015 was 553 million in 2015 we paid 143 billion to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of 489 million in 2014 we paid 230 billion to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of 109 billion as of september 3 2015 we had 1 revolving credit facilities available that provide for up to 842 million of additional financing and 2 a term loan agreement available to obtain financing collateralized by certain property plant and equipment in the amount of 690 billion new taiwan dollars or an equivalent amount in us dollars approximately 213 million as of september 3 2015 of which we drew 40 million in 2015 the availability of these revolving and other facilities is subject to certain conditions including outstanding balances of trade receivables inventories collateralization of certain property plant and equipment and other conditions events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy these applicable drawdown conditions and utilize these facilities we have in the past and expect in the future to continue to incur additional debt to finance our capital investments business acquisitions and restructuring of our capital structureour debt obligations could adversely impact us for example these obligations couldrequire us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions rampd expenditures and other business activitiescontinue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notesrequire us to continue to pay cash amounts substantially in excess of the principal amounts upon settlement of our convertible notes to minimize dilution of our earnings per share limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures strategic acquisitions or business opportunities rampd and other general corporate requirementsadversely impact our credit rating which could increase future borrowing costs andincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditionsour ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future this to some extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditionwe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investmentsour cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rampd and product and process technology we estimate that cash expenditures in 2016 for property plant and equipment will be approximately 53 billion to 58 billion investments in capital expenditures for 2015 were 412 billion in addition as a result of the mmj acquisition and our capacity expansion in singapore we expect our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels as of september 3 2015 we had cash and marketable investments of 563 billion which included 748 million held by the mmj group and 134 million held by imft none of which is generally available to finance our other operations 12as a result of the japan proceedings for so long as such proceedings are continuing the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies installment payments these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the mmj companies as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court as a result the assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries while available to satisfy the mmj companies installment payments and the other obligations capital expenditures and other operating needs of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are not available for use by us in our other operations furthermore certain uses of the assets of the mmj group including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt may require consent of mmjs trustees andor the japan courtin the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our debt levels expected debt amortization and general economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditionsthe acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimondaon january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimonda insolvency proceedings filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor bv our netherlands subsidiary micron bv in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron bv and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron bv purchased substantially all of qimondas shares of inotera memories inc the inotera shares representing approximately 55 of our total shares in inotera as of september 3 2015 and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks among other things to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent crosslicense between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreementfollowing a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate on march 13 2014 the court issued judgments 1 ordering micron bv to pay approximately 1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase 2 ordering micron bv to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties 3 ordering micron bv to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares including in particular any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits 4 denying qimondas claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera and 5 determining that qimondas obligations under the patent crosslicense agreement are canceled in addition the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering among other things 1 that micron bv transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by it and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties and 2 that micron bv pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares the interlocutory judgments have no immediate enforceable effect on us and accordingly we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case we have filed a notice of appeal and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court the next hearing on the matter has not yet been scheduledwe are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron bv from the ownership of the inotera shares andor the termination of the patent crosslicense which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as of september 3 2015 the inotera shares had a carrying value for purposes of our financial reporting of 683 million and a market value of 846 million 13our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologiesour key semiconductor memory technologies of dram nand flash and nor flash face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability to meet these requirements we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance andor cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies  there can be no assurance of the followingthat we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory technologiesthat we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new productsthat we will be able to successfully market these technologies andthat margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development effortsin the fourth quarter of 2015 we announced the development of new 3d xpoint technology which is an entirely new class of nonvolatile memory there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market this new product technology will be successful if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affectednew product development may be unsuccessfulwe are developing new products including systemlevel memory products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop dram nand flash nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance of the followingthat our product development efforts will be successfulthat we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new productsthat we will be able to successfully market these products orthat margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development effortsif our efforts to develop new products are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affectedproducts that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on usproducts that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways including the followingwe may be required to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product or replace productswe could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages andwe may encounter adverse publicity which could cause a decrease in sales of our products 14a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionas is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see part ii financial information  item 8 financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements  contingencieswe have a number of intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable termsour joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous riskswe have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these relationships include our imft joint venture with intel our inotera joint venture with nanya and our mp mask joint venture with photronics these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the followingour interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities or on the amount timing or nature of further investments in our joint ventureour joint venture partners products may compete with our productswe may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventureswe may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint venturesour control over the operations of our joint ventures is limitedwe may recognize losses from our equity method investmentsdue to financial constraints our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with themdue to differing business models or longterm business goals our partners may decide not to join us in funding capital investment in our joint ventures which may result in higher levels of cash expenditures by uscash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirementswe may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partnersthe terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable andchanges in tax legal or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partnersif our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affectedif our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedwe manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the us singapore taiwan japan malaysia and china additionally our control over operations at imft inotera mp mask and tera probe is limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment equipment failures earthquakes or other environmental events if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships any of which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 15the operations of the mmj companies are subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedingsbecause the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj the japan proceedings are continuing and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the japan proceedings the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petitionduring the pendency of the japan proceedings the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively integrate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companiesour inotera supply agreements involves numerous riskssince january 2013 we have purchased all of inoteras dram output at a price reflecting a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement in the second quarter of 2015 we executed a supply agreement to be effective beginning on january 1 2016 the 2016 supply agreement which will replace the current agreement under the 2016 supply agreement the price for dram products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us the 2016 supply agreement has an initial twoyear term followed by a threeyear winddown period and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a twoyear extension and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive oneyear extensions upon termination of the initial twoyear term of the 2016 supply agreement or any extensions we would purchase dram from inotera during the winddown period our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period our inotera supply agreements involve numerous risks including the followinghigher costs for supply obtained under the inotera supply agreements as compared to our whollyowned facilitiesdifficulties and delays in ramping production at inoteradifficulties in transferring technology to inotera anddifficulties in coming to an agreement with nanya regarding major corporate decisions such as capital expenditures or capital structurein 2015 and in 2014 our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to the pricing formula of the current agreement and strong market conditions for 2015 we purchased 237 billion of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 35 of our aggregate dram gigabit production if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 16changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionacross our global operations there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the british pound euro shekel singapore dollar new taiwan dollar yen and yuan we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 27 million for 2015 28 million for 2014 and 229 million for 2013 based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities offset by balance sheet hedges we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 3 million as of september 3 2015 in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies exchange rates for some of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the yen have been volatile in recent periods if these currencies strengthen against the us dollar our manufacturing costs could significantly increase in the event that exchange rates for the us dollar adversely change against our foreign currency exposures our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affectedwe may make future acquisitions andor alliances which involve numerous risksacquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the followingintegrating the operations technologies and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operationsincreasing capital expenditures

human resource or other policies or practices andimpairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions technological advancements or worsethanexpected performance of the acquired businessin previous years supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram nand flash and nor flash products resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants including the liquidation of qimonda and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida now known as mmj these types of proceedings often lead to courtdirected processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionbreaches of our network security could expose us to losseswe manage and store on our network systems various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations we also process store and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees including sensitive personal information unauthorized users may be able to gain access to our network system and steal proprietary information compromise confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and could expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers suppliers or employees is compromised 17compliance with regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our productsincreased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act and its implementing securities and exchange commission regulations the doddfrank act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo the drc and finance or benefit local armed groups these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict freewe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposurewe operate in a number of locations outside the us including in singapore and to a lesser extent taiwan where we have tax incentive agreements that are in part conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the distribution of our earnings among these different jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including challenges by tax authorities to our tax structure income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements and changes in tax laws and regulations we file income tax returns with the us federal government various us states and various other jurisdictions throughout the world our us federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2011 through 2015 in addition tax returns open to examination in multiple other taxing jurisdictions range from the years 2007 to 2015 the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilitywe may not utilize all of our net deferred tax assetswe have substantial deferred tax assets which include among others net operating loss and credit carryforwards as of september 3 2015 our us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards including uncertain tax benefits were 402 billion and 205 billion respectively which if not utilized will expire at various dates from 2016 through 2035 as of september 3 2015 our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were 515 billion including 381 billion pertaining to japan which if not utilized substantially all will expire at various dates from 2017 through 2025 as of september 3 2015 we had valuation allowances of 116 billion and 710 million against our net deferred tax assets in the us and japan respectivelythe limited availability of raw materials supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionour operations require raw materials and in certain cases third party services that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as silicon wafers controllers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we andor our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials or services is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 18our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the suppliers limited capacity our inability to obtain this equipment timely could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp if we are unable to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affecteda downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our businessdownturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers mobile devices solidstate drives and servers reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result our business

performance obligations a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may

recognition and chapter 15 relief in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the us court on march 19 2012 and on april 24 2012 the us court entered an order that among other things recognized mmjs corporate reorganization proceeding as a foreign main proceeding pursuant to 11 usc  1517b on june 25 2013 the us court issued a recognition order which recognized the order of the japan court approving mmjs plan of reorganization on november 19 2013 the us court closed the us chapter 15 proceedingthe plans of reorganization provide for payments by the mmj companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items the plans of reorganization also provided for the investment by us pursuant to the sponsor agreement of 60 billion yen 615 million paid at closing in cash into mmj in exchange for 100 ownership of mmjs equity and the use of such investment to fund the initial installment payment by the mmj companies to their creditors of 60 billion yen subject to reduction for certain items specified in the sponsor agreement and plans of reorganizationunder mmjs plan of reorganization secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their fixed claims and unsecured creditors will recover at least 174 of the amount of their fixed claims the actual recovery of unsecured creditors will be higher however based in part on events and circumstances occurring following the plan approval the remaining portion of the unsecured claims will be discharged without payment over the period that payments are made pursuant to the plans of reorganization the secured creditors will be paid in full on or before the sixth installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments mais plan of reorganization provides that secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their claims whereas unsecured creditors will recover 19 of the amount of their claims the secured creditors of mai were paid in full on the first installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments 21because the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of the mmj acquisition the japan proceedings are continuing and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the reorganization proceedings the business trustee makes decisions in relation to the operation of the businesses of the mmj companies other than decisions in relation to acts that need to be carried out in connection with the japan proceedings which are the responsibility of the legal trustee the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court will continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date the mmj companies may petition the japan court for an early termination of the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made although such early terminations are customarily granted there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition in these particular casesduring the pendency of the japan proceedings the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling material disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively integrate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companiesfor a discussion of other legal proceedings see part ii financial information  item 8

purchased all of inoteras dram output at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement in the second quarter of 2015 we executed a supply agreement to be effective beginning on january 1 2016 the 2016 supply agreement which will replace the current agreement under the 2016 supply agreement the price for dram products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us the 2016 supply agreement has an initial twoyear term followed by a threeyear winddown period and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a twoyear extension and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive oneyear extensions upon termination of the initial twoyear term of the 2016 supply agreement or any extensions we would purchase dram from inotera during the winddown period our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period in 2015 and 2014 our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to the pricing formula of the current agreement and strong market conditions under the

2013 primarily due to improvements in the gross margin percentage for cnbu and mbu as a result of higher margins for dram products the gross margin improvements for cnbu and mbu for 2014 as compared to 2013 resulted primarily from the mmj acquisition manufacturing cost reductions and higher average selling prices for cnbu our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to reductions in costs and increases in average selling prices cost reductions for 2014 primarily reflected improvements in product and process technologies and the comparatively lower manufacturing costs of the mmj group partially offset by higher costs for product obtained under the inotera supply agreement for 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013 our costs of goods sold for dram products included the sale of the mmj groups inventories recorded at fair value in the mmj acquisition which was higher than the manufacturing cost of such inventories this

despite our continued preparation of fabrication facilities for production of the next technology node which constrained output dram gigabit production growth in 2015 was also impacted by a shift to a higher mix of mobile and ddr4 products which have larger die sizes and therefore produce fewer bits per wafer the increase in gigabit sales of dram products for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher production volumes resulting from the mmj acquisition increased supply under the inotera supply agreement and improved product and process technologies partially offset by the transition

customers for 2014 as compared to 2013 were primarily due to the transition of our wafer fabrication facility in singapore from dram to nand flash production and improvements in product and process technologies  our gross margin percentage on sales of trade nand flash products for 2015 declined from 2014 as the declines in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions resulting from improvements in product and process technologies our gross margin percentage on sales of trade nand flash products for 2014 was relatively unchanged from 2013 as manufacturing cost reductions offset declines in average selling prices manufacturing cost reductions for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily resulted from improvements in product and process technologies 31operating expenses and other selling general and administrativesgampa expenses for 2015 increased 2 as compared to 2014 primarily due to an additional week in 2015 and higher legal costssgampa expenses for 2014 increased 26 as compared to 2013 primarily due to the incremental costs resulting from the mmj acquisition and higher payroll costs resulting primarily from the reinstatement of variable pay plans research and developmentrampd expenses for 2015 increased 12 from 2014 primarily due to a higher volume of development wafers processed an increase in depreciation expense due to rampd capital expenditures higher payroll costs higher subcontracted engineering and other professional service costs and an additional week in 2015 increases in rampd expenses for 2015 as compared to 2014 were partly attributable to increased spending on controllers firmware and engineering to support system level products including ssd managed nand flash and hmc products rampd expenses for 2014 increased 47 from 2013 primarily due to the incremental costs resulting from the mmj acquisition higher payroll costs resulting primarily from the reinstatement of variable pay plans and increased resources dedicated to development efforts we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand flash memory and 3d xpoint memory our rampd expenses reflect net reductions of 231 million 162 million and 176 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of reimbursements under our intel and other costsharing arrangementsour process technology rampd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rampd

output at prices reflecting a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement in the second quarter of 2015 we executed the 2016 supply agreement to be effective beginning on january 1 2016 which will replace the current agreement under the 2016 supply agreement the price for dram products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us in 2015 and in 2014 our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to the pricing formula of the current agreement and strong market conditions under the market conditions prevailing in the fourth quarter of 2015 costs of products purchased under the current agreement were higher than they would have been under the pricing formula of the 2016 supply agreement 33other operating and nonoperatingin 2014 we settled all pending litigation between us and rambus including all

from operations of 521 billion in 2015 and 570 billion in 2014 cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products which can vary significantly from period to period we obtained 250 billion from debt and lease financing in 2015 and 223 billion in 2014 as of september 3 2015 we had 1 revolving credit facilities available that provide for up to 842 million of additional financing based on eligible receivables and inventories and 2 a term loan agreement available to obtain financing collateralized by certain property plant and equipment in the amount of 690 billion new taiwan dollars or an equivalent amount in us dollars approximately 213 million as of september 3 2015 of which we drew 40 million on june 18 2015 we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures dilutionmanagement activities including repurchases of convertible notes and our common stock and ongoing operations we expect from time to time in the future to engage in a variety of transactions for such purposes including the issuance or incurrence of secured and unsecured debt and the refinancing and restructuring of existing debtto develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and equipment and rampd as a result of the mmj acquisition and our expansion in singapore we expect our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels we estimate that cash expenditures in 2016 for property plant and equipment will be approximately 53 billion to 58 billion which includes amounts we expect to be funded by our partners the actual amounts for 2016 will vary depending on market conditions investments in capital expenditures for 2015 were 412 billion total additions to property plant and equipment were 446 billion which in comparison to cash expenditures reflects differences in timing of receipts and payments for equipment as well as noncash additions such as equipment leases as of september 3 2015 we had commitments of approximately 162 billion for the acquisition of property plant and equipment substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year 34in december 2014 we announced plans to add approximately 255000 square feet of clean room space to our fabrication facility in singapore this expansion facilitates efficient implementation of 3d nand flash production at the singapore facility and gives us the flexibility to gradually add incremental capacity in response to market requirements construction of the additional space began in 2015 with initial manufacturing output likely in 2017 subject to market conditions we estimate capital expenditures of approximately 193 billion in 2016 related to this facilitysince the first quarter of 2015 our board of directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to 125

market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement in the second quarter of 2015 we executed the 2016 supply agreement to be effective beginning on january 1 2016 which will replace the current agreement under the 2016 supply agreement the price for dram products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us the 2016 supply agreement has an initial twoyear term followed by a threeyear winddown period and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a twoyear extension and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive oneyear extensions upon termination of the initial twoyear term of the 2016 supply agreement or any extensions we would purchase dram from inotera during the winddown period our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period we purchased 237 billion of dram products from inotera in 2015 under the current agreement the current agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity as quantities are based on qualified production output and pricing fluctuates as it is based on market prices therefore we did not include any amounts under the current agreement in the contractual obligations table above under the 2016 supply agreement payments are primarily based on fluctuating quantities and prices but a portion of the expected costs under the agreement meet the criteria of a minimum lease payment under an operating lease and are included in the table above offbalance sheet arrangementswe have entered into capped calls which are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution from our convertible notes the capped calls provide for our receipt of cash or shares at our election from our counterparties if the trading price of our stock is above a specified initial strike price at the expiration dates the amounts receivable varies based on the trading price of our stock up to specified cap prices the dollar value of the cash or shares that we would receive from the capped calls on their expiration dates ranges from 0 if the trading price of our stock is below the initial strike price for all of the capped calls to 814 million if the trading price of our stock is at or above the cap price for all of the capped calls we paid 57 million in 2011 103 million in 2012 and 48 million in 2013 to purchase capped calls the

to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgmentsbusiness acquisitions accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values the items involving the most significant assumptions estimates and judgments included determining the fair value of the followingproperty plant and equipment including determination of values in a continueduse modeldeferred tax assets including projections of future taxable income and tax ratesinventory

methodology estimations of future revenue and costs profit allocation rates attributable to the acquired technology and discount rates 38consolidations we have interests in joint venture entities that are vies determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing whether an entity is a vie and if we are the entitys primary beneficiary to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies requires significant assumptions and judgmentcontingencies we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date in accounting for the resolution of contingencies considerable judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periodsincome taxes we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in recent periods our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and taiwan our income tax provision or benefit is dependent in part on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve numerous judgments including among others projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes manufacturing and overhead costs levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realizedinventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value cost includes depreciation labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining net realizable value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting future average selling prices sales volumes and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated net realizable value below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our memory inventory by approximately 195 million as of september 3 2015 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantlyus gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories inventories are primarily categorized as memory including dram nonvolatile and other memory for purposes of determining lower of average cost or net realizable value the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and marketsproperty plant and equipment we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 39research and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rampd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are valued in inventorystockbased compensation  stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgmentdetermining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stockrecently adopted accounting standards see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  recently adopted accounting standards recently issued accounting standards see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  recently issued accounting standardsitem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate riskwe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio substantially all of our indebtedness is at fixed interest rates as a result the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates we estimate that as of september 3 2015 and august 28 2014 a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates of 1 would increase the fair value of our notes payable by approximately 366 million and 250 million respectively the increase in interest expense caused by a 1 increase in the interest rates of our variablerate debt would not be significantas of september 3 2015 and august 24 2014 we held debt securities of 383 billion and 165 billion respectively that were subject to interest rate risk we estimate that a 05 increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of these instruments by approximately 13 million as of september 3 2015 and 6 million as of august 28 2014foreign currency exchange rate riskthe information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in part i  item 1a risk factors changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 40the functional currency for all of our consolidated subsidiaries is the us dollar the substantial majority of our revenues are transacted in the us dollar however significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the british pound the euro the shekel the singapore dollar the new taiwan dollar the yen and the yuan we have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we utilize currency forward and option contracts in these hedging programs which reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposesto hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities we utilize a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities offset by balance sheet hedges we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 3 million as of september 3 2015 and 7 million as of august 28 2014 to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital

august 31 fiscal year 2015 contained 53 weeks and fiscal years 2014 and 2013 each contained 52 weeks all period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicatedderivative and hedging instruments  we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities or future cash flows and to reduce volatility in our earnings caused by changes in interest rates that affect our variablerate debt our derivatives have consisted of forward and option contracts and we have also entered into interest rate swap contracts we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes derivative instruments are measured at their fair values and recognized as either assets or liabilities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is based on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges for accounting purpose gains or losses from changes in fair values are recognized in other nonoperating income expense for derivative instruments designated as cashflow hedges the effective portion of the gain or loss is included as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective or excluded portion of the gain or loss is included in other nonoperating income expense the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss from these cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same line items of the consolidated statements of operation and in the same periods in which the underlying transactions affect earnings effectiveness is measured by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item for the effectiveness assessment of our cashflow hedges changes in the time value are excluded for forward contractswe enter into master netting arrangements with our counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative hedge transactions these master netting arrangements allow us and our counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other derivative

48inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value cost includes depreciation labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining net realizable value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting future average selling prices sales volumes and costs to complete products in work in process inventories when net realizable value is below cost we record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down inventories to their estimated net realizable value in advance of when the inventories are actually sold inventories are primarily categorized as memory including dram nonvolatile and other memory for purposes of determining the lower of average cost or net realizable value the major characteristics considered in determining inventory categories for purposes of determining the lower of cost or net realizable value are product type and markets we remove amounts from inventory and charge such amounts to cost of goods sold on an average cost basisproduct and process technology  costs incurred to 1 acquire product and process technology 2 patent technology and 3 maintain patent technology are capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over periods ranging up to 125 years we capitalize a portion of the costs incurred to patent technology based on historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents we file capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of 1 the estimated useful life of the technology 2 the patent term or 3 the term of the technology agreement fullyamortized assets are removed from product and process technology and accumulated amortizationproduct warranty  we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery under our general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions our warranty obligations are not significantproperty plant and equipment  property plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straightline method over estimated useful lives of generally 10 to 30 years for buildings 5 to 7 years for equipment and 3 to 5 years for software assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value and are included in other noncurrent assets when property plant or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed the net book value is removed and we recognize any gain or loss in our results of operationswe capitalize interest on borrowings during the period of time over which we carry out the activities necessary to bring the asset to the condition of its intended use and location capitalized interest becomes part of the cost of the underlying assets and amortized over the useful lives of the assetsresearch and development  costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment development of a product is deemed complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and has passed tests for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are valued in inventory product design and other research and development costs for certain technologies are shared with our joint venture partners amounts receivable from costsharing arrangements are reflected as a reduction of research and development expense see equity  noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries  imft noterevenue recognition  we recognize product or license revenue when persuasive evidence that a sales arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured if we are unable to reasonably estimate returns or the price

compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognized as expense under the straightline attribution method over the requisite service period we issue new shares upon the exercise of stock options or conversion of share units see equity plans notetreasury stock  when we retire our treasury stock any excess of the repurchase price paid over par value is allocated between additional capital and retained earnings use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may differ under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis actual results could differ from estimates 49variable interest entitieswe have interests in entities that are vies if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we are required to consolidate it to determine if we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process

significant assumptions and judgmentsunconsolidated viesinotera  inotera is a vie because of the terms of its supply agreement with us we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities of inotera that most significantly impact its economic performance primarily due to limitations on our governance rights that require the consent of other parties for key operating decisions and due to inoteras dependence on nanya for financing and the ability of inotera to operate in taiwan therefore we do not consolidate inotera and we account for our interest under the equity

consortium of financial institutions neither we nor the financing entities have an equity interest in equvo equvo is a vie because its equity is not sufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional support from the financing entities and because the thirdparty equity holder lacks characteristics of a controlling financial interest by design the arrangement with equvo is merely a financing vehicle and we do not bear any significant risks from variable interests with equvo therefore we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities of equvo that most significantly impact its economic performance and we do not consolidate equvosc hiroshima energy corporation  sc hiroshima energy corporation sche is an entity created to construct and operate a

inventory which changed the subsequent measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost or net realizable value with net realizable value defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation no other changes were made to the current guidance on inventory measurement we adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2015 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability as appropriate consistent with debt discounts as opposed to an asset we adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a retrospective basis as a result of adopting this standard we presented our debt issuance costs for recognized debt liabilities as a direct reduction of the related debt liability in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented see debt  retrospective application of a new accounting standard noterecently issued accounting standardsin april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201505  customers accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement which provides additional guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license under asu 201505 if a software cloud computing arrangement contains a software license customers should account for the license element of the arrangement in a manner consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses if the arrangement does not contain a software license customers should account for the arrangement as a service contract asu 201505 also removes the requirement to analogize to asc 84010  leases to determine the asset acquired in a

customers which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the us the core principal of this asu is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this asu also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract including the oneyear extension of this asu provided by asu 201514 we are required to adopt this asu beginning in our first quarter of 2019 however we are permitted to adopt this asu as early as our first quarter of 2018 this asu allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption we are

elpida now known as mmj and a controlling interest in rexchip now known as mmt for an aggregate of 949 million in cash collectively the mmj acquisition the mmj acquisition included 1 the acquisition of mmj including its 65 interest in mmt and 2 the acquisition of an additional 24 interest in mmt from powerchip technology corporation the mmt share purchase the mmj acquisition was treated as a single business combination because 1 the two transactions were entered into and closed contemporaneously and 2 the mmt share purchase was negotiated in contemplation of the acquisition of mmj and its completion was contingent on the closing of the acquisition of mmjin 2014 we purchased additional interests in mmt increasing our ownership interest to 995 see equity  noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries  mmt note the mmj acquisition included a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in hiroshima japan a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in taichung city taiwan and an assembly and test facility located in akita japan the operations from the mmj acquisition which are included primarily in our mbu and cnbu segments include the manufacture of mobile dram targeted to mobile phones and tablets and computing dram targeted to desktop pcs servers notebooks and workstationswe estimated the provisional fair values of the assets and liabilities of the mmj group as of the july 31 2013 acquisition date using an inuse model which reflects its value through its use in combination with other assets as a group and we recognized a gain in 2013 of 148 billion in the second quarter of 2014 the provisional amounts recorded in connection with the mmj acquisition were adjusted primarily for prepetition liabilities and we recognized a charge in 2014 for these measurement

the mmj groups operations after the july 31 2013 acquisition date selling general and administrative expenses in our results of operations for 2013 included transaction costs of 50 million incurred in connection with the mmj acquisition 52the acquisition of mmj was pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement on support for reorganization companies as amended the sponsor agreement that we entered into in july 2012 with the trustees of the mmj companies pursuant to and in connection with the mmj companies corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan as a result of the japan proceedings for so long as such proceedings are continuing the mmj companies are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies installment payments these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinarycourse advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside the ordinary course of business and may require consent of mmjs trustees or in certain cases approval by the japan court as a result the assets of the mmj companies while available to satisfy the mmj companies installment payments and other obligations capital expenditures and other operating needs of the mmj companies are not available for use by us in our other operations certain uses of the assets of the mmj companies including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt may require consent of mmjs trustees or in certain cases approval by the japan court disposition of

as a result of the issuance our ownership interest decreased from 40 to 35 and we recognized a nonoperating gain of 48 million in 2013 in 2014 inotera issued 400 million common shares in a public

cumulative translation adjustments from our equity investment in inoterasince january 2013 we have purchased all of inoteras dram output at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement in the second quarter of 2015 we executed a supply agreement to be effective beginning on january 1 2016 the 2016 supply agreement which will replace the current agreement under the 2016 supply agreement the price for dram products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us the 2016 supply agreement has an initial twoyear term followed by a threeyear winddown period and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a twoyear extension and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive oneyear extensions upon termination of the initial twoyear term of the 2016 supply agreement or any extensions we would purchase dram from inotera during the winddown period our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period in 2015 and 2014 our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities we purchased 237 billion 268 billion and 126 billion of dram products in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectivelytera probein 2013 as part of the mmj acquisition we acquired a 40 interest in tera probe which provides semiconductor wafer testing and probe services to us and others the initial net carrying value of our investment was less than our proportionate share of tera probes equity and the difference is being amortized as a credit to our earnings through equity in net income loss of equity method investees the tera probe amortization as of september 3 2015 the remaining balance of the tera probe amortization was 27 million and is expected to be amortized over a weightedaverage period of seven years based on closing trading prices the market value of our equity interest in tera probe was 32 million as of september 3 2015 and 41 million as of june 30 2015 the otherthantemporary impairment measurement date for our fourth quarter commensurate with our lag period we evaluated our investment in tera probe and concluded that the decline in the market value did not indicate an otherthantemporary impairment primarily because of the limited amount of time of the decline and historical volatility of tera probes stock price in the first quarter of 2015 we recorded an impairment charge of 10 million within equity in net income of equity method investees to write down the carrying value of our investment in tera probe to its fair value based on its trading price level 1 fair value measurement we incurred manufacturing costs for 2015 2014 and

corporation acquired aptina for approximately 433 million and we recognized a nonoperating gain of 119 million based on our diluted ownership interest of approximately 27 the gain approximated our share of the consideration because the carrying value of our investment had been reduced to zero in 2012 at which time we ceased recognizing our proportionate share of aptinas lossesthrough may 3 2013 we manufactured components for complementary metaloxide semiconductor cmos image sensors for aptina under a wafer supply agreement subsequent to may 3 2013 we provided various services for aptina

conversion require the debt and equity components to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects a nonconvertible borrowing rate when interest expense is recognized in subsequent periods the amount initially recorded as debt is based on the fair value of the debt component as a standalone instrument determined using an interest rate for similar nonconvertible debt issued by entities with credit ratings similar to ours at the time of issuance the difference between the debt recorded at inception and its principal amount is accreted to principal through interest expense over the estimated life of the note 64as of september 3 2015 the trading price of our common stock was higher than the initial conversion prices of our 2032 notes and our 2033 notes as a result the conversion

effective tax rate the increase in unrecognized tax benefits in 2015 primarily related to transfer pricing and other matters which were substantially offset by changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters within income tax expense as of september 3 2015 august 28 2014 and august 29 2013 the amount accrued for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions was 16 million 19 million and 16 million respectively the resolution of tax audits or lapses of statute of limitations could also reduce our unrecognized tax benefits although the timing of final resolution is uncertain the estimated potential reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months ranges from 0 to 67 million including interest and penaltieswe and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with the us federal government various us states and various foreign jurisdictions throughout the world our us federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2011 through 2015 in addition tax returns open to examination in multiple foreign taxing jurisdictions range from the years 2007 to 2015 we believe that adequate amounts of taxes and related interest and penalties have been provided for and any adjustments as a result of examinations are not expected to materially adversely affect our business

segmentscertain of the raw materials and production equipment we use in manufacturing semiconductor products are available from multiple sources and in sufficient supply however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and production equipment that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplierfinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash money market accounts certificates of deposit fixedrate debt securities trade receivables and derivative contracts we invest through highcreditquality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor a concentration of credit risk may exist with respect to receivables as a substantial portion of our customers are affiliated with the computing industry we perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers worldwide and generally do not require collateral from our customers historically we have not experienced significant losses on receivables a concentration of risk may also exist with respect to derivatives as the number of counterparties to our currency hedges is limited and the notional amounts are relatively large we seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and through entering into master netting arrangements capped calls expose us to credit risk to the extent the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements we seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across several major financial institutions in addition the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis 87geographic informationgeographic net sales based on customer shipto location were as followsfor the year ended
