entity that provides semiconductor wafer testing and probe services to us and others 4manufacturingour manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china japan malaysia singapore and taiwan our inotera joint venture has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment dram nand flash and nor flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines in 2015 we began construction of a significant expansion of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore for production of nand flash memoryour process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment we continuously enhance our production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in 2015 the majority of our dram production was manufactured on our 25nm linewidth process technologies we expect that by the second half of 2016 the majority of our dram production will be manufactured on our 20nm linewidth process technology in 2015 a majority of our nand flash production was manufactured on our 20nm and 16nm linewidth process technology we began production of 3d nand flash products in 2015 and expect that in 2016 the majority of our nand flash production will be manufactured using 16nm linewidth process technology or 3d nand technologywafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionalitywe test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process perform high temperature burnin on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and costwe sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie bare die forms our packaged products include memory modules ssds mcps managed nand memory cards usb devices and hmcs we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment we contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing companies to manufacture nand flash media products such as memory cards and usb devicesin recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 5availability of raw materialsour operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability and increase the cost of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we andor our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedmarketing and customersour products are sold into compute and graphics mobile ssd and other storage automotive industrial medical and other embedded and server markets market concentrations from 2015 net sales were approximately as follows 25 for compute and graphics including desktop pcs notebooks and workstations 25 for mobile 20 for ssd and other storage 15 for server and 10 for automotive industrial medical and other embedded sales to kingston primarily dram were 11 of our net sales in 2015 and 10 of our net sales in 2014 sales to intel primarily nand flash products through imft were 8 of our net sales in 2015 8 of our net sales in 2014 and 10 of our net sales in 2013 sales to hp primarily dram were 7 of our net sales in 2015 9 of our net sales in 2014 and 10 of our net sales in 2013our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron lexar crucial spectek and elpida brand names and private labels we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world we sell lexarbranded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several monthsbacklogbecause of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding periodproduct warrantybecause the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery under our general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions 6competitionwe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation sk hynix inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices many of our highvolume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors for these highvolume memory products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factors for our other memory products the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence over pricingresearch and developmentour process technology rampd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies as well as new fundamentally different memory structures materials and packages which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rampd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram and lpdram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including 3d nand and mlc and tlc technologies 3d xpoint memory nor flash memory specialty memory ssds hmcs and other memory technologies and systemsour rampd expenses were 154 billion 137 billion and 931 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand flash memory and 3d xpoint memory our rampd expenses reflect net reductions of 231 million 162 million and 176 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of reimbursements under our intel and other costsharing arrangementsto compete in the semiconductor memory industry we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions our process design and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world with our largest rampd center located in boise idaho and other significant rampd centers in japan china and other sites in the us in addition we develop photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boiserampd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rampd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualificationgeographic informationsales to customers outside the united states totaled 1363 billion for 2015 and included sales of 666 billion in china 224 billion in taiwan 125 billion in europe 103 billion in japan and

elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of uswe have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our businessif average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in previous years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future in some prior periods average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future  dram trade nand flash       percentage change in average selling

gross marginsour gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs including but not limited to process linewidth architecture number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and yield in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes difficulty in transitioning to smaller linewidth process technologies technological barriers and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory productsthe semiconductor memory industry is highly competitivewe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation sk hynix inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments such as china have provided and may continue to provide significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs transitions to smaller linewidth process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply in recent periods we and some of our competitors have begun construction on or announced plans to build new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 11debt obligations could adversely affect our financial conditionin recent periods our debt levels have increased due to the capital intensive nature of our business business acquisitions and restructuring of our capital structure as of september 3 2015 we had debt with a carrying value of 734 billion in addition the conversion value in excess of principal amount for our convertible notes outstanding as of september 3 2015 was 553 million in 2015 we paid 143 billion to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of 489 million in 2014 we paid 230 billion to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of 109 billion as of september 3 2015 we had 1 revolving credit facilities available that provide for up to 842 million of additional financing and 2 a term loan agreement available to obtain financing collateralized by certain property plant and equipment in the amount of 690 billion new taiwan dollars or an equivalent amount in us dollars approximately 213 million as of september 3 2015 of which we drew 40 million in 2015 the availability of these revolving and other facilities is subject to certain conditions including outstanding balances of trade receivables inventories collateralization of certain property plant and equipment and other conditions events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy these applicable drawdown conditions and utilize these facilities we have in the past and expect in the future to continue to incur additional debt to finance our capital investments business acquisitions and restructuring of our capital structureour debt obligations could adversely impact us for example these obligations couldrequire us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions rampd expenditures and other business activitiescontinue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notesrequire us to continue to pay cash amounts substantially in excess of the principal amounts upon settlement of our convertible notes to minimize dilution of our earnings per share limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures strategic acquisitions or business opportunities rampd and other general corporate requirementsadversely impact our credit rating which could increase future borrowing costs andincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditionsour ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future this to some extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditionwe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investmentsour cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rampd and product and process technology we estimate that cash expenditures in 2016 for property plant and equipment will be approximately 53 billion to 58 billion investments in capital expenditures for 2015 were 412 billion in addition as a result of the mmj acquisition and our capacity expansion in singapore we expect our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels as of september 3 2015 we had cash and marketable investments of 563 billion which included 748 million held by the mmj group and 134 million held by imft none of which is generally available to finance our other operations 12as a result of the japan proceedings for so long as such proceedings are continuing the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies installment payments these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the mmj companies as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court as a result the assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries while available to satisfy the mmj companies installment payments and the other obligations capital expenditures and other operating needs of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are not available for use by us in our other operations furthermore certain uses of the assets of the mmj group including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt may require consent of mmjs trustees andor the japan courtin the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our debt levels expected debt amortization and general economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditionsthe acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimondaon january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimonda insolvency proceedings filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor bv our netherlands subsidiary micron bv in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron bv and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron bv purchased substantially all of qimondas shares of inotera memories inc the inotera shares representing approximately 55 of our total shares in inotera as of september 3 2015 and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks among other things to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent crosslicense between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreementfollowing a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate on march 13 2014 the court issued judgments 1 ordering micron bv to pay approximately 1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase 2 ordering micron bv to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties 3 ordering micron bv to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares including in particular any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits 4 denying qimondas claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera and 5 determining that qimondas obligations under the patent crosslicense agreement are canceled in addition the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering among other things 1 that micron bv transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by it and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties and 2 that micron bv pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares the interlocutory judgments have no immediate enforceable effect on us and accordingly we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case we have filed a notice of appeal and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court the next hearing on the matter has not yet been scheduledwe are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron bv from the ownership of the inotera shares andor the termination of the patent crosslicense which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as of september 3 2015 the inotera shares had a carrying value for purposes of our financial reporting of 683 million and a market value of 846 million 13our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologiesour key semiconductor memory technologies of dram nand flash and nor flash face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability to meet these requirements we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance andor cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies  there can be no assurance of the followingthat we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory technologiesthat we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new productsthat we will be able to successfully market these technologies andthat margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development effortsin the fourth quarter of 2015 we announced the development of new 3d xpoint technology which is an entirely new class of nonvolatile memory there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market this new product technology will be successful if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affectednew product development may be unsuccessfulwe are developing new products including systemlevel memory products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop dram nand flash nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance of the followingthat our product development efforts will be successfulthat we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new productsthat we will be able to successfully market these products orthat margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development effortsif our efforts to develop new products are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affectedproducts that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on usproducts that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways including the followingwe may be required to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product or replace productswe could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages andwe may encounter adverse publicity which could cause a decrease in sales of our products 14a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionas is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see part ii financial information  item 8 financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements  contingencieswe have a number of intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable termsour joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous riskswe have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these relationships include our imft joint venture with intel our inotera joint venture with nanya and our mp mask joint venture with photronics these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the followingour interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities or on the amount timing or nature of further investments in our joint ventureour joint venture partners products may compete with our productswe may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventureswe may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint venturesour control over the operations of our joint ventures is limitedwe may recognize losses from our equity method investmentsdue to financial constraints our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with themdue to differing business models or longterm business goals our partners may decide not to join us in funding capital investment in our joint ventures which may result in higher levels of cash expenditures by uscash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirementswe may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partnersthe terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable andchanges in tax legal or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partnersif our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affectedif our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedwe manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the us singapore taiwan japan malaysia and china additionally our control over operations at imft inotera mp mask and tera probe is limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment equipment failures earthquakes or other environmental events if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships any of which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 15the operations of the mmj companies are subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedingsbecause the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj the japan proceedings are continuing and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the japan proceedings the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petitionduring the pendency of the japan proceedings the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively integrate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companiesour inotera supply agreements involves numerous riskssince january 2013 we have purchased all of inoteras dram output at a price reflecting a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement in the second quarter of 2015 we executed a supply agreement to be effective beginning on january 1 2016 the 2016 supply agreement which will replace the current agreement under the 2016 supply agreement the price for dram products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us the 2016 supply agreement has an initial twoyear term followed by a threeyear winddown period and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a twoyear extension and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive oneyear extensions upon termination of the initial twoyear term of the 2016 supply agreement or any extensions we would purchase dram from inotera during the winddown period our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period our inotera supply agreements involve numerous risks including the followinghigher costs for supply obtained under the inotera supply agreements as compared to our whollyowned facilitiesdifficulties and delays in ramping production at inoteradifficulties in transferring technology to inotera anddifficulties in coming to an agreement with nanya regarding major corporate decisions such as capital expenditures or capital structurein 2015 and in 2014 our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to the pricing formula of the current agreement and strong market conditions for 2015 we purchased 237 billion of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 35 of our aggregate dram gigabit production if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 16changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionacross our global operations there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the british pound euro shekel singapore dollar new taiwan dollar yen and yuan we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 27 million for 2015 28 million for 2014 and 229 million for 2013 based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities offset by balance sheet hedges we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 3 million as of september 3 2015 in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies exchange rates for some of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the yen have been volatile in recent periods if these currencies strengthen against the us dollar our manufacturing costs could significantly increase in the event that exchange rates for the us dollar adversely change against our foreign currency exposures our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affectedwe may make future acquisitions andor alliances which involve numerous risksacquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the followingintegrating the operations technologies and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operationsincreasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilitiesincreased debt levelsthe assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilitiesthe use of cash to finance a transaction which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital capital expenditures rampd expenditures and other business activitiesdiverting managements attention from daily operationsmanaging larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas hiring and retaining key employeesrequirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction which may include among other things divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired businessinability to realize synergies or other expected benefitsfailure to maintain customer vendor and other relationshipsinadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired companys internal financial controls disclosure controls and procedures andor environmental health and safety anticorruption human resource or other policies or practices andimpairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions technological advancements or worsethanexpected performance of the acquired businessin previous years supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram nand flash and nor flash products resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants including the liquidation of qimonda and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida now known as mmj these types of proceedings often lead to courtdirected processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionbreaches of our network security could expose us to losseswe manage and store on our network systems various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations we also process store and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees including sensitive personal information unauthorized users may be able to gain access to our network system and steal proprietary information compromise confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and could expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers suppliers or employees is compromised 17compliance with regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our productsincreased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act and its implementing securities and exchange commission regulations the doddfrank act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo the drc and finance or benefit local armed groups these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict freewe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposurewe operate in a number of locations outside the us including in singapore and to a lesser extent taiwan where we have tax incentive agreements that are in part conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the distribution of our earnings among these different jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including challenges by tax authorities to our tax structure income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements and changes in tax laws and regulations we file income tax returns with the us federal government various us states and various other jurisdictions throughout the world our us federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2011 through 2015 in addition tax returns open to examination in multiple other taxing jurisdictions range from the years 2007 to 2015 the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilitywe may not utilize all of our net deferred tax assetswe have substantial deferred tax assets which include among others net operating loss and credit carryforwards as of september 3 2015 our us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards including uncertain tax benefits were 402 billion and 205 billion respectively which if not utilized will expire at various dates from 2016 through 2035 as of september 3 2015 our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were 515 billion including 381 billion pertaining to japan which if not utilized substantially all will expire at various dates from 2017 through 2025 as of september 3 2015 we had valuation allowances of 116 billion and 710 million against our net deferred tax assets in the us and japan respectivelythe limited availability of raw materials supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionour operations require raw materials and in certain cases third party services that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as silicon wafers controllers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we andor our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials or services is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 18our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the suppliers limited capacity our inability to obtain this equipment timely could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp if we are unable to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affecteda downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our businessdownturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers mobile devices solidstate drives and servers reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedour results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster fire explosion or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionwe face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionsales to customers outside the united states approximated 84 of our consolidated net sales for 2015 in addition a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the

international operationsthese factors may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 19we are subject to counterparty default risks we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash deposits investments cappedcall contracts on our stock and derivative instruments as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which
