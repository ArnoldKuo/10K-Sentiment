termination of the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made although such early terminations are customarily granted there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition in these particular casesduring the pendency of the japan proceedings the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling material disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers
