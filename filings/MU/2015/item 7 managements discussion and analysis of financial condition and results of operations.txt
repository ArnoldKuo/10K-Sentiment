outpaced declines in average selling pricessince january 2013 we have purchased all of inoteras dram output at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement in the second quarter of 2015 we executed a supply agreement to be effective beginning on january 1 2016 the 2016 supply agreement which will replace the current agreement under the 2016 supply agreement the price for dram products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us the 2016 supply agreement has an initial twoyear term followed by a threeyear winddown period and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a twoyear extension and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive oneyear extensions upon termination of the initial twoyear term of the 2016 supply agreement or any extensions we would purchase dram from inotera during the winddown period our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period in 2015 and 2014 our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to the pricing formula of the current agreement and strong market conditions under the market conditions prevailing in the fourth quarter of 2015 costs of products purchased under the current agreement were higher than they would have been under the pricing formula of the 2016 supply agreement we purchased 237 billion 268 billion and 126 billion of dram products from inotera in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectivelyour overall gross margin percentage improved to 33 for 2014 from 20 for 2013 primarily due to improvements in the gross margin percentage for cnbu and mbu as a result of higher margins for dram products the gross margin improvements for cnbu and mbu for 2014 as compared to 2013 resulted primarily from the mmj acquisition manufacturing cost reductions and higher average selling prices for cnbu our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to reductions in costs and increases in average selling prices cost reductions for 2014 primarily reflected improvements in product and process technologies and the comparatively lower manufacturing costs of the mmj group partially offset by higher costs for product obtained under the inotera supply agreement for 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013 our costs of goods sold for dram products included the sale of the mmj groups inventories recorded at fair value in the mmj acquisition which was higher than the manufacturing cost of such inventories this increased our costs of goods sold by approximately 153 million for 2014 and 41 million for 2013 28operating results by business

as compared to 2014 was primarily due to increases in gigabit production despite our continued preparation of fabrication facilities for production of the next technology node which constrained output dram gigabit production growth in 2015 was also impacted by a shift to a higher mix of mobile and ddr4 products which have larger die sizes and therefore produce fewer bits per wafer the increase in gigabit sales of dram products for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher production volumes resulting from the mmj acquisition increased supply under the inotera supply agreement and improved product and process technologies partially offset by the transition of one of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore from dram to nand flash in 2014 dram products produced by facilities acquired in the mmj acquisition constituted 54 of our aggregate dram gigabit production as compared to 9 in 2013in 2015 and 2014 our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to the pricing formula of the current agreement and strong market conditions under the market conditions prevailing in the fourth quarter of 2015 costs of products purchased under the current agreement were higher than they would have been under the pricing formula of the 2016 supply agreement

primarily due to higher production from improved product and process technologies and the transition of our wafer fabrication facility in singapore from dram to nand flash production increases in gigabit production of nand flash products for 2015 as compared to 2014 were limited by a shift in product mix to higher levels of managed nand flash and mcp products which have both higher average selling prices and costs per gigabit increases in nand flash gigabits sold to trade customers for 2014 as compared to 2013 were primarily due to the transition of our wafer fabrication facility in

wafers processed an increase in depreciation expense due to rampd capital expenditures higher payroll costs higher subcontracted engineering and other professional service costs and an additional week in 2015 increases in rampd expenses for 2015 as compared to 2014 were partly attributable to increased spending on controllers firmware and engineering to support system level products including ssd managed nand flash and hmc products rampd expenses for 2014 increased 47 from 2013 primarily due to the incremental costs resulting from the mmj acquisition higher payroll costs resulting primarily from the reinstatement of variable pay plans and increased resources dedicated to development efforts we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand flash memory and 3d xpoint memory our rampd expenses reflect net reductions of 231 million 162 million and 176 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of reimbursements under our

statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statementsequity plansother operating income expense netother nonoperating income expense netliquidity and capital resourcesour primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets we generated cash from operations of 521 billion in 2015 and 570 billion in 2014 cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products which can vary significantly from period to period we obtained 250 billion from debt and lease financing in 2015 and 223 billion in 2014 as of september 3 2015 we had 1 revolving credit facilities available that provide for up to 842 million of additional financing based on eligible receivables and inventories and 2 a term loan agreement available to obtain financing collateralized by certain property plant and equipment in the amount of 690 billion new taiwan dollars or an equivalent amount in us dollars approximately 213 million as of september 3 2015 of which we drew 40 million on june 18 2015 we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures dilutionmanagement activities including repurchases of convertible notes and our common stock and ongoing operations we expect from time to time in the future to engage in a variety of transactions for such purposes including the issuance or incurrence of secured and unsecured debt and the refinancing and restructuring of existing debtto develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and equipment and rampd as a result of the mmj acquisition and our expansion in singapore we expect our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels we estimate that cash expenditures in 2016 for property plant and equipment will be approximately 53 billion to 58 billion which includes amounts we expect to be funded by our partners the actual amounts for 2016 will vary depending on market conditions investments in capital expenditures for 2015 were 412 billion total additions to property plant and equipment were 446 billion which in comparison to cash expenditures reflects differences in timing of receipts and payments for equipment as well as noncash additions such as equipment leases as of september 3 2015 we had commitments of approximately 162 billion for the acquisition of property plant and equipment substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year 34in december 2014 we announced plans to add approximately 255000 square feet of clean room space to our fabrication facility in singapore this expansion facilitates efficient implementation of 3d nand flash production at the singapore facility and gives us the flexibility to gradually add incremental capacity in response to market requirements construction of the additional space began in 2015 with initial manufacturing output likely in 2017 subject to market conditions we estimate capital expenditures of approximately 193 billion in 2016 related to this facilitysince the first quarter of 2015 our board of directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to 125 billion of our outstanding common stock 250 million of which was authorized in the first quarter of 2016 any repurchases under the authorization may be made in open market purchases block trades privatelynegotiated transactions andor derivative transactions repurchases are subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash during 2015 we repurchased 42 million shares for 831 million including commissions in the

convertible debt could impact the amount and timing of our cash payments2 amounts include principal and interest3 amounts include contractually obligated minimum lease payments for operating leases having an initial noncancelable term in excess of one year4 amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other longterm liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet including 222 million for the current portion of these longterm liabilities we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities therefore 91 million in aggregate of longterm income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities has been excluded from the preceding table however other noncurrent liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet included these uncertain tax positions and noncurrent deferred tax liabilitiesthe expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services market prices changes to agreedupon amounts or timing of certain events for some obligations the contractual obligations in the table above include the current portions of the related longterm obligations all other current liabilities are excludedpurchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria 1 they are noncancelable 2 we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled or 3 we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services takeorpay if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable the entire value of the contract was included in the above table if the obligation is cancelable but we would incur a penalty if canceled the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation contracted minimum amounts specified in takeorpay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment 37inotera supply agreements  since january 2013 we have purchased all of inoteras dram output at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement in the second quarter of 2015 we executed the 2016 supply agreement to be effective beginning on january 1 2016 which will replace the current agreement under the 2016 supply agreement the price for dram products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us the 2016 supply agreement has an initial twoyear term followed by a threeyear winddown period and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a twoyear extension and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive oneyear extensions upon termination of the initial twoyear term of the 2016 supply agreement or any extensions we would purchase dram from inotera during the winddown period our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period we purchased 237 billion of dram products from inotera in 2015 under the current agreement the current agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity as quantities are based on qualified production output and pricing fluctuates as it is based on market prices therefore we did not include any amounts under the current agreement in the contractual obligations table above under the 2016 supply agreement payments are primarily based on fluctuating quantities and prices but a portion of the expected costs under the agreement meet the criteria of a minimum lease payment under an operating lease and are included in the table above offbalance sheet arrangementswe have entered into capped calls which are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution from our convertible notes the capped calls provide for our receipt of cash or shares at our election from our counterparties if the trading price of our stock is above a specified initial strike price at the expiration dates the amounts receivable varies based on the trading price of our stock up to specified cap prices the dollar value of the cash or shares that we would receive from the capped calls on their expiration dates ranges from 0 if the trading price of our stock is below the initial strike price for all of the capped calls to 814 million if the trading price of our stock is at or above the cap price for all of the capped calls we paid 57 million in 2011 103 million in 2012 and 48 million in 2013 to purchase capped calls the amounts paid were recorded as charges to additional capital for further details of our capped call arrangements see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  equity  micron shareholders equity  capped callscritical accounting estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgmentsbusiness acquisitions accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values the items involving the most significant assumptions estimates and judgments included determining the fair value of the followingproperty plant and equipment including determination of values in a continueduse modeldeferred tax assets including projections of future taxable income and tax ratesinventory including estimated future selling prices timing of product sales and completion costs for work in process debt including discount rate and timing of payments andintangible assets including valuation methodology estimations of future revenue and costs profit allocation rates attributable to the acquired technology and discount rates 38consolidations we have interests in joint venture entities that are vies determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing whether an entity is a vie and if we are the entitys primary beneficiary to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies requires significant assumptions and judgmentcontingencies we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date in accounting for the resolution of contingencies considerable judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periodsincome taxes we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in recent periods our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and taiwan our income tax provision or benefit is dependent in part on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve numerous judgments including among others projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes manufacturing and overhead costs levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realizedinventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value cost includes depreciation labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining net realizable value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting future average selling prices sales volumes and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated net realizable value below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our memory inventory by approximately 195 million as of september 3 2015 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantlyus gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories inventories are primarily categorized as memory including dram nonvolatile and other memory for purposes of determining lower of average cost or net realizable value the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and marketsproperty plant and equipment we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 39research and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rampd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are valued in inventorystockbased compensation  stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgmentdetermining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stockrecently adopted accounting standards see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated
