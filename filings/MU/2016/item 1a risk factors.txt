probe services to us and others 5manufacturingour manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china japan malaysia singapore and taiwan inotera has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is generally replaced every five to seven years with increasingly advanced equipment dram nand flash 3d xpoint memory and nor flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines in 2015 we began construction of a significant expansion of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore for production of nand flash memory and we began utilizing a portion of the facility for production in the second half of 2016our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment we continuously enhance our production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in the second half of 2016 the majority of our dram production was manufactured on our 20nm linewidth process technologies we expect to ramp volume production of 1xnm process node dram in 2017 beginning in the first quarter of 2017 we expect a majority of our nand flash production to be manufactured using our first generation 3d nand technology in 2017 we expect to ramp our second generation 64layer 3d nand technology and we expect triplelevelcell to become the majority of our 3d nand outputwafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionalitywe test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process perform high temperature burnin on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost we use subcontractors to perform certain testing serviceswe sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie bare die forms our packaged products include memory modules ssds mcps managed nand memory cards usb devices and hmcs we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment we subcontract assembly services for the production of certain memory modules ssds mcps memory cards and usb devices in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 6availability of raw materials and use of service providersour operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability and increase the cost of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we and our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedour manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers contract manufacturers logistic carriers and other service providers we have made significant investments in supply chain risk monitoring and management to mitigate our risks associated with raw materials and service providersmarketing and customersmarket concentrations from 2016 net sales were approximately as follows 20 for compute and graphics including desktop pcs notebooks and workstations 20 for mobile 20 for ssd and other storage 15 for automotive industrial medical and other embedded and 10 for server sales to intel including nonvolatile memory through imft were 14 of our net sales in 2016 8 of our net sales in 2015 and 8 of our net sales in 2014 sales to kingston primarily dram were 7 of our net sales in 2016 11 of our net sales in 2015 and 10 of our net sales in 2014 our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron lexar crucial spectek and elpida brand names and private labels we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world we sell lexarbranded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several monthsbacklogbecause of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding periodproduct warrantybecause the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery under our standard terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions 7competitionwe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc toshiba corporation and western digital corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments such as china have provided and may continue to provide significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some of our competitors have plans to or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition many of our highvolume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors for these highvolume memory products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factors for our other memory products the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence over pricingresearch and developmentour process technology rampd efforts are focused primarily on development of process technologies that enable successively smaller linewidths additional 3d memory layers and additional bits per cell ie cell levels we are also focused on developing new fundamentally different memory structures materials and packages which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rampd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr4 and ddr5 dram and lpdram products as well as high density and mobile 3d nand flash memory including tlc and qlc technologies 3d xpoint memory ssds including firmware and controllers managed nand specialty memory nor flash memory and other memory technologies and systemsour rampd expenses were 162 billion 154 billion and 137 billion in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand flash memory and 3d xpoint memory our rampd expenses reflect net reductions of 208 million 231 million and 162 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively as a result of reimbursements under our costsharing arrangements with intel and othersto compete in the semiconductor memory industry we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions our process design and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world with our largest rampd center located in boise idaho and other significant rampd centers in japan china italy singapore and other sites in the us in 2016 we commenced construction on an expansion of our rampd facility in boiserampd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rampd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 8geographic informationsales to customers outside the united states totaled 1047

following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from past results and those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us the order of these factors is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each poses to us our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant the factors below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and stock pricewe have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our businessif average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in previous years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future in some prior periods average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future  dram trade nonvolatile       percentage change in average selling prices2016 from 2015 35 202015 from 2014 11 172014 from 2013 6  232013 from 2012 11 182012 from 2011 45 55we may be unable to maintain or improve gross marginsour gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs including but not limited to process linewidth additional 3d memory layers additional bits per cell ie cell levels architecture number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and yield in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes difficulties in transitioning to smaller linewidth process technologies technological barriers and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory productsthe semiconductor memory industry is highly competitivewe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc toshiba corporation and western digital corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments such as china have provided and may continue to provide significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some of our competitors have plans to or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have cost or performance advantages 13debt obligations could adversely affect our financial conditionin recent periods our debt levels have increased due to the capital intensive nature of our business business acquisitions and restructuring of our capital structure as of september 1 2016 we had debt with a carrying value of 991 billion in 2016 2015 and 2014 we paid 94 million 143 billion 230 billion respectively to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with principal amounts of and 57 million 489 million and 109 billion respectively as of september 1 2016 we had a revolving credit facility available for up to 488 million of additional financing the availability of this revolving facility is subject to certain conditions including outstanding balances of eligible receivables events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy these applicable drawdown conditions and utilize this facility we have incurred in the past and expect to incur in the future debt to finance our capital investments business acquisitions and restructuring of our capital structure in 2016 we issued 125 billion of our 2023 secured notes and 750 million of our 2022 term loan b and received an aggregate of 765 million in equipment saleleaseback financing transactions in connection with our proposed acquisition of the remaining interest in inotera we plan to fund a portion of the acquisition with a loan of up to 80 billion new taiwan dollars equivalent to 25 billion under the term loan facility and at our option 126 billion new taiwan dollars equivalent to 396 million of 2021 convertible notes the date for the closing of the inotera transaction has been set by the inotera board for december 6 2016 consummation of the inotera transaction remains subject to certain closing conditions and there can be no assurance that the inotera transaction will be consummatedour debt obligations could adversely impact us for example these obligations couldrequire us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions rampd expenditures and other business activitiesrequire us and our mstw subsidiary to comply with financial covenants which if mstw fails to maintain could result in all obligations owing under the term loan agreement being accelerated to be immediately due and payable and if we or mstw fail to maintain could result in an increase to the applicable interest rateadversely impact our credit rating which could increase future borrowing costslimit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures strategic acquisitions or business opportunities rampd and other general corporate requirementsrestrict microns ability and that of its domestic restricted subsidiaries to create or incur certain liens and enter into saleleaseback financing transactionsincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditionscontinue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notes andrequire us to continue to pay cash amounts substantially in excess of the principal amounts upon settlement of our convertible notes to minimize dilution of our earnings per shareour ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future this to some extent is subject to market economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditionwe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investmentsour cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rampd and product and process technology we estimate that net cash expenditures in 2017 for property plant and equipment will be approximately 48 billion to 52 billion which reflects the offset of amounts we expect to be funded by our partners investments in capital expenditures offset by amounts funded by our partners were 540 billion for 2016 as of september 1 2016 we had cash and marketable investments of 481 billion as of september 1 2016 919 million of cash and equivalents and shortterm investments including substantially all of the 896 million held by the mmj group were held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the us would subject these funds to us federal income taxes in addition cash held by imft of 98 million was generally not available to finance our other operations 14as a result of the japan proceedings for so long as such proceedings are continuing the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies installment payments these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the mmj companies as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court as a result the assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries while available to satisfy the mmj companies installment payments and the other obligations capital expenditures and other operating needs of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are not available for use by us in our other operations furthermore certain uses of the assets of the mmj group including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt may require consent of mmjs trustees andor the japan courtin the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our debt levels expected debt amortization and general economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditionsour proposed acquisition of the remaining shares of inotera involves numerous risksin the second quarter of 2016 we entered into agreements to acquire the remaining interest in inotera for 30 new taiwan dollars per share in cash equivalent to approximately 095 per share as of september 1 2016 we held a 33 ownership interest in inotera nanya and certain of its affiliates held a 32 ownership interest and the remaining ownership interest in inotera was publicly held based on the exchange rate as of september 1 2016 we estimate the aggregate consideration payable for the 67 of inotera shares not owned by us would be approximately 41 billion we anticipate financing the acquisition with a combination of the following80 billion new taiwan dollar equivalent to 25 billion fiveyear term loan facility at a variable rate equal to the threemonth or sixmonth taibor at our or inoteras option plus a margin of 205 per annum under the term loan facilityup to 315 billion new taiwan dollars equivalent to 991 million from the issuance of the micron shares under the private placement126 billion new taiwan dollars equivalent to 396 million from the issuance of the 2021 convertible notes in lieu of a corresponding amount of micron shares so long as we also issue micron shares to nanya of at least 63 billion new taiwan dollars equivalent to 198 million pursuant to the private placementadditional borrowings under our existing credit agreement andcash on handon march 29 2016 the transaction was approved by the shareholders of inotera including nanya and certain of nanyas affiliates which approval was provided pursuant to voting and support agreements on october 11 2016 the inotera board set the date for the closing of the transaction to be december 6 2016 consummation of the inotera transaction is subject to significant uncertainties certain termination rights and various conditions including regulatory approvals and the consummation of debt financing there can be no assurance that the various conditions will be satisfied or that the inotera transaction will ultimately be consummated if the remaining closing conditions are not satisfied or waived we will be unable to close the acquisition in addition to the acquisition risks described elsewhere the acquisition is expected to involve the following significant risks we may be unable to realize the anticipated financial benefits of the acquisitionincreased exposure to the dram market which experienced significant declines in pricing during 2015 and 2016our consolidated financial condition may be adversely impacted by the increased leverage resulting from the transactionhigher capital expenditures in future periods 15increased exposure to operating costs denominated in new taiwan dollarsintegration issues with inoteras manufacturing operations in taiwan andintegration of business systems and processesour proposed acquisition of the remaining shares of inotera is inherently risky may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition see part ii  item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  proposed acquisition of inoteraour future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologiesour key semiconductor memory technologies of dram and nand flash face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability to meet these requirements we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance and cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies  there can be no assurance of the followingthat we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory technologiesthat we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new productsthat we will be able to successfully market these technologies andthat margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development effortsin 2015 we announced the development of new 3d xpoint technology which is an entirely new class of nonvolatile memory there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market this new product technology will be successful if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affectednew product development may be unsuccessfulwe are developing new products including systemlevel memory products which complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop dram nand flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance of the followingthat our product development efforts will be successfulthat we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new productsthat we will be able to successfully market these productsthat we will be able to qualify new products with our customers on a timely basis orthat margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development effortsif our efforts to develop new products are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affectedproducts that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on usproducts that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways including the followingwe may be required to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product and to replace products 16we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages andwe may encounter adverse publicity which could cause a decrease in sales of our productsa determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionas is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see part ii  item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  contingencieswe have a number of intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make onetime or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable termsthe acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimondaon january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimonda insolvency proceedings filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor bv our netherlands subsidiary micron bv in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron bv and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron bv purchased substantially all of qimondas shares of inotera memories inc the inotera shares representing approximately 55 of our total shares in inotera as of september 1 2016 and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks among other things to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent crosslicense between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreementfollowing a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate on march 13 2014 the court issued judgments 1 ordering micron bv to pay approximately 1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase 2 ordering micron bv to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties 3 ordering micron bv to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares including in particular any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits 4 denying qimondas claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera and 5 determining that qimondas obligations under the patent crosslicense agreement are canceled in addition the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering among other things 1 that micron bv transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by it and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties and 2 that micron bv pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares the interlocutory judgments have no immediate enforceable effect on us and accordingly we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case we have filed a notice of appeal and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals courtwe are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron bv from the ownership of the inotera shares andor the termination of the patent crosslicense which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as of september 1 2016 the inotera shares had a carrying value for purposes of our financial reporting of 674 million and a market value of 996 million 17our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous riskswe have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these relationships include our imft joint venture with intel and our inotera joint venture with nanya these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the followingour interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities or on the amount timing or nature of further investments in our joint ventureour joint venture partners products may compete with our productswe may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventureswe may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint venturesour control over the operations of our joint ventures is limitedwe may recognize losses from our equity method investmentsdue to financial constraints our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with themdue to differing business models or longterm business goals we and our partners may not participate to the same extent on funding capital investments in our joint venturescash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirementswe may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partnersthe terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable andchanges in tax legal or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partnersif our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affectedif our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedwe manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the us singapore taiwan japan malaysia and china additionally our control over operations at imft inotera and tera probe is limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment equipment failures earthquakes or other environmental events if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships any of which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionwe may incur additional restructure charges in future periodsin the fourth quarter of 2016 we initiated a restructure plan in response to the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on our key priorities in which we expect to save as compared to our previously planned spending levels approximately 80 million per quarter in 2017 the savings are expected to result from a combination of a more focused set of projects and programs the permanent closure of a number of open headcount requisitions workforce reductions in certain areas of the business and other nonheadcount related spending reductions in connection with the plan we expect to incur charges of 80 million substantially all in cash expenditures of which 58 million was incurred in 2016 with the remainder in the early part of 2017we may not realize the expected quarterly cost savings we may also incur additional restructure charges or other losses associated with other initiatives in future periods in connection with those initiatives we could incur restructure charges loss of production output loss of key personnel disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products 18the operations of the mmj companies are subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedingsbecause the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj the japan proceedings are continuing and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the japan proceedings the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petitionduring the pendency of the japan proceedings the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively operate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companiesour inotera supply agreement involves numerous risksin 2016 we purchased 143 billion of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 30 of our aggregate dram gigabit production in 2015 and 2014 our cost for inotera products was higher than the cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to declines in average selling prices our per gigabit cost of products purchased from inotera decreased throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016 such that our cost for inotera products more closely approximated our cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities for the second and third quarters of 2016 due to improvements in average selling prices in late 2016 coupled with decreases in manufacturing costs of our whollyowned operations our cost for inotera products increased and were approximately 20 higher than our cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities for the fourth quarter of 2016 if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks including the followinghigher costs for supply obtained under the inotera supply agreement as compared to our whollyowned facilitiesdifficulties and delays in ramping production at inoteradifficulties in transferring technology to inotera anddifficulties in coming to an agreement with nanya regarding major corporate decisions such as capital expenditures or capital structure 19changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionacross our global operations certain transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the euro singapore dollar new taiwan dollar and yen we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 24 million for 2016 27 million for 2015 and 28 million for 2014 based on our foreign currency balances from monetary assets and liabilities we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 241 million as of september 1 2016 although we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies exchange rates for some of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the yen have been volatile in recent periods if these currencies strengthen against the us dollar our manufacturing costs could significantly increase in the event that exchange rates for the us dollar adversely change against our foreign currency exposures our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected in addition in connection with our proposed acquisition of inotera our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates could increase if not offset by corresponding hedgeswe may make future acquisitions andor alliances which involve numerous risksacquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the followingintegrating the operations technologies and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operationsincreasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain

other policies or practices andimpairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions technological advancements or worsethanexpected performance of the acquired businessin previous years supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram nand flash and nor flash products resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants including the liquidation of qimonda and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida now known as mmj these types of proceedings often lead to courtdirected processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 20breaches of our security systems could expose us to losseswe maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities we also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations in addition we process store and

significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and could expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers suppliers or employees is compromisedcompliance with regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our productsincreased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act and its implementing securities and exchange commission regulations the doddfrank act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo the drc and finance or benefit local armed groups these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict freewe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that may result in additional costs and liabilitiesthe manufacturing of our products requires the use of facilities equipment and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate additionally we are subject to a

challengeswe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposurewe operate in a number of locations outside the us including in singapore and to a lesser extent taiwan where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the distribution of our earnings among these different jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including challenges by tax authorities to our tax structure and intercompany transfer pricing agreements income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive

utilize our net operating loss carryforwardsif we experience a 50 or greater change in ownership involving shareholders owning 5 or more of our stock it could adversely impact our ability to utilize our existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards the inability to utilize existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards would significantly increase the amount of our annual cash taxes reducing the overall amount of cash available to be used in other areas of the businesson july 20 2016 our board of directors adopted a section 382 rights agreement the rights agreement under which our shareholders of record as of the close of business on august 1 2016 received one right for each share of common stock outstanding the rights agreement is intended to avoid an ownership change as defined by section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and thereby preserve our current ability to utilize certain net operating loss and credit carryforwards in general an ownership change will occur when the percentage of our ownership by one or more 5 shareholders has increased by more than 50 at any time during the prior three years pursuant to the rights agreement if a shareholder or group acquires beneficial ownership of 499 or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock without prior approval of our board of directors or without meeting certain customary exceptions the rights would become exercisable and entitle shareholders other than the acquiring shareholder or group to purchase additional shares of our common stock at a significant discount and result in significant dilution in the economic interest and voting power of acquiring shareholder or group although the rights agreement is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect us there is no assurance that the rights agreement will prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change the rights agreement is subject to shareholder approval at the companys fiscal 2016 annual meeting of shareholders if not approved by the shareholders the rights agreement will terminate on july 19 2017the limited availability of raw materials supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionour operations require raw materials and in certain cases third party services that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as silicon wafers controllers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we andor our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials or services is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedour operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the suppliers limited capacity our inability to obtain this equipment timely could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp if we are unable to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 22a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our businessdownturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers mobile devices ssds and servers reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic

with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding in the event of such default we could incur significant losses which could adversely impact our business results of operations or financial
