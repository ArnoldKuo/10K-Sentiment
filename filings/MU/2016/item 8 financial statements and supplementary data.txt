equity method investments  inotera and proposed acquisition of inotera3tera probe we have an approximate 40 ownership interest in tera probe an entity that provides semiconductor wafer testing and probe services to us and others 5manufacturingour manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china japan malaysia singapore and taiwan inotera has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is generally replaced every five to seven years with increasingly advanced equipment dram nand flash 3d xpoint memory and nor flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines in 2015 we began construction of a significant expansion of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore for production of nand flash memory and we began utilizing a portion of the facility for production in the second half of 2016our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment we continuously enhance our production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in the second half of 2016 the majority of our dram production was manufactured on our 20nm linewidth process technologies we expect to ramp volume production of 1xnm process node dram in 2017 beginning in the first quarter of 2017 we expect a majority of our nand flash production to be manufactured using our first generation 3d nand technology in 2017 we expect to ramp our second generation 64layer 3d nand technology and we expect triplelevelcell to become the majority of our 3d nand outputwafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionalitywe test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process perform high temperature burnin on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost we use subcontractors to perform certain testing serviceswe sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie bare die forms our packaged products include memory modules ssds mcps managed nand memory cards usb devices and hmcs we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment we subcontract assembly services for the production of certain memory modules ssds mcps memory cards and usb devices in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 6availability of raw materials and use of service providersour operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability and increase the cost of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we and our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedour manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers contract manufacturers logistic carriers and other service providers we have made significant investments in supply chain risk monitoring and management to mitigate our risks associated with raw materials and service providersmarketing and customersmarket concentrations from 2016 net sales were approximately as follows 20 for compute and graphics including desktop pcs notebooks and workstations 20 for mobile 20 for ssd and other storage 15 for automotive industrial medical and other embedded and 10 for server sales to intel including nonvolatile memory through imft were 14 of our net sales in 2016 8 of our net sales in 2015 and 8 of our net sales in 2014 sales to kingston primarily dram were 7 of our net sales in 2016 11 of our net sales in 2015 and 10 of our net sales in 2014 our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron lexar crucial spectek and elpida brand names and private labels we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world we sell lexarbranded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several monthsbacklogbecause of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding periodproduct warrantybecause the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery under our standard terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions 7competitionwe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc toshiba corporation and western digital corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments such as china have provided and may continue to provide significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some of our competitors have plans to or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition many of our highvolume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors for these highvolume memory products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factors for our other memory products the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence over pricingresearch and developmentour process technology rampd efforts are focused primarily on development of process technologies that enable successively smaller linewidths additional 3d memory layers and additional bits per cell ie cell levels we are also focused on developing new fundamentally different memory structures materials and packages which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rampd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr4 and ddr5 dram and lpdram products as well as high density and mobile 3d nand flash memory including tlc and qlc technologies 3d xpoint memory ssds including firmware and controllers managed nand specialty memory nor flash memory and other memory technologies and systemsour rampd expenses were 162 billion 154 billion and 137 billion in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand flash memory and 3d xpoint memory our rampd expenses reflect net reductions of 208 million 231 million and 162 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively as a result of reimbursements under our costsharing arrangements with intel and othersto compete in the semiconductor memory industry we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions our process design and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world with our largest rampd center located in boise idaho and other significant rampd centers in japan china italy singapore and other sites in the us in 2016 we commenced construction on an expansion of our rampd facility in boiserampd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rampd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 8geographic informationsales to customers outside the united states totaled 1047 billion for 2016 and included sales of 530 billion in china 152 billion in taiwan 937 million in europe 831 million in japan and 161 billion in the rest of the asia pacific region excluding china

costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory productsthe semiconductor memory industry is highly competitivewe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc toshiba corporation and western digital corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments such as china have provided and may continue to provide significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some of our competitors have plans to or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have cost or performance advantages 13debt obligations could adversely affect our financial conditionin recent periods our debt levels have increased due to the capital intensive nature of our business business acquisitions and restructuring of our capital structure as of september 1 2016 we had debt with a carrying value of 991 billion in 2016 2015 and 2014 we paid 94 million 143 billion 230 billion respectively to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with principal amounts of and 57 million 489 million and 109 billion respectively as of september 1 2016 we had a revolving credit facility available for up to 488 million of additional financing the availability of this revolving facility is subject to certain conditions including outstanding balances of eligible receivables events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy these applicable drawdown conditions and utilize this facility we have incurred in the past and expect to incur in the future debt to finance our capital investments business acquisitions and restructuring of our capital structure in 2016 we issued 125 billion of our 2023 secured notes and 750 million of our 2022 term loan b and received an aggregate of 765 million in equipment saleleaseback financing transactions in connection with our proposed acquisition of the remaining interest in inotera we plan to fund a portion of the acquisition with a loan of up to 80 billion new taiwan dollars equivalent to 25 billion under the term loan facility and at our option 126 billion new taiwan dollars equivalent to 396 million of 2021 convertible notes the date for the closing of the inotera transaction has been set by the inotera board for december 6 2016 consummation of the inotera transaction remains subject to certain closing conditions and there can be no assurance that the inotera transaction will be consummatedour debt obligations could adversely impact us for example these obligations couldrequire us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions rampd expenditures and other business activitiesrequire us and our mstw subsidiary to comply with financial covenants which if mstw fails to maintain could result in all obligations owing under the term loan agreement being accelerated to be immediately due and payable and if we or mstw fail to maintain could result in an increase to the applicable interest rateadversely impact our credit rating which could increase future borrowing costslimit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures strategic acquisitions or business opportunities rampd and other general corporate requirementsrestrict microns ability and that of its domestic restricted subsidiaries to create or incur certain liens and enter into saleleaseback financing transactionsincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditionscontinue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notes andrequire us to continue to pay cash amounts substantially in excess of the principal amounts upon settlement of our convertible notes to minimize dilution of our earnings per shareour ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future this to some extent is subject to market economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditionwe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investmentsour cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rampd and product and process technology we estimate that net cash expenditures in 2017 for property plant and equipment will be approximately 48 billion to 52 billion which reflects the offset of amounts we expect to be funded by our partners investments in capital expenditures offset by amounts funded by our partners were 540 billion for 2016 as of september 1 2016 we had cash and marketable investments of 481 billion as of september 1 2016 919 million of cash and equivalents and shortterm investments including substantially all of the 896 million held by the mmj group were held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the us would subject these funds to us federal income taxes in addition cash held by imft of 98 million was generally not available to finance our other operations 14as a result of the japan proceedings for so long as such proceedings are continuing the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies installment payments these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the mmj companies as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court as a result the assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries while available to satisfy the mmj companies installment payments and the other obligations capital expenditures and other operating needs of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are not available for use by us in our other operations furthermore certain uses of the assets of the mmj group including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt may require consent of mmjs trustees andor the japan courtin the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our debt levels expected debt amortization and general economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditionsour proposed acquisition of the remaining shares of inotera involves numerous risksin the second quarter of 2016 we entered into agreements to acquire the remaining interest in inotera for 30 new taiwan dollars per share in cash equivalent to approximately 095 per share as of september 1 2016 we held a 33 ownership interest in inotera nanya and certain of its affiliates held a 32 ownership interest and the remaining ownership interest in inotera was publicly held based on the exchange rate as of september 1 2016 we estimate the aggregate consideration payable for the 67 of inotera shares not owned by us would be approximately 41 billion we anticipate financing the acquisition with a combination of the following80 billion new taiwan dollar equivalent to 25 billion fiveyear term loan facility at a variable rate equal to the threemonth or sixmonth taibor at our or inoteras option plus a margin of 205 per annum under the term loan facilityup to 315 billion new taiwan dollars equivalent to 991 million from the issuance of the micron shares under the private placement126 billion new taiwan dollars equivalent to 396 million from the issuance of the 2021 convertible notes in lieu of a corresponding amount of micron shares so long as we also issue micron shares to nanya of at least 63 billion new taiwan dollars equivalent to 198 million pursuant to the private placementadditional borrowings under our existing credit agreement andcash on handon march 29 2016 the transaction was approved by the shareholders of inotera including nanya and certain of nanyas affiliates which approval was provided pursuant to voting and support agreements on october 11 2016 the inotera board set the date for the closing of the transaction to be december 6 2016 consummation of the inotera transaction is subject to significant uncertainties certain termination rights and various conditions including regulatory approvals and the consummation of debt financing there can be no assurance that the various conditions will be satisfied or that the inotera transaction will ultimately be consummated if the remaining closing conditions are not satisfied or waived we will be unable to close the acquisition in addition to the acquisition risks described elsewhere the acquisition is expected to involve the following significant risks we may be unable to realize the anticipated financial benefits of the acquisitionincreased exposure to the dram market which experienced significant declines in pricing during 2015 and 2016our consolidated financial condition may be adversely impacted by the increased leverage resulting from the transactionhigher capital expenditures in future periods 15increased exposure to operating costs denominated in new taiwan dollarsintegration issues with inoteras manufacturing operations in taiwan andintegration of business systems and processesour proposed acquisition of the remaining shares of inotera is inherently risky may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition see part ii  item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  proposed acquisition of inoteraour future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologiesour key semiconductor memory technologies of dram and nand flash face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability to meet these requirements we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance and cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies  there can be no assurance of the followingthat we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory technologiesthat we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new productsthat we will be able to successfully market these technologies andthat margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development effortsin 2015 we announced the development of new 3d xpoint technology which is an entirely new class of nonvolatile memory there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market this new product technology will be successful if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affectednew product development may be unsuccessfulwe are developing new products including systemlevel memory products which complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop dram nand flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins

customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways including the followingwe may be required to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product and to replace products 16we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages andwe may encounter adverse publicity which could cause a decrease in sales of our productsa determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionas is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see part ii  item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  contingencieswe have a number of intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make onetime or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable termsthe acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimondaon january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimonda insolvency proceedings filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor bv our netherlands subsidiary micron bv in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron bv and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron bv purchased substantially all of qimondas shares of inotera memories inc the inotera shares representing approximately 55 of our total shares in inotera as of september 1 2016 and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks among other things to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent crosslicense between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreementfollowing a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate on march 13 2014 the court issued judgments 1 ordering micron bv to pay approximately 1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase 2 ordering micron bv to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties 3 ordering micron bv to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares including in particular any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits 4 denying qimondas claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera and 5 determining that qimondas obligations under the patent crosslicense agreement are canceled in addition the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering among other things 1 that micron bv transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by it and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties and 2 that micron bv pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares the interlocutory judgments have no immediate enforceable effect on us and accordingly we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case we have filed a notice of appeal and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals courtwe are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron bv from the ownership of the inotera shares andor the termination of the patent crosslicense which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as of september 1 2016 the inotera shares had a carrying value for purposes of our financial reporting of 674 million and a market value of 996 million 17our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous riskswe have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these relationships include our imft joint venture with intel and our inotera joint venture with nanya these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the followingour interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities or on the amount timing or nature of further investments in our joint ventureour joint venture partners products may compete with our productswe may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventureswe may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint venturesour control over the operations of our joint ventures is limitedwe may recognize losses from our equity method investmentsdue to financial constraints our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with themdue to differing business models or longterm business goals we and our partners may not participate to the same extent on funding capital investments in our joint venturescash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirementswe may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partnersthe terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable andchanges in tax legal or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partnersif our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affectedif our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedwe manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the us singapore taiwan japan malaysia and china additionally our control over operations at imft inotera and tera probe is limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment equipment failures earthquakes or other environmental events if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships any of which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionwe may incur additional restructure charges in future periodsin the fourth quarter of 2016 we initiated a restructure plan in response to the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on our key priorities in which we expect to save as compared to our previously planned spending levels approximately 80 million per quarter in 2017 the savings are expected to result from a combination of a more focused set of projects and programs the permanent closure of a number of open headcount requisitions workforce reductions in certain areas of the business and other nonheadcount related spending reductions in connection with the plan we expect to incur charges of 80 million substantially all in cash expenditures of which 58 million was incurred in 2016 with the remainder in the early part of 2017we may not realize the expected quarterly cost savings we may also incur additional restructure charges or other losses associated with other initiatives in future periods in connection with those initiatives we could incur restructure charges loss of production output loss of key personnel disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products 18the operations of the mmj companies are subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedingsbecause the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj the japan proceedings are continuing and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the japan proceedings the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petitionduring the pendency of the japan proceedings the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively operate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companiesour inotera supply agreement involves numerous risksin 2016 we purchased 143 billion of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 30 of our aggregate dram gigabit production in 2015 and 2014 our cost for inotera products was higher than the cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to declines in average selling prices our per gigabit cost of products purchased from inotera decreased throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016 such that our cost for inotera products more closely approximated our cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities for the second and third quarters of 2016 due to improvements in average selling prices in late 2016 coupled with decreases in manufacturing costs of our whollyowned operations our cost for inotera products increased and were approximately 20 higher than our cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities for the fourth quarter of 2016 if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks including the followinghigher costs for supply obtained under the inotera supply agreement as compared to our whollyowned facilitiesdifficulties and delays in ramping production at inoteradifficulties in transferring technology to inotera anddifficulties in coming to an agreement with nanya regarding major corporate decisions such as capital expenditures or capital structure 19changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionacross our global operations certain transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the euro singapore dollar new taiwan dollar and yen we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 24 million for 2016 27 million for 2015 and 28 million for 2014 based on our foreign currency balances from monetary assets and liabilities we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 241 million as of september 1 2016 although we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies exchange rates for some of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the yen have been volatile in recent periods if these currencies strengthen against the us dollar our manufacturing costs could significantly increase in the event that exchange rates for the us dollar adversely change against our foreign currency exposures our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected in addition in connection with our proposed acquisition of inotera our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates could increase if not offset by corresponding hedgeswe may make future acquisitions andor alliances which involve numerous risksacquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the followingintegrating the operations technologies and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operationsincreasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilitiesincreased debt levelsthe assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilitiesthe use of cash to finance a transaction which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital capital expenditures rampd expenditures and other business activitiesdiverting managements attention from daily operationsmanaging larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas hiring and retaining key employeesrequirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction which may include among other things divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired businessinability to realize synergies or other expected benefitsfailure to maintain customer vendor and other relationshipsinadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired companys internal financial controls disclosure controls and procedures andor environmental health and safety anticorruption human resource or other policies or practices andimpairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions technological advancements or worsethanexpected performance of the acquired businessin previous years supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram nand flash and nor flash products resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants including the liquidation of qimonda and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida now known as mmj these types of proceedings often lead to courtdirected processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 20breaches of our security systems could expose us to losseswe maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities we also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations in addition we process store and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees including sensitive personal information unauthorized persons or employees may gain access to our facilities or network systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information compromise confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities breaches of our physical security and attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and could expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers suppliers or employees is compromisedcompliance with regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our productsincreased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act and its implementing securities and exchange commission regulations the doddfrank act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo the drc and finance or benefit local armed groups these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict freewe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that may result in additional costs and liabilitiesthe manufacturing of our products requires the use of facilities equipment and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate additionally we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction maintenance and operations of our facilities any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results additionally we partner with other companies in our joint ventures which are also subject to a broad array of laws and regulations our ownership in these joint ventures may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with these laws and regulations our failure or the failure of our joint ventures to comply with these laws and regulations could result insuspension of productionremediation costsalteration of our manufacturing processesregulatory penalties fines and legal liabilities andreputational challengeswe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposurewe operate in a number of locations outside the us including in singapore and to a lesser extent taiwan where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the distribution of our earnings among these different jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including challenges by tax authorities to our tax structure and intercompany transfer pricing agreements income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements and changes in tax laws and regulations we file income tax returns with the us federal government various us states and various other jurisdictions throughout the world our us federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2012 through 2016 in addition tax returns open to examination in singapore japan and taiwan range from the years 2011 to 2016 the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 21we may not utilize all of our net deferred tax assetswe have substantial deferred tax assets which include among others net operating loss and credit carryforwards as of september 1 2016 our us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards including uncertain tax benefits were 390 billion and 194 billion respectively which if not utilized will expire at various dates from 2017 through 2036 as of september 1 2016 our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were 604 billion including 428 billion pertaining to japan which will if not utilized substantially all expire at various dates from 2019 through 2025 as of september 1 2016 we had valuation allowances of 116 billion and 765 million against our net deferred tax assets in the us and japan respectivelya change in ownership may limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwardsif we experience a 50 or greater change in ownership involving shareholders owning 5 or more of our stock it could adversely impact our ability to utilize our existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards the inability to utilize existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards would significantly increase the amount of our annual cash taxes reducing the overall amount of cash available to be used in other areas of the businesson july 20 2016 our board of directors adopted a section 382 rights agreement the rights agreement under which our shareholders of record as of the close of business on august 1 2016 received one right for each share of common stock outstanding the rights agreement is intended to avoid an ownership change as defined by section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and thereby preserve our current ability to utilize certain net operating loss and credit carryforwards in general an ownership change will occur when the percentage of our ownership by one or more 5 shareholders has increased by more than 50 at any time during the prior three years pursuant to the rights agreement if a shareholder or group acquires beneficial ownership of 499 or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock without prior approval of our board of directors or without meeting certain customary exceptions the rights would become exercisable and entitle shareholders other than the acquiring shareholder or group to purchase additional shares of our common stock at a significant discount and result in significant dilution in the economic interest and voting power of acquiring shareholder or group although the rights agreement is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect us there is no assurance that the rights agreement will prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change the rights agreement is subject to shareholder approval at the companys fiscal 2016 annual meeting of shareholders if not approved by the shareholders the rights agreement will terminate on july 19 2017the limited availability of raw materials supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionour operations require raw materials and in certain cases third party services that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as silicon wafers controllers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we andor our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials or services is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedour operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the suppliers limited capacity our inability to obtain this equipment timely could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp if we are unable to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 22a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our businessdownturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers mobile devices ssds and servers reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedour results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster fire explosion or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionwe face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionsales to customers outside the united states approximated 84 of our consolidated net sales for 2016 in addition a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states in particular a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore taiwan and japan our international

counterparty default risks we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash deposits investments cappedcall contracts on our stock and derivative instruments as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding in the event of such default we could incur significant losses which could adversely impact our business results of operations or financial

mmj a japanese corporation pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement on support for reorganization companies as amended the sponsor agreement that we entered into in july 2012 with the trustees of the mmj companies pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan the mmj companies filed petitions for commencement of corporate reorganization proceedings with the japan court under the corporate reorganization act of japan in february 2012 and the japan court issued an order to commence the reorganization proceedings the japan proceedings in march 2012 under the sponsor agreement we agreed to provide certain support for the reorganization of the mmj companies and the trustees agreed to prepare and seek approval from the japan court and the mmj companies creditors of plans of reorganization consistent with such supportthe trustees initially submitted the proposed plans of reorganization for the mmj companies to the japan court in august 2012 and submitted final proposed plans in october 2012 in october 2012 the japan court approved submission of the trustees proposed plans of reorganization to creditors for approval in february 2013 the mmj companies creditors approved the reorganization plans and in february 2013 the japan court issued an order approving the plans of reorganization appeals filed by certain creditors of mmj in japan challenging the plan approval order issued by the japan court were deniedin a related action mmj filed a verified petition for recognition and chapter 15 relief in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the us court in march 2012 and in april 2012 the us court entered an order that among other things recognized mmjs corporate reorganization proceeding as a foreign main proceeding pursuant to 11 usc  1517b on june 25 2013 the us court issued a recognition order which recognized the order of the japan court approving mmjs plan of reorganization in november 2013 the us court closed the us chapter 15 proceedingthe plans of reorganization provide for payments by the mmj companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items the plans of reorganization also provided for the investment by us pursuant to the sponsor agreement of 60 billion yen paid at closing in cash into mmj in exchange for 100 ownership of mmjs equity and the use of such investment to fund the initial installment payment by the mmj companies to their creditors of 60 billion yen subject to reduction for certain items specified in the sponsor agreement and plans of reorganizationunder mmjs plan of reorganization secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their fixed claims and unsecured creditors will recover at least 174 of the amount of their fixed claims the actual recovery of unsecured creditors will be higher however based in part on events and circumstances occurring following the plan approval the remaining portion of the unsecured claims will be discharged without payment over the period that payments are made pursuant to the plans of reorganization the secured creditors will be paid in full on or before the sixth installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments mais plan of reorganization provides that secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their claims whereas unsecured creditors will recover 19 of the amount of their claims the secured creditors of mai were paid in full on the first installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installmentsbecause the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of the mmj acquisition the japan proceedings are continuing and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the reorganization proceedings the business trustee makes decisions in relation to the operation of the businesses of the mmj companies other than decisions in relation to acts that need to be carried out in connection with the japan proceedings which are the responsibility of the legal trustee the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court will continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date the mmj companies may petition the japan court for an early termination of the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made although such early terminations are customarily granted there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition in these particular cases 25during the pendency of the japan proceedings the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling material disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively integrate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companiesfor a discussion of other legal proceedings see part ii financial information  item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

237 billion and 268 billion of dram products from inotera in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively dram products purchased from inotera accounted for 30 of our aggregate dram gigabit production for 2016 as compared to 35 for 2015 and 38 for 2014 in 2015 and 2014 our cost for inotera products was higher than our cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to declines in

our cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities for the second and third quarters of 2016 due to improvements in average selling prices in late 2016 coupled with decreases in manufacturing costs of our whollyowned operations our cost for inotera products increased and were approximately 20 higher than our cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities

management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgmentsbusiness acquisitions accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values the items involving the most significant assumptions estimates and judgments include the followingproperty plant and equipment including determination of values in a continueduse modeldeferred tax assets including projections of future taxable income and tax ratesinventory including estimated future selling prices timing of product

allocation rates attributable to the acquired technology and discount rates andpreviously held equity interest including discount rate and projections of future cash flowsconsolidations we have interests in entities that are vies determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing whether an entity is a vie and if we are the entitys primary beneficiary if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we are required to consolidate it to determine if we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies require significant assumptions and judgmentscontingencies we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss if any from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date in accounting for the resolution of contingencies considerable judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods 41goodwill and intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value then goodwill is tested for impairment using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires valuation of all of the reporting units tangible and intangible assets and liabilities if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair valuedetermining when to test for impairment the reporting units the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates forecasted manufacturing costs and other expenses and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process the same estimates are used in business planning forecasting and capital budgeting as part of our longterm manufacturing capacity analysis we test the reasonableness of the output of our longrange planning process by calculating an implied value per share and comparing that to current stock prices analysts consensus pricing and managements expectations these estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit which are discounted using a riskadjusted rate to calculate a fair value the discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimateswe test other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows estimating fair values involves significant assumptions especially regarding future sales prices sales volumes costs and discount ratesincome taxes we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in recent periods our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and taiwan our income tax provision or benefit is dependent in part on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve numerous judgments including among others projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes manufacturing and overhead costs levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realizedinventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value cost includes depreciation labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining net realizable value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting future average selling prices sales volumes and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated net realizable value below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our memory inventory by approximately 234 million as of september 1 2016 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 42us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories in determining the lower of average cost or net realizable value inventories are primarily categorized as memory including dram nonvolatile and other memory based on the major characteristics of product type and markets the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and marketsproperty plant and equipment we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performedwe periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016 for 2016 the effect of the revision was not material see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  significant accounting policiesresearch and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rampd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are included in cost of goods soldstockbased compensation  stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgmentdetermining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stockrecently adopted accounting standards see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  recently adopted accounting standards recently issued accounting standards see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  recently issued accounting standards 43item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate riskwe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio a substantial portion of our indebtedness is at fixed interest rates as a result the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates we estimate that as of september 1 2016 and september 3 2015 a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates of 1 would increase the fair value of our notes payable by approximately 420 million and 366 million respectively a 1 increase in the interest rates of our variablerate debt would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately 10 million per yearas of september 1 2016 and september 3 2015 we held fixedrate debt securities of 111 billion and 383 billion respectively that were subject to interest rate risk we estimate that a 05 increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of these instruments by approximately 1 million as of september 1 2016 and 13 million as of september 3 2015foreign currency exchange rate riskthe information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in part i  item 1a risk factors changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial conditionthe functional currency for us and all of our consolidated subsidiaries is the us dollar the substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the us dollar however significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro singapore dollar new taiwan dollar and yen we have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs which reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposesbased on our foreign currency balances from monetary assets and liabilities we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 241 million as of september 1 2016 and 134 million as of september 3 2015 we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  derivative instrumentsin the second quarter of 2016 we entered into agreements to acquire the remaining interest in inotera based on the exchange rate as of september 1 2016 we estimate the aggregate consideration payable would be approximately 41 billion this payment is contingent upon the closing of the transaction and are therefore not recorded on our balance sheet as of september 1 2016 changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the new taiwan dollar could have a significant impact on our financial statements if the transactions are consummated see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

periods unless otherwise indicatedderivative and hedging instruments  we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we have also had convertible note settlement obligations which were accounted for as derivative instruments as a result of our elections to settle conversions in cash we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes derivative instruments are measured at their fair values and recognized as either assets or liabilities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is based on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges for accounting purpose gains or losses from changes in fair values are recognized in other nonoperating income expense for derivative instruments designated as cashflow hedges the effective portion of the gain or loss is included as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective or excluded portion of the gain or loss is included in other nonoperating income expense amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss from these cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same line items of the consolidated statements of operation and in the same periods in which the underlying transactions affect earnings effectiveness is measured by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item for the effectiveness assessment of our cashflow hedges changes in the time value are excluded for forward contractswe enter into

subsidiariesinventories  inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value cost includes depreciation labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining net realizable value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting future average selling prices sales volumes and costs to complete products in work in process inventories when net realizable value is below cost we record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down inventories to their estimated net realizable value in advance of when the inventories are actually sold in determining the lower of average cost or net realizable value inventories are primarily categorized as memory including dram nonvolatile and other memory based on the major characteristics of product type and markets we remove amounts from inventory and charge such amounts to cost of goods sold on an average cost basis 51product and process technology  costs incurred to 1 acquire product and process technology 2 patent technology and 3 maintain patent technology are capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over periods ranging up to 125 years we capitalize a portion of the costs incurred to patent technology based on historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents we file capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of 1 the estimated useful life of the technology 2 the patent term or 3 the term of the technology agreement fullyamortized assets are removed from product and process

when property plant or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed the net book value is removed and we recognize any gain or loss in our results of operationswe capitalize interest on borrowings during the period of time we carry out the activities necessary to bring asset to the condition of their intended use and location capitalized interest becomes part of the cost and amortized over the useful lives of the assets we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment in the fourth quarter of 2016 we identified factors such as the lengthening period of time between dram product technology node transitions an increased reuse rate of equipment and industry trends as a result we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016 for 2016 the effect of the revision was not materialresearch and development  costs related to the conceptual formulation

carried at cost when we retire our treasury stock any excess of the repurchase price paid over par value is allocated between additional capital and retained earnings use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may differ under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis actual results could differ from estimates 52variable interest entitieswe have interests in entities that are vies if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we are required to consolidate it to determine if

balance sheet classification of deferred taxes which eliminated the requirement to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet we adopted this asu as of the beginning of our second quarter of 2016 on a prospective basis and did not retrospectively adjust prior periods as a result of adopting this standard we presented our deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statementsin september 2015 the fasb issued asu 201516  simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments which eliminated the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments following a business combination instead the cumulative

asu 201613  measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which requires a financial asset or a group of financial assets measured on the basis of amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected this asu requires that the income statement reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period this asu requires that credit losses of debt securities designated as availableforsale be recorded through an allowance for credit losses and limits the credit loss to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost we are required to adopt this asu beginning in our first quarter of 2021 however we are permitted to adopt this asu as early as our first quarter of 2020 this asu is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach with prospective adoption for debt securities for which an otherthantemporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date we are evaluating the timing and effects of our adoption of this asu on our financial statementsin march 2016 the fasb

classification of awards as either equity or liabilities forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows we expect to adopt this asu beginning in our first quarter of 2017 and expect to elect to account for forfeitures when they occur this asu allows for prospective retrospective or modified retrospective adoption depending on the aspect covered we do not anticipate the adoption of this asu to have a material impact to our financial statements in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602  leases which amends a number of aspects of lease accounting including requiring lessees to

generally accepted accounting principles in the us the core principal of this asu as amended is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this asu also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a

netherlands subsidiary micron bv in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron bv and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron bv purchased substantially all of qimondas shares of inotera memories inc the inotera shares which represents approximately 55 of our total shares in inotera as of september 1 2016 and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks among other things to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent crosslicense between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreementfollowing a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate on march 13 2014 the court issued judgments 1 ordering micron bv to pay approximately 1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase 2 ordering micron bv to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties 3 ordering micron bv to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares including in particular any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits 4 denying qimondas claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera and 5 determining that qimondas obligations under the patent crosslicense agreement are canceled in addition the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering among other things 1 that micron bv transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by it and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties and 2 that micron bv pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares the interlocutory judgments have no immediate enforceable effect on us and accordingly we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case we have filed a notice of appeal and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals courtwe are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages

converted to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount we could pay cash shares of common stock or a combination thereof at our option for the amount of such excess the 2033 notes were convertible at the option of the holders as of september 3 2015 and the aggregate difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of 49 million was classified as redeemable convertible notes in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet due to declines in the trading price of our common stock during 2016 the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed the thresholds for the calendar quarter ended june 30 2016 therefore the 2033 notes were not convertible by the holders during the calendar quarter ended september 30 2016 as a result in 2016 the 2033 notes were classified as noncurrent debt and the aggregate difference between the principal amount and the carrying value were reclassified from redeemable convertible notes to additional capital the closing price of our common stock exceeded the thresholds for the calendar quarter ended september 30 2016 therefore the 2033 notes as well as the 2032 notes are convertible by the holders through

for each share of common stock outstanding the rights agreement is intended to avoid an ownership change as defined by section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and thereby preserve our current ability to utilize certain net operating loss and credit carryforwards in general an ownership change will occur when the percentage of our ownership by one or more 5 shareholders has increased by more than 50 at any time during the prior three years pursuant to the rights agreement if a shareholder or group acquires beneficial ownership of 499 or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock without prior approval of our board of directors or without meeting certain customary exceptions the rights would become exercisable and entitle shareholders other than the acquiring shareholder or group to purchase additional shares of our common stock at a significant discount and result in significant dilution in the economic interest and voting power of acquiring shareholder or group although the rights agreement is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect us there is no assurance that the rights agreement will prevent all

562we have not recognized deferred tax assets of 325 million for excess tax benefits that arose directly from tax deductions related to equity compensation greater than amounts recognized for financial reporting these excess stock compensation benefits will be credited to additional capital if realized we use the with and without method as described in asc 740 for purposes of determining when excess tax benefits have been realizedprovision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries to the extent that dividend payments from such companies are expected to result in additional tax liabilities remaining undistributed earnings of 674 billion as of september 1 2016 have been indefinitely reinvested therefore no provision has been made for taxes due on approximately 782 billion of the excess of the financial reporting amount over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested generally this amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from the subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of the subsidiary determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries is not practicablebelow is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefitsfor the year ended 2016 2015 2014beginning unrecognized tax

which if recognized would affect our effective tax rate the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits in 2016 primarily related to the favorable resolution of certain prior year tax matters we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters within income tax expense as of september 3 2015 and august 28 2014 the amount accrued for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions was 16 million and 19 million respectively and were not material as of september 1 2016 the resolution of tax audits or lapses of statute of limitations could also reduce our unrecognized tax benefits although the timing of final resolution is uncertain the estimated potential reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months would not be material we and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with the us federal government various us states and various foreign jurisdictions throughout the world our us federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2012 through 2016 in addition tax returns open to examination in singapore japan and taiwan range from the years 2011 to 2016 we believe that adequate amounts of taxes and related interest and penalties

and substantially all of our sales to kingston were included in our cnbu and sbu segmentswe generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and production equipment however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and production equipment that meet our standards in some cases materials or production equipment are provided by a single supplierfinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash money market accounts certificates of deposit fixedrate debt securities trade receivables and derivative contracts we invest through highcreditquality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor and monitoring credit risk of bank counterparties on an ongoing basis a concentration of credit risk may exist with respect to receivables as a substantial portion of our customers are affiliated with the computing industry we perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers worldwide and generally do not require collateral from our customers historically we have not experienced material losses on receivables a concentration of risk may also exist with respect to derivatives as the number of counterparties to our currency hedges is limited and the notional amounts are relatively large we seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and through entering into master netting arrangements capped calls expose us to credit risk to the extent the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements we seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across several major financial institutions in addition the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basisgeographic
