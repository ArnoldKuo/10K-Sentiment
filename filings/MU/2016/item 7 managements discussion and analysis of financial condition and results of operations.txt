margin percentage for 2016 was relatively unchanged from 2015 as manufacturing cost reductions offset declines in average selling prices 31from january 2013 through december 2015 we purchased all of inoteras dram output under supply agreements at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components effective beginning on january 1 2016 the price for dram products purchased by us is based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us we purchased 143 billion 237 billion and 268 billion of dram products from inotera in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively dram products purchased from inotera accounted for 30 of our aggregate dram gigabit production for 2016 as compared to 35 for 2015 and 38 for 2014 in 2015 and 2014 our cost for inotera products was higher than our cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to declines in average selling prices our per gigabit cost of products purchased from inotera decreased throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016 such that our cost for inotera products more closely approximated our cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities for the second and third quarters of 2016 due to improvements in average selling prices in late 2016 coupled with decreases in manufacturing costs of our whollyowned operations our cost for inotera products increased and were approximately 20 higher than our cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities for the fourth quarter of 2016 the current supply agreement with inotera has an initial threeyear term which commenced on january 1 2016 followed by a threeyear winddown period upon termination of the initial threeyear term the share of inoteras capacity we would purchase would decline over the winddown periodour overall gross margin percentage declined to 32 for 2015 from 33 for 2014 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions cnbu and sbu experienced declines in gross margin percentage for 2015 as compared to 2014 as declines in average selling price outpaced manufacturing cost reductions mbus gross margin percentage for 2015 improved as compared to 2014 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling pricesdue to the lengthening period of time between dram product technology node transitions an increased reuse rate of equipment and industry trends we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016 for 2016 the effect of the revision was not material and we expect this change will reduce depreciation costs by approximately 100 million per quarter in future periodsoperating results by business

quarter of 2016 we initiated a restructure plan in response to the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on our key priorities in which we expect to save as compared to our previously planned spending levels approximately 80 million per quarter in 2017 the savings are expected to result from a combination of a more focused set of projects and programs the permanent closure of a number of open headcount requisitions workforce reductions in certain areas of the business and other nonheadcount related spending reductions see item 8 financial statements and

reflecting provisions on nonus operations our effective tax rates reflect the followingoperations in tax jurisdictions including singapore and taiwan where our earnings are indefinitely reinvested and the tax rates are significantly lower than the us statutory rateoperations outside the us including singapore and to a lesser extent taiwan where we have tax incentive arrangements that further decrease our effective tax rates anda valuation allowance against substantially all of our us net deferred tax assets income taxes for 2016 2015 and 2014 included 114 million 80 million and 59 million respectively related to utilization of and other changes in deferred tax assets of mmj and mmt income taxes for 2016 also included tax benefits of 58 million related to the favorable resolution of certain prior year tax matters which were previously reserved as uncertain tax positions and 41 million related to a us valuation allowance release resulting from the acquisition of tidal systems ltd the remaining tax provision for 2016 2015 and 2014 primarily reflects taxes on our other nonus operations income taxes on us operations for 2016 2015 and 2014 were substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowancewe have a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset associated with our us operations management continues to evaluate future projected financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support a reduction in or reversal of the valuation allowance the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if sufficient positive evidence existswe operate in a number of locations outside the us including singapore and to a lesser extent taiwan where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds the benefit of tax incentive arrangements which expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2030 was not material to

netother nonoperating income expense netliquidity and capital resourcesour primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products which can vary significantly from period to period we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures and ongoing operations we expect from time to time in the future to engage in a variety of transactions for such purposes including the issuance or incurrence of secured and unsecured debt and the refinancing and restructuring of existing debt as of september 1 2016 we had a revolving credit facility available for up to 488 million of additional financing based on eligible receivables we expect that our cash and investments cash flows from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 monthsto develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and equipment and rampd we estimate that net cash expenditures in 2017 for property plant and equipment will be approximately 48 billion to 52 billion which reflects the offset of amounts we expect to be funded by our partners the actual amounts for 2017 will vary depending on market conditions total additions to property plant and equipment in 2016 were 701 billion which in comparison to cash expenditures reflects differences in timing of receipts and payments for equipment as well as noncash additions such as equipment leases as of september 1 2016 we had commitments of approximately 780 million for the

additionally amounts include a portion of the expected costs which meet the criteria of a minimum operating lease payment under our inotera supply agreement4  purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria 1 they are noncancelable 2 we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled or 3 we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services takeorpay if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable the entire value of the contract was included in the above table if the obligation is cancelable but we would incur a penalty if canceled the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation contracted minimum amounts specified in takeorpay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment5  amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other longterm liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet including 349 million for the current portion of these longterm liabilities we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future certain payments related to uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities therefore the amount has been excluded from the preceding table however other noncurrent liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet included these uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilitiesthe expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services market prices changes to agreedupon amounts or timing of certain events for some obligations the contractual obligations in the table above include the current portions of the related longterm obligations all other current liabilities are excluded 40offbalance sheet arrangementswe have entered into capped calls which are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution from our convertible notes the capped calls provide for our receipt of cash or shares at our election from our counterparties if the trading price of our stock is above a specified initial strike price at the expiration dates the amounts receivable vary based on the trading price of our stock up to specified cap prices the dollar value of the cash or shares that we would receive from the capped calls on their expiration dates ranges from 0 if the trading price of our stock is below the initial strike price for all of the capped calls to 719 million if the trading price of our stock is at or above the cap price for all of the capped calls we paid 103 million in 2012 and 48 million in 2013 to purchase capped calls the amounts paid were recorded as charges to additional capital for further details of our capped call arrangements see item 8 financial statements

related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgmentsbusiness acquisitions accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values the items involving the most significant assumptions estimates and judgments include the followingproperty plant and equipment including determination of values in a continueduse modeldeferred tax assets including projections of future taxable income and tax ratesinventory including estimated future selling prices timing of product sales and completion costs for work in process debt including discount rate and timing of paymentsintangible assets including valuation methodology estimations of future revenue and costs profit allocation rates attributable to the acquired technology and discount rates andpreviously held equity interest including discount rate and projections of future cash flowsconsolidations we have interests in entities that are vies determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing whether an entity is a vie and if we are the entitys primary beneficiary if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we are required to consolidate it to determine if we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies require significant assumptions and judgmentscontingencies we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss if any from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date in accounting for the resolution of contingencies considerable judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods 41goodwill and intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value then goodwill is tested for impairment using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires valuation of all of the reporting units tangible and intangible assets and liabilities if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair valuedetermining when to test for impairment the reporting units the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates forecasted manufacturing costs and other expenses and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process the same estimates are used in business planning forecasting and capital budgeting as part of our longterm manufacturing capacity analysis we test the reasonableness of the output of our longrange planning process by calculating an implied value per share and comparing that to current stock prices analysts consensus pricing and managements expectations these estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit which are discounted using a riskadjusted rate to calculate a fair value the discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimateswe test other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows estimating fair values involves significant assumptions especially regarding future sales prices sales volumes costs and discount ratesincome taxes we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in recent periods our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and taiwan our income tax provision or benefit is dependent in part on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve numerous judgments including among others projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes manufacturing and overhead costs levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realizedinventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value cost includes depreciation labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining net realizable value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting future average selling prices sales volumes and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated net realizable value below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our memory inventory by approximately 234 million as of september 1 2016 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 42us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories in determining the lower of average cost or net realizable value inventories are primarily categorized as memory including dram nonvolatile and other memory based on the major characteristics of product type and markets the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and marketsproperty plant and equipment we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performedwe periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016 for 2016 the effect of the revision was not material see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  significant accounting policiesresearch and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rampd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are included in cost of goods soldstockbased compensation  stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgmentdetermining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards we estimate stock price volatility
