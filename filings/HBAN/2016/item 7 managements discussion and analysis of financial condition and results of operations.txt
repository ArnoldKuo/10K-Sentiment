year earnings per common share for the year were 081 up 13 from the prior year this resulted in a 101 return on average assets and a 124 return on average tangible common equity in addition we grew our base of consumer and business customers as we increased 2015 average earning assets by 53 billion or 9 over the prior year our strategic business investments and ocr sales approach continued to generate positive results in 2015 also see significant items influencing financial performance comparisons within the discussion of results of operationsfullytaxable equivalent net interest income was 20 billion in 2015 an increase of 118 million or 6 compared with 2014 this reflected the impact of 9 earning asset growth 7 interestbearing liability growth and an 8 basis point decrease in the nim to 315 the earning asset growth reflected a 32 billion or 7 increase in average loans and leases and a 18 billion or 15 increase in average securities the increase in average loans and leases primarily reflected growth in campi related to the acquisition of huntington technology finance and automobile loans as originations remained strong the increase in average securities primarily reflected the additional investment in lcr level 1 qualifying securities and the ongoing origination of direct purchase municipal instruments the increase in interestbearing liabilities primarily reflected growth in money market deposits related to continued 30table of contentsbanker focus across all segments on obtaining our customers full deposit relationship an increase in total debt related to the issuance of banklevel senior debt during 2015 and an increase in brokered deposits and negotiated cds which were used to efficiently finance balance sheet growth while continuing to manage the overall cost of funds this was partially offset by a decrease in average core certificates of deposit due to the strategic focus on changing the funding sources to low and no cost demand deposits and money market deposits the nim contraction reflected a 6 basis point decrease related to the mix and yield of earning assets and a 3 basis point increase in funding costs partially offset by the 1 basis point increase in the benefit to the margin from the impact of noninterestbearing funds overall asset quality remains strong with modest volatility based on the absolute low level of problem credits the provision for credit losses was 100 million in 2015 an increase of 19 million or 23 compared with 2014 nals increased 71 million or 24 from the prior year to 372 million or 074 of total loans and leases the increase was centered in the commercial portfolio and was comprised of several large oil and gas exploration and production relationships npas increased 61 million or 18 from the prior year to 399 million or 079 of total loans and leases and net oreo ncos decreased 37 million or 30 from the prior year to 88 million ncos represented an annualized 018 of average loans and leases in the current year compared to 027 in 2014 we continue to be pleased with the net chargeoff performance across the entire portfolio as we remain below our targeted range overall consumer credit metrics led by the home equity portfolio continue to show an improving trend while the commercial portfolios continue to experience some quartertoquarter volatility based on the absolute low level of problem loans acl as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 133 from 140 a year ago while the acl as a percentage of periodend total nals decreased to 180 from 222 management believes the level of the acl is appropriate given the current composition of the overall loan and lease portfolio noninterest income was 10 billion in 2015 an increase of 60 million or 6 compared with 2014 this reflected an increase in cards and payment processing income mortgage banking income and gain on sale of loans cards and payment processing income increased due to higher card related income and underlying customer growth the increase in mortgage banking income was primarily driven by a 33 million or 58 increase in origination and secondary marketing revenue gain on sale of loans increased due to an automobile loan securitization during 2015 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in securities gains and trust services in 2014 we adjusted the mix of our securities portfolio to prepare for the lcr requirements which resulted in securities gains the decrease in trust services primarily related to our fiduciary trust businesses moving to a more open architecture platform and a decline in assets under management in proprietary mutual funds during the 2015 fourth quarter huntington sold haa hasi and unified noninterest expense was 20 billion in 2015 an increase of 94 million or 5 compared with 2014 this reflected an increase in personnel costs other expense and outside data processing and other services personnel costs increased primarily due to an increase in salaries related to annual merit increases the addition of huntington technology finance and a 3 increase in the number of average fulltime equivalent employees largely related to the buildout of the instore strategy other noninterest expense increased due to an increase in operating lease expense related to huntington technology finance outside data processing and other services increased primarily reflecting higher debit and credit card processing costs and increased other technology investment expense as we continue to invest in technology supporting our products services and our continuous improvement initiatives these increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangibles reflecting the full amortization of the core deposit intangible from the sky

important component of the economy in our footprint and it appears poised for another good year in 2016 other industries that contribute meaningfully to the regional economy such as health care medical devices and medical technology and higher education among others also remain positive conversely the low energy prices have negatively impacted certain sectors of the energy industry including

interest income  average balance sheetour primary source of revenue is net interest income which is the difference between interest income from earning assets primarily loans securities and direct financing leases and interest expense of funding sources primarily interestbearing deposits and borrowings earning asset balances and related funding sources as well as changes in the levels of interest rates impact net interest income the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interestbearing liabilities is the net interest spread noninterestbearing sources of funds such as demand deposits and shareholders equity also support earning assets the impact of the noninterestbearing sources of funds often referred to as free funds is captured in the net interest margin which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a fullytaxable equivalent basis which means that taxfree interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income assuming a 35 tax ratethe following table shows changes in fullytaxable equivalent interest

matters section of item 1 of this form 10ksome of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit market liquidity operational and compliance risks are described in the following paragraphscredit riskcredit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending we also have credit risk associated with our afs and htm securities portfolios see note 4 and note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management mortgage banking and trading activities while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity we believe this exposure is minimalwe continue to focus on the identification monitoring and managing of our credit risk in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes market risk management activities and portfolio diversification we use quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources enhanced use of modeling technology and internal stress testing processes our portfolio management resources demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile in our efforts to continue to identify risk mitigation techniques we have focused on product design features origination policies and solutions for delinquent or stressed borrowers the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers all authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type geography industry and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives although we offer a broad set of products we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk portfolio profilethe checks and balances in the credit process and the separation of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and provide for effective problem asset management and resolution for example we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage positionour asset quality indicators reflected overall stabilization of our credit quality performance in 2015 compared to 2014loan and lease credit exposure mixat december 31 2015 our loans and leases totaled 503 billion representing a 27 billion or 6 increase compared to 477 billion at december 31 2014 there was continued growth in the campi portfolio primarily as a result of an increase in equipment leases of 08 billion related to the acquisition of huntington technology finance in addition the automobile portfolio increased by 43table of contents08 billion as a result of strong originations the cre portfolio had modest growth over the period as the continued runoff of the noncore portfolio was more than offset by new production within the requirements associated with our internal concentration limits total commercial loans and leases were 258 billion at december 31 2015 and represented 51 of our total loan and lease credit exposure our commercial loan portfolio is diversified along product type customer size and geography within our footprint and is comprised of the following see commercial credit discussioncampi  campi loans and leases are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs equipment purchases or other projects the majority of these borrowers are customers doing business within our geographic regions campi loans and leases are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company andor the personal guarantee of the business owners the financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a campi loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral this treatment is a result of the credit decision process which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt the operation sale rental or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans as we have expanded our campi portfolio we have developed a series of vertical specialties to ensure that new products or lending types are embedded within a structured centralized commercial lending area with designated experienced credit officers these specialties are comprised of either targeted industries for example healthcare food amp agribusiness energy etc andor lending disciplines equipment finance abl etc all of which requires a high degree of expertise and oversight to effectively mitigate and monitor risk as such we have dedicated colleagues and teams focused on bringing value added expertise to these specialty clients cre  cre loans consist of loans to developers and reits supporting incomeproducing or forsale commercial real estate properties we mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement these loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings office and industrial buildings and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation sale or refinance of the propertyconstruction cre  construction cre loans are loans to developers companies or individuals used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property our construction cre portfolio primarily consists of retail multi family office and warehouse project types generally these loans are for construction projects that have been presold or preleased or have secured permanent financing as well as loans to real estate companies with significant equity invested in each project these loans are underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate lending group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction scheduletotal consumer loans and leases were 245 billion at december 31 2015 and represented 49 of our total loan and lease credit exposure the consumer portfolio is comprised primarily of automobile loans home equity loans and linesofcredit and residential mortgages see consumer credit discussion the increase from december 31 2014 primarily relates to growth in the automobile portfolioautomobile  automobile loans are comprised primarily of loans made through automotive dealerships and include exposure in selected states outside of our primary banking markets the exposure

juniorlien on the borrowers residence allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home or refinance existing mortgage debt products include closedend loans which are generally fixedrate

to a 20year amortizing structure at the end of the revolving period applications are underwritten centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system the home equity underwriting criteria is based on minimum credit scores debttoincome ratios and ltv ratios with current collateral valuations the underwriting for the floating rate lines of credit also incorporates a stress analysis for a rising interest rateresidential mortgage  residential mortgage loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence these loans are generally financed over a 15year to

guidance there were no commercial loans outstanding that would be considered a concentration of lending to a particular industry or group of industriesour loan portfolio is diversified by consumer and commercial credit at the corporate level we manage the credit exposure in part via a credit concentration policy the policy designates specific loan types collateral types and loan structures to be formally tracked and assigned limits as a percentage of capital campi lending by naics categories specific limits for cre primary project types loans secured by residential real estate shared national credit exposure and designated high risk loan definitions represent examples of specifically tracked components of our concentration management process currently there are no identified concentrations that exceed the established limit our concentration management policy is approved by the risk oversight committee roc and is one of the strategies used to ensure a high quality well diversified

primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower assessment of the borrowers management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process we utilize a centralized preview and senior loan approval committee led by our chief credit officer the risk rating see next paragraph and complexity of the credit determines the threshold for approval of the senior loan committee with a minimum credit exposure of 100 million for loans not requiring senior loan committee approval with the exception of small business loans credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority for small business loans we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures in this centralized decision environment certain individuals who understand each local region may make creditextension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities in which we operate in addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval processin commercial lending ongoing credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan we monitor all significant exposures on an ongoing basis all commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrowers pd and lgd this twodimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process the pd is rated and applied at the borrower level the lgd is rated and applied based on the specific type of credit extension and the quality and lien position associated with the underlying collateral the internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each periodic monitoring event there is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an ongoing basis we continually review and adjust our riskrating criteria based on actual experience which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate allowance for credit losses acl amount for the commercial portfolio a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio including small business loans to provide consistent oversightin addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and risk of new loan originations this group is part of our risk management area and conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans validate risk ratings and test the consistency of credit processesour standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment one of which is guarantor support on an annual basis or more frequently if warranted we consider among other things the guarantors reputation and creditworthiness along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth assuming 46table of contentssuch information is available our assessment of the guarantors credit strength or lack thereof is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans which is directly tied to and an integral component of our acl methodology when a loan goes to impaired status viable guarantor support is considered in the determination of a credit lossif our assessment of the guarantors credit strength yields an inherent capacity to perform we will seek repayment from the guarantor as part of the collection process and have done so successfully substantially all loans categorized as classified see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements are managed by our special assets division sad is a specialized group of credit professionals that handle the daytoday management of workouts commercial recoveries and problem loan sales its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans assessing risk ratings and determining the appropriateness of the allowance the accrual status and the ultimate collectability of the classified loan portfoliocampi portfoliothe campi portfolio is comprised of loans to businesses where the source of repayment is associated with the ongoing operations of the business generally the loans are secured by the borrowers assets such as equipment accounts receivable andor inventory in many cases the loans are secured by real estate although the operation sale or refinancing of the real estate is not a primary source of repayment for the loan for loans secured by real estate appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirementswe manage the risks inherent in the campi portfolio through origination policies a defined loan concentration policy with established limits ongoing loan level reviews and portfolio level reviews recourse requirements and continuous portfolio risk management activities our origination policies for the campi portfolio include loan producttype specific policies such as ltv and debt service coverage ratios as applicable currently a higherrisk segment of the campi portfolio is loans to borrowers supporting oil and gas exploration and production and is further described below the campi portfolio continues to have solid origination activity as evidenced by its growth over the past 12 months and we maintain a focus on high quality originations problem loans had trended downward over the last several years reflecting a combination of proactive risk identification and effective workout strategies implemented by the sad however over the past year campi problem loans began to increase primarily as a result of the oil and gas exploration and production customers and the increase in overall portfolio size we continue to maintain a proactive approach to identifying borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty in order to maximize the potential solutions subsequent to the origination of the loan the credit review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new loan originationswe have a dedicated energy lending group that focuses on upstream companies exploration and production or eampp firms as well as midstream pipeline transportation companies this lending group is comprised of colleagues with many years of experience in this area of specialized lending through several economic cycles the exposure to the eampp companies is centered in broadly syndicated reservebased loans and is 05 of our total loans all of these loans are secured and in a firstlien position the customer base consists of larger firms that generally have had access to the capital markets andor are backed by private equity firms this lending group has no exposure to oil field services companies however we have a few legacy oil field services customers for which the remaining aggregate credit exposure is negligiblethe significant reduction in oil and gas prices over the past year has had a negative impact on the energy industry particularly exploration and production companies as well as the oil field services providers the impact of low prices for an extended period of time has had some level of adverse impact on most if not all borrowers in this segment most of these borrowers have therefore had recent downward adjustments to their risk ratings which has increased our loan loss reserve we have other energy related exposures including gas stations wholesale distributors mining and utilities we continue to monitor these exposures closely however these exposures have different factors affecting their performance and we have not seen the same level of volatility in performance or risk rating migration  cre portfoliowe manage the risks inherent in this portfolio specific to cre lending focusing on the quality of the developer and the specifics associated with each project generally we 1 limit our loans to 80 of the appraised value of the commercial real estate at origination 2 require net operating cash flows to be 125 of required interest and principal payments and 3 if the commercial real estate is nonowner occupied require that at least 50 of the space of the project be preleased we actively monitor both geographic and projecttype concentrations and performance metrics of all cre loan types with a focus on loans identified as higher risk based on the risk rating methodology both macrolevel and loanlevel stresstest scenarios based on existing and forecast market conditions are part of the ongoing portfolio management process for the cre portfolio47table of contentsdedicated real estate professionals originate and manage the portfolio the portfolio is diversified by project type and loan size and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio subsequent to the origination of the loan the credit review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new loan originationsappraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals and on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements and to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the ongoing management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions appraisals are obtained from approved vendors and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process we continue to perform ongoing portfolio level reviews within the cre portfolio these reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the projects being reviewed this highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers as well as an indepth knowledge of cre project lending and the market environmentconsumer creditconsumer credit approvals are based on among other factors the financial strength and payment history of the borrower type of exposure and transaction structure consumer credit decisions are generally made in a centralized environment utilizing decision models importantly certain individuals who understand each local region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our focus on the local communities in which we operate each credit extension is assigned a specific pd and lgd the pd is generally based on the borrowers most recent credit bureau score fico which we update quarterly providing an ongoing view of the borrowers pd the lgd is related to the type of collateral associated with the credit extension which typically does not change over the course of the loan term this allows huntington to maintain a current view of the customer for credit risk management and acl purposes in consumer lending credit risk is managed from a segment ie loan type collateral position geography etc and vintage performance analysis all portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators we make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio which may result in changes to future origination strategies the ongoing analysis and review process results in a determination of an appropriate alll amount for our consumer loan portfolio the independent risk management group has a consumer process review component to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processescollection action is initiated as needed through a centrally managed collection and recovery function the collection group employs a series of collection methodologies designed to maintain a

tdrs transferred from loans to loans held for sale at september 30 2015our strategy is to structure tdrs in a manner that avoids new concessions subsequent to the initial tdr terms however there are times when subsequent modifications are required such as when the modified loan matures often the loans are performing in accordance with the tdr terms and a new note is originated with similar modified terms these loans are subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing if the loan is not performing in accordance with the existing tdr terms typically an individualized approach to repayment is established in accordance with asc 3102035 the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan a new loan is considered for removal of the tdr designation a continuation of the prior note requires the continuation of the tdr designation and because the refinanced note constitutes a new or amended debt instrument it is included in our tdr activity table below as a new tdr and a restructured tdr removal during the periodthe types of concessions granted are consistent with those granted on new tdrs and include interest rate reductions amortization or maturity date changes beyond what the collateral supports and principal forgiveness based on the borrowers specific 52table of contentsneeds at a point in time our policy does not limit the number of times a loan may be modified a loan may be modified multiple times if it is considered to be in the best interest of both the borrower and huntingtoncommercial loans are not automatically considered to be accruing tdrs upon the granting of a new concession if the loan is in accruing status and no loss is expected based on the modified terms the modified tdr remains in accruing status for loans that are on nonaccrual status before the modification collection of both principal and interest must not be in doubt and the borrower must be able to exhibit sufficient cash flows for at least a sixmonth period of time to service the debt in order to return to accruing status this sixmonth period could extend before or after the restructure dateany granted change in terms or conditions that are not readily available in the market for that borrower requires the designation as a tdr there are no provisions for the removal of the tdr designation based on payment activity for consumer loans a loan may be returned to accrual status when all contractually due interest and principal has

which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the alll and the aulc combined these reserves comprise the total acl our acl methodology committee is responsible for developing the methodology assumptions and estimates used in the calculation as well as determining the appropriateness of the acl the alll represents the estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reported date additions to the alll result from recording provision expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting from loan riskrating downgrades while reductions reflect chargeoffs net of recoveries decreased risk levels resulting from loan riskrating upgrades or the sale of loans the aulc is determined by applying the same quantitative reserve determination process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectationduring the 2015 first quarter we reviewed our existing commercial and consumer credit models and enhanced certain processes and methods of acl estimation during this review we updated our analysis of the loss emergence periods used for consumer receivables collectively evaluated for impairment and as a result extended our loss emergence periods for products within these portfolios as part of these enhancements to our credit reserve process we also evaluated the methods used to separately estimate economic risks inherent in our portfolios and decided to no longer utilize these separate estimation techniques rather we now incorporate economic risks in our loss estimates as a component of our reserve calculation the enhancements made to our credit reserve processes during the 2015 first quarter allow for increased segmentation and analysis of the estimated incurred losses within our loan portfolios the net acl impact of these enhancements was immaterial53table of contentsduring the 2015 third quarter we reviewed our existing commercial and consumer credit models and completed a periodic reassessment of certain acl assumptions specifically we updated our analysis of the loss emergence periods used for commercial receivables collectively evaluated for impairment based on our observed portfolio experience we extended our loss emergence periods for the campi portfolio and cre portfolios we also updated loss factors in our consumer home equity and residential mortgage portfolios based on more recently observed portfolio experience the net acl impact of these enhancements was immaterialwe regularly evaluate the appropriateness of the acl by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above additional factors considered include the impact of increasing or decreasing residential real estate values the diversification of cre loans the development of new or expanded commercial business verticals such as healthcare abl and energy a provision for credit

is helpful to understand the process of how commercial loans are treated as they deteriorate over time the alll established is consistent with the level of risk associated with the original underwriting as a part of our normal portfolio management process for commercial loans the loan is periodically reviewed and the alll is increased or decreased based on the updated risk rating in certain cases the standard alll is determined to not be appropriate and a specific reserve is established based on the projected cash flow or collateral value of the specific loan chargeoffs if necessary are generally recognized in a period after the specific alll was established if the previously established alll exceeds that necessary to satisfactorily resolve the problem loan a reduction in the overall level of the alll could be recognized consumer loans are treated in much the same manner as commercial loans with increasing reserve factors applied based on the risk characteristics of the loan although specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans in summary if loan quality deteriorates the typical credit sequence would be periods of reserve building followed by periods of higher ncos as the previously established alll is utilized additionally an increase in the alll either precedes or is in conjunction with increases in nals when a loan is classified as nal it is evaluated for specific alll or chargeoff as a result an increase in nals does not necessarily result in an increase in the alll or an expectation of higher future ncosall residential mortgage loans greater than 150days past due are chargeddown to the estimated value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs the remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be

changes in market values of assets and liabilities we incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads we have identified two primary sources of market risk interest rate risk and price riskinterest rate riskoverviewhuntington actively manages interest rate risk as changes in market interest rates can have a significant impact on reported earnings the interest rate risk process is designed to compare income simulations under different market scenarios designed to alter the direction

161 million 18 million was recorded using the fair value method and 143 million was recorded using the amortization methodmsr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be reduced by prepayments prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise we have employed strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment however volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges we report msr fair value adjustments net of hedgerelated trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking incomemsrs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with

arrangements these arrangements include commitments to extend credit interest rate swaps financial guarantees contained in standby lettersofcredit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loanscommitments to extend creditcommitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates are variablerate and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly shortterm variablerate nature see note 20 for more informationinterest rate swapsbalance sheet hedging activity is arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment and is classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges fair value hedges are purchased to convert deposits and longterm debt from fixedrate obligations to floating rate cash flow hedges are also used to convert floating rate loans made to

such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters and security risks we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations and to improve the oversight of our operational risk we actively and continuously monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data we evaluate internal systems processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any material lossesour objective for managing cyber security risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems we work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals to this end we employ a set of defense indepth strategies which include efforts to make huntington less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response potential concerns related to cyber security may be escalated to our boardlevel technology committee as appropriate as a complement to the overall cyber security risk management we use a number of internal training methods both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks we also use thirdparty services to test the effectiveness of our cyber security risk management framework and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentialityto mitigate operational risks we have a senior management operational risk committee and a senior management legal regulatory and compliance committee the responsibilities of these committees among other duties include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns risks or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues in addition we have a senior management model risk oversight committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise these committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the risk management committee potential concerns may be escalated to our roc as appropriatethe goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies minimize operational fraud and legal losses minimize the impact of

significant items and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the five business segmentsfunds transfer pricing ftp71table of contentswe use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury  other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury  other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilitiesnet income by business segmentthe segregation of net income by business segment for the past three years is presented in the following table

1 the number of checking account households 2 product penetration by number of services and 3 the revenue generated from the consumer households of all business segmentsthe growth in consumer checking account number of households is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing checking account households the overall objective is to grow the number of households along with an increase in product penetrationwe use the checking account as a measure since it typically represents the primary banking relationship product we count additional services by type not number of services for example a household that has one checking account and one mortgage we count as having two services a household with four checking accounts we count as having one service the household relationship 72table of contentsutilizing 6 services is viewed to be more profitable and loyal the overall objective therefore is to decrease the percentage of 15 services per consumer

metrics 1 the number of checking account commercial relationships 2 product penetration by number of services and 3 the revenue generated commercial relationships include relationships from all business segments the growth in the number of commercial relationships is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing commercial accounts the overall objective is to grow the number of relationships along with an increase in product service distributionthe commercial relationship is defined as a business banking or commercial banking customer with a checking account relationship we use this metric because we believe that the checking account anchors a business relationship and creates the opportunity to increase our crosssell activity multiple sales of

understanding huntingtons results of operations or financial position where nongaap financial measures are used the comparable gaap financial measure as well as the reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure can be found herein significant itemsfrom timetotime revenue expenses or taxes are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities andor by items that while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or shortterm in nature we refer to such items as significant items most often these significant items result from factors originating outside the company eg regulatory actions  assessments windfall gains changes in accounting principles onetime tax assessments  refunds litigation actions etc in other cases they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business eg merger  restructuring charges recapitalization actions goodwill impairment etceven though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions as a general rule volatility alone does not define a significant item for example changes in the provision for credit losses gains  losses from investment activities asset valuation writedowns etc reflect ordinary banking activities and are therefore typically excluded from consideration as a significant itemwe believe the disclosure of significant items provides a better understanding of our performance and trends to ascertain which of such items if any to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance ie within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations as well as how if at all to adjust estimates of future performance accordingly to this end we adopted a practice of listing significant items in our external disclosure documents eg earnings press releases investor presentations forms 10q and 10ksignificant items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performancefullytaxable equivalent basisinterest income yields and ratios on a fte basis are considered nongaap financial measures management believes net interest income on a fte basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes the fte basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and taxexempt sources the fte basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent we encourage readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10k in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measurenonregulatory capital ratiosin addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy includingtangible common equity to tangible assetstier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets using basel i definitions andtangible common equity to riskweighted assets using basel i and basel iii definitions90table of contentsthese nonregulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the companys capitalization to other financial services companies these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies these ratios are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap or federal banking regulations as a result these nonregulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company are considered nongaap financial measuresbecause there are no standardized definitions for these nonregulatory capital ratios the companys calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies also there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors as a result the company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10k in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measurerisk factorsmore

the risk management and capital discussion as well as the regulatory matters section included in item 1 and incorporated by reference into the mdampacritical accounting policies and use of significant estimatesour consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference into this mdampa describes the significant accounting policies we use in our consolidated financial statementsan accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed belowallowance for credit lossesour acl of 07 billion at december 31 2015 represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risk associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsvaluation of financial instrumentsassets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility assets measured at fair value include certain loans held for sale loans held for investment availableforsale and trading securities certain securitized automobile loans msrs derivatives and certain shortterm borrowings at december 31 2015 approximately 91 billion of our assets and 01 billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in addition to the above mentioned ongoing fair value measurements fair value is also used for recording business combinations and measuring other nonrecurring financial assets and liabilities at the end of each quarter we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured at fair value as necessary assets or liabilities may be transferred within fair value hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement datewhere available we use quoted market prices to determine fair value if quoted market prices are not available fair value is determined using either internally developed or independent thirdparty valuation models based on inputs that are either directly observable or derived from market data these inputs include but are not limited to interest rate yield curves option volatilities or option adjusted spreads where neither quoted market prices nor observable market data are available fair value is determined using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on managements expectation that market participants 91table of contentswould use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability the determination of appropriate unobservable inputs requires exercise of significant judgment a significant portion of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value are measured based on quoted market prices or observable market independent inputsthe following is a description of the significant estimates used in the valuation of financial assets and liabilities for which quoted market prices and observable market parameters are not availablemunicipal and assetbacked securitiesthe municipal securities portion that is classified as level 3 uses significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the fair value is determined by utilizing thirdparty valuation services the thirdparty service provider reviews credit worthiness prevailing market rates analysis of similar securities and projected cash flows the thirdparty service provider also incorporates industry and general economic conditions into their analysis huntington evaluates the analysis provided for reasonablenessour private label cmo and cdo preferred securities portfolios are measured at fair value using a valuation methodology involving use of significant unobservable inputs and are thus classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy the private label cmo securities portfolio is subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows while the cash flows of our cdo preferred securities portfolio is reviewed quarterly these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties and are used as a basis for impairment analysisalta mortgagebacked and privatelabel cmo securities are collateralized by firstlien residential mortgage loans the securities valuation methodology incorporates values obtained from a thirdparty pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and a proprietary pricing model and includes assumptions management believes market participants would use to value the securities under current market conditions the model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds losses recoveries default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures house price depreciation  appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts and discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities with similar collateral structurescdo preferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio we engage a thirdparty pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooledtrustpreferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio the pd of each issuer and the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value management evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the thirdparty pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter actual defaults and deferrals in the current period and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with asc 820derivatives used for hedging purposesderivatives designated as qualified hedges are tested for hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis assessments are made at the inception of the hedge and on a recurring basis to determine whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item a statistical regression analysis is performed to measure the effectivenessif based on the assessment a derivative is not expected to be a highly effective hedge or it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge hedge accounting is discontinued as of the quarter the hedge is not highly effective as the statistical regression analysis requires the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are sensitive to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates we consider this a critical accounting estimateloans held for salehuntington has elected to apply the fair value option to certain residential mortgage loans that are classified as held for sale at origination the fair value of such loans is estimated based on the inputs that include prices of mortgage backed securities adjusted for other variables such as interest rates expected credit defaults and market discount rates the adjusted value reflects the price we expect to receive from the sale of such loanscertain consumer and commercial loans are classified as held for sale and are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value the determination of fair value for these consumer loans is based on observable prices for similar products or discounted expected cash flows which takes into consideration factors such as future interest rates prepayment speeds default and loss curves and market discount rates 92table of contentsmortgage servicing rightsretained rights to service mortgage loans are recognized as a separate and distinct asset at the time the loans are sold mortgage servicing rights msrs are initially recorded at fair value at the time the related loans are sold and subsequently remeasured at each reporting date under either the fair value or amortization method the election of the fair value or amortization method is made at the time each servicing asset is established all newly created msrs since 2009 are recorded using the amortization method any increase or decrease in fair value of msrs accounted for under the fair value method as well as any amortization andor impairment of msrs recorded under the amortization method is reflected in earnings in the period that the changes occur msrs are subject to interest rate risk in that their fair value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment fair value is determined based upon the application of an income approach valuation model we use an independent thirdparty valuation model which incorporates assumptions in estimating future cash flows these assumptions include prepayment speeds payoffs and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions the reasonableness of these pricing models is validated on a minimum of a quarterly basis by at least one independent external service broker valuation because the fair values of msrs are significantly impacted by the use of estimates the use of different assumptions can result in different estimated fair values of those msrscontingent liabilitieswe are a party to various claims litigation and legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current andor former operations we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a casebycase basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering among other factors the progress of each case or proceeding our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings and the opinions and views of legal counsel litigation exposure represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our controlincome taxesthe calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments we have two accruals for income taxes 1 our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal state and local taxing jurisdictions net of any reserve for potential audit issues and any tax refunds and the net receivable balance is reported as a component of accrued income and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 2 our deferred federal and state income tax and related valuation accounts reported as a component of accrued income and other assets represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under gaap and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under federal and state tax lawin the ordinary course of business we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes the effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws we believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements we review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions in addition we rely on various tax opinions recent tax audits and historical experiencefrom timetotime we engage in business transactions that may affect our tax liabilities where appropriate we obtain opinions of outside experts and assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking into account statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position however changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates implementation of new business strategies resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance such changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position andor results of operations see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statementsdeferred tax assetsat december 31 2015 we had a net federal deferred tax asset of 7 million and a net state deferred tax asset of 43 million a valuation allowance is provided when it is morelikelythannot some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized all available evidence both positive and negative was considered to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence impairment should be recognized our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change if our forecast of taxable income within the carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets such assets may be impaired based on our analysis of both positive and negative evidence and our ability to offset the net deferred tax assets against our forecasted future taxable income there was no impairment of the net deferred tax assets at december 31 2015 other than a valuation allowance relating to state net operating loss carryoversrecent accounting pronouncements and developments93table of contentsnote 2
