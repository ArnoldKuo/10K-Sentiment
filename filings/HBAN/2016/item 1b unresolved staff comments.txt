10table of contentsnondepository entities of a holding company on its subsidiary depository institutions the ratings assigned to us like those assigned to other financial institutions are confidential and may not be disclosed except to the extent required by lawunder the doddfrank act because we are a bank holding company with consolidated assets greater than 50 billion we are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards as a result we expect to be subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable to smaller institutions including with respect to capital requirements leverage limits and stress testing the federal reserve has issued supervisory guidance which sets forth an updated framework for the consolidated supervision of large financial institutions including bank holding companies with consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the objectives of the framework are to enhance the resilience of a firm lower the probability of its failure and reduce the impact on the financial system in the event of an institutions failure with regard to resiliency each firm is expected to ensure that the consolidated organization and its core business lines can survive under a broad range of internal or external stresses this requires financial resilience by maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity and operational resilience by maintaining effective corporate governance risk management and recovery planning with respect to lowering the probability of failure each firm is expected to ensure the sustainability of its critical operations and banking offices under a broad range of internal or external stresses this requires among other things that we have robust forwardlooking capitalplanning processes that account for our

management practices of certain large financial institutions including national banks with 50 billion or more in average total consolidated assets such as the bank the guidelines became effective november 10 2014 and require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risktaking activities in addition the guidelines provide standards for the institutions boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework given its size and the phased implementation schedule the bank is subject to these heightened standards effective may 2016 as discussed in item 1a risk factors the bank currently has a written governance framework and associated controlslegislative and regulatory reforms continue to have significant impacts throughout the financial services industrythe doddfrank act enacted in 2010 is complex and broad in scope and several of its provisions are still being implemented the doddfrank act established the cfpb which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services and the financial stability oversight council which has oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk in addition the doddfrank act altered the authority and duties of the federal banking and securities regulatory agencies implemented certain corporate governance requirements for all public companies including financial institutions with regard to executive compensation proxy access by shareholders and certain whistleblower provisions and restricted certain proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks and their affiliates the doddfrank act also required the issuance of numerous implementing regulations many of which have not yet been issued the regulations will continue to take effect over several more years continuing to make it difficult to anticipate the overall impact to us our customers or the financial industry in generalon october 3 2015 the cfpbs final rules on integrated mortgage disclosures under the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act became effective on january 1 2016 most requirements of the occs final rule in loans in areas having special flood hazards the flood final rule became effective including the requirement that flood insurance premiums and fees for most mortgage loans be escrowed subject to certain exceptions the flood final rule also incorporated other existing flood insurance requirements and exceptions eg the exemption from flood insurance requirements for nonresidential detached structures  a discretionary item with those portions of the flood final rule becoming effective on october 1 2015 we continue to monitor evaluate and implement these new regulationsthroughout 2015 the cfpb continued its focus on fair lending practices of indirect automobile lenders this focus led to some lenders to enter into consent orders with the cfpb and department of justice indirect automobile lenders have also received continued pressure from the cfpb to limit or eliminate discretionary pricing by dealers finally the cfpb has implemented its 11table of contentslarger participant rule for indirect automobile lending which brings larger nonbank indirect automobile lenders under cfpb supervisionbanking regulatory agencies have increasingly used their authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices udap by banks under standards developed many years ago by the federal trade commission in order to address practices that may not necessarily fall within the scope of a specific banking or consumer finance law the doddfrank act also gave to the cfpb similar authority to take action in connection with unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices udaap by entities subject to cfpb supervisory or enforcement authority banks face considerable uncertainty as to the regulatory interpretation of abusive practicesfinancial services companies face increased regulation and exposure under the new military lending act mla final rules issued by the department of defense that become effective for new loans entered into on and after october 3 2016 the new rules dramatically expand the scope of coverage of the mla and compliance with the new rules will affect operations of more financial services companies than under the previous rules on july 10 2015 the federal communication commission interpreting the telephone consumer protection act issued an omnibus declaratory ruling and order that among other things restricted the use of automated telephone dialing machines the ruling effectively increases the cost of collecting debts as well as increases the litigation risk associated with the use of autodialerslarge bank holding companies and national banks are required to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve and occ respectively and conduct stress teststhe federal reserves regulation y requires large bank holding companies to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and requires such bank holding companies to obtain approval from the federal reserve under certain circumstances before making a capital distribution this rule applies to us and all other bank holding companies with 50 billion or more of total consolidated assetsa large bank holding companys capital plan must include an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over at least the next nine quarters a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon a detailed description of the entitys process for assessing capital adequacy the entitys capital policy and a discussion of any expected changes to the bank holding companys business plan that are likely to have a material impact on the firms capital adequacy or liquidity the planning horizon for the most recently completed capital planning and stress testing cycle encompasses the 2014 fourth quarter through the 2016 fourth quarter as was submitted in our capital plan in january 2015 rules to implement the basel iii capital reforms in the united states were finalized in july 2013 and are being phasedin by us beginning with 1q 2015 results under the standardized approach capital adequacy at large banking organizations including us is assessed against a minimum 45 cet1 ratio and a 4 tier 1 leverage ratio as determined by the federal reservecapital plans for 2016 are required to be submitted to the federal reserve by april 5 2016 and the federal reserve will either object to the capital plan andor planned capital actions or provide a notice of nonobjection no later than june 30 2016 we intend to submit our capital plan to the federal reserve on or before april 5 2016 there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will respond favorably to our capital plan capital actions or stress test and the federal reserve occ or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including common stock dividends and stock repurchasesin addition to the ccar submission section 165 of the doddfrank act requires that national banks like the huntington national bank conduct annual stress tests for submission beginning in january 2015 the results of the stress tests will provide the occ with forwardlooking information that will be used in bank supervision and will assist the agency in assessing a companys risk profile and capital adequacy we submitted our stress test results to the occ in january 2015 we intend to submit our 2016 capital plan to the occ on or before april 5 2016 the regulatory capital rules indicate that common stockholders equity should be the dominant element within tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on noncommon equity elements under the doddfrank act the ratio of common equity tier 1 to riskweighted assets became significant as a measurement of the predominance of common equity in tier 1 capital and an indication of the quality of capital in accordance with their requirementsconforming covered activities to implement the volcker ruleon december 10 2013 the federal reserve the occ the fdic the cftc and the sec issued final rules to implement the volcker rule contained in section 619 of the doddfrank act and established july 21 2015 as the end of the conformance period section 619 generally prohibits an insured depository institution any company that controls an insured depository institution such 12table of contentsas a bank holding company and any of their subsidiaries and affiliates collectively banking entities from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining ownership interests in sponsoring or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund covered funds these prohibitions are subject to a number of statutory exemptions restrictions and definitions on december 18 2014 the federal reserve announced it acted under section 619 to give banking entities until july 21 2016 to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to december 31 2013 legacy covered funds the federal reserve also announced its intention to act this year to grant banking entities an additional oneyear extension of the conformance period until july 21 2017 to conform ownership interests in and relationships with legacy covered funds the bank continues its good faith efforts to conform with proprietary trading prohibitions and associated compliance requirements the company does not expect volcker compliance to have a material impact on its business modelthe volcker rules prohibitions impact the ability of us banking entities to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with nonus banking organizations in overseas markets the rule also effectively prohibits shortterm trading strategies by any us banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for tradingthe final volcker rule regulations do provide certain exemptions allowing banking entities to continue underwriting marketmaking and hedging activities and trading certain government obligations as well as various exemptions and exclusions from the definition of covered funds the level of required compliance activity depends on the size of the banking entity and the extent of its trading ceos of larger banking entities including huntington have to attest annually in writing that their organization has in place processes to establish maintain enforce review test and modify compliance with the volcker rule regulations banking entities with significant permitted trading operations will have to report certain quantitative information beginning between june

entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of the volcker rule under the interim final rule the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities if certain qualifications are met in addition the agencies released a nonexclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of the interim final rule at december 31 2015 we had investments in eight different pools of trust preferred securities seven of our pools are included in the list of nonexclusive issuers we have analyzed the other pool that was not included on the list and believe that we will continue to be able to own this investment under the final volcker rule regulationsthere are restrictions on our ability to pay dividendsdividends from the bank to the parent company are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders however there are statutory limits on the amount of dividends that the bank can pay to the holding company regulatory approval is required prior to the declaration of any dividends in an amount greater than its undivided profits or if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus or common stock the bank is currently able to pay dividends to the holding company subject to these limitationsif in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice such authority may require after notice and hearing that such bank cease and desist from such practice depending on the financial condition of the bank the applicable regulatory authority might deem us to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice if the bank were to pay dividends to the holding companythe federal reserve and the occ have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings additionally the federal reserve may prohibit or limit bank holding companies from making capital distributions including payment of preferred and common dividends as part of the annual capital plan approval processwe are subject to the current capital requirements mandated by the federal reserve and basel iii capital and liquidity frameworksthe federal reserve sets riskbased capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies under the guidelines and related policies bank holding companies must maintain capital sufficient to meet both a riskbased asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis the riskbased ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet commitments into riskweighted categories with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived as representing greater risk the riskbased ratio represents total capital divided by total riskweighted assets the leverage ratio is core capital divided by total assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines the bank is subject to substantially similar capital requirements13table of contentsin 2013 the federal reserve and the occ adopted final capital rules implementing basel iii requirements for us banking organizations the final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and implement in the united states the basel iii regulatory capital reforms from the basel committee on banking supervision and certain changes required by the doddfrank act under the final rule minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations consistent with the international basel framework the final rule includes a new minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and a capital conservation buffer of 25 of riskweighted assets that will apply to all supervised financial institutions the rule also raises the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4 these new minimum capital ratios were effective for us on january 1 2015 and will be fully phasedin on january 1 2019the following are

generally based on supervisory risk weightings that vary only by counterparty type and asset class the revisions to supervisory risk weightings for basel iii enhance risk sensitivity and include

commercial loans msrs and certain unfunded commitments basel iii also prescribes a new formulaic approach for calculating the risk weight of securitization exposures that is also more risk sensitivefailure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the financial institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities these include limitations on the ability to pay dividends the issuance by the regulatory authority of a directive to increase capital and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic in addition the financial institution could be subject to the measures described below under prompt corrective action as applicable to undercapitalized institutionsthe riskbased capital standards of the federal reserve the occ and the fdic specify that evaluations by the banking agencies of a banks capital adequacy will include an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of a banks capital due to changes in interest rates these banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active oversight of risk management activities by senior management14table of contentsfdicia requires federal banking regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect

including payment of a cash dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would become undercapitalized after such payment undercapitalized institutions are also subject to growth limitations and are required by the appropriate federal banking agency to submit a capital restoration plan if any depository institution subsidiary of a holding company is required to submit a capital restoration plan the holding company would be required to provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of such plandepending upon the severity of the under capitalization the undercapitalized institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequatelycapitalized requirements to reduce total assets cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks and restrictions on making any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming so classifiedunder fdicia a wellcapitalized bank may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval a depository institution that is not wellcapitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market since the bank is wellcapitalized the fdicia brokered deposit rule did not adversely affect its ability to accept brokered deposits the bank had 29 billion of such brokered deposits at december 31 2015on september 3 2014 the us banking regulators approved a final rule to implement the us version of the basel committees minimum liquidity coverage ratio lcr requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more and a less stringent modified lcr requirement to depository institution holding companies below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the lcr requires covered banking organizations to maintain an amount of unencumbered hqla equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendarday stress scenario we are covered by the modified lcr requirement and therefore subject to the initial phasein of the rule beginning in january 2016 with the requirement fully phasedin january 2017 we will also be required to calculate the lcr monthly the modified lcr is a minimum requirement and the federal reserve can impose additional liquidity requirements as a supervisory matterwe are required to submit annual resolution plansas a bank holding company with greater than 50 billion of assets we are required annually to submit to the federal reserve and the fdic a resolution plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the company in the event of material financial distress or failure if both the federal reserve and the fdic determine that our plan is not credible and the deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner the federal reserve and the fdic may jointly impose on us more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth activities or operations15table of contentsthe fdic separately has adopted a final rule requiring an insured depository institution with 50 billion or more in total assets such as the bank to submit periodically to the fdic a resolution plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure the fdic rule requires each covered institution to provide a resolution plan that should enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the institution in an orderly manner that enables prompt access of insured deposits maximizes the return from the failed institutions assets and minimizes losses realized by creditors and the deposit insurance fund we filed our resolution plans pursuant to each rule in december 2015as a bank holding company we must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the bankunder the doddfrank act a bank holding company must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and must commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank the federal reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank it may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the federal reserve believes might jeopardize the bank holding companys ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bankany loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy an appointed bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank moreover the bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institutions general unsecured creditors including the holders of its note obligationsfederal law permits the occ to order the prorata assessment of shareholders of a national bank whose capital stock has become impaired by losses or otherwise to relieve a deficiency in such national banks capital stock this statute also provides for the enforcement of any such prorata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of capital stock by sale to the extent necessary of the capital stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to pay the assessment as the sole

banktransactions between the bank and its affiliates are restrictedfederal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the banks bank holding company and certain companies the bank holding company may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on armslength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the banks regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bank holding company may be required to provide itprovisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of i the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment advisor ii credit

include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and iii transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction they also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july 21 2012 the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement themas a financial holding company we are subject to additional laws and regulationsas a financial holding company we are permitted to engage in and affiliate with financial companies engaging in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company in order to maintain our status as a financial holding company we and the bank must each remain wellcapitalized and wellmanaged in addition the bank must receive 16table of contentsa community reinvestment act cra rating of at least satisfactory at its most recent examination for us to engage in the full range of activities permissible for financial holding companies pursuant to cra the occ examines the bank to assess the banks record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank and assigns a rating based on that assessment the cra assessment and rating is reviewed by the federal reserve in evaluating a variety of applications including to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of other institutions or to open or relocate a branch officefinancial holding company powers relate to financial activities that are specified in the bank holding company act or determined by the federal reserve in coordination with the secretary of the treasury to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity provided that the complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness risk in addition we are required by the bank holding company act to obtain federal reserve approval prior to acquiring directly or indirectly ownership or control of voting shares of any bank if after such acquisition we would own or control more than 5 of its voting stock furthermore the doddfrank act added a new provision to the bank holding company act which requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than 50 billion to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve to acquire a nondepository company having total consolidated assets of 10 billion or morewe also must comply with antimoney laundering and customer privacy regulations as well as corporate governance accounting and reporting requirementsthe usa patriot act of 2001 and its related regulations require insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing federal banking regulators are required when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering activities of the applicants the financial crimes enforcement network has proposed a rule for those same entities and if adopted the proposal will prescribe customer due diligence requirements including a new regulatory mandate to identify the beneficial owners of legal entities which are customerspursuant to title v of the grammleachbliley act we like all other financial institutions are required

effectiveness of internal controls over financial reportingthe federal reserve jointly with the occ and fdic has issued guidance to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at financial institutions take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices in addition the federal financial regulators issued a proposed rule in april 2011 pursuant to the doddfrank act to adopt standards for determining whether an incentivebased compensation arrangement may encourage inappropriate risktaking that are consistent with the key principles established for incentive compensation in the guidance the proposed rule would apply to financial institutions with 1 billion or more in assets with heightened standards for financial institutions with 50 billion or more in

aggregate moderatetolow this does not preclude engagement in select higher risk activities rather the definition is intended to represent an aggregate view of where we want our overall risk to be managedthree board committees primarily oversee implementation of this desired risk appetite and monitoring of our risk profile the audit committee oversees the integrity of the consolidated financial statements including policies procedures and practices regarding the preparation of financial statements the financial reporting process disclosures and internal control over financial reporting the audit committee also provides assistance to the board in overseeing the internal audit division and the independent registered public accounting firms qualifications and independence compliance with our financial code of ethics for the chief executive officer and senior financial officers and compliance with corporate securities trading policiesthe risk oversight committee assists the board of directors in overseeing management of material risks the approval and monitoring of the companys capital position and plan supporting our overall aggregate moderatetolow risk profile the risk governance structure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and determining adherence to the boards stated risk appetite the committee has oversight responsibility with respect to the full range of inherent risks market credit liquidity legal complianceregulatory operational strategic and reputational this committee also oversees our capital management and planning process ensures that the amount and quality of capital are adequate in relation to expected and unexpected risks and that our capital levels exceed wellcapitalized requirements the technology committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to all technology cyber security and thirdparty risk management strategies and plans the committee is charged with evaluating huntingtons capability to properly perform all technology functions necessary for its business plan including projected growth technology capacity planning operational execution product development and management capacity the committee provides oversight of the technology segment investments and plans to drive efficiency as well as to meet defined standards for risk security and redundancy the committee oversees the allocation of technology costs and ensures that they are understood by the board of directors the technology committee monitors and evaluates innovation and technology trends that may affect the companys strategic plans including monitoring of overall industry trends the technology committee reviews and provides oversight of the companys continuity and disaster recovery planning and preparednessthe audit and risk oversight committees routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and risk management on a periodic basis the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both such as the construct and appropriateness of the acl which is reviewed quarterly all directors have access to information provided to each committee and all scheduled meetings are open to all directorsfurther through its compensation committee the board of directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards is risksensitive and aligns the interests of management creditors and shareholders we utilize a variety of compensationrelated tools to induce appropriate behavior including common stock ownership thresholds for the chief executive officer and certain members of senior management a requirement to hold until retirement or exit from the company a portion of net shares received upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards 50 for executive officers and 25 for other award recipients equity deferrals recoupment provisions and the right to terminate compensation plans at any timemanagement has implemented an enterprise risk management and risk appetite framework critically important is our selfassessment process in which each business segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls the segment analyses are combined with assessments by our risk management organization of major risk sectors eg credit market liquidity operational legal compliance reputational and strategic to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment outcomes of the process include a determination of the quality of the overall control process the direction of risk and our position compared to the defined risk appetitemanagement also utilizes a wide series of metrics key risk indicators to monitor risk positions throughout the company in general a range for each metric is established which allows the company in aggregate to operate within an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile deviations from the range will indicate if the risk being measured exceeds desired tolerance which may then necessitate corrective actionwe also have four executive level committees to manage risk alco credit policy and strategy risk management and capital management each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature we believe this structure helps ensure appropriate escalation of issues and overall communication of strategies18table of contentshuntington utilizes three lines of defense with regard to risk management 1 business segments 2 corporate risk management and 3 internal audit and credit review to induce greater ownership of risk within its business segments segment risk officers have been embedded to identify and monitor risk elevate and remediate issues establish controls perform selftesting and oversee the selfassessment process corporate risk management establishes policies sets operating limits reviews new or modified productsprocesses ensures consistency and quality assurance within the segments and produces the enterprise risk assessment the chief risk officer has significant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans as they apply to risk internal audit and credit review provide additional assurance that riskrelated functions are operating as intendedrisk overviewwe like other financial companies are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations many of which are outside of our direct control though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns among the risks assumed are credit risk which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms market risk which occurs when fluctuations in interest rates impact earnings and capital financial impacts are realized through changes in the interest rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities net interest margin or directly through valuation changes of capitalized msr andor trading assets noninterest income liquidity risk which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels liquidity risk also results from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the banks ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value operational and legal risk which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems human errors or misconduct or adverse external events operational losses result from internal fraud external fraud inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety failure to meet professional obligations involving customers products and business practices damage to physical assets business disruption and systems failures and failures in execution delivery and process management legal risk includes but is not limited to exposure to orders fines penalties or punitive damages resulting from litigation as well as regulatory actions and compliance risk which exposes us to money penalties enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws rules and regulations that apply to the financial services industrywe also expend considerable effort to contain risk which emanates from execution of our business processes and strategies and work relentlessly to protect the companys reputation strategic risk and reputational risk do not easily lend themselves to traditional methods of measurement rather we closely monitor them through processes such as new product  initiative reviews frequent financial performance reviews colleague and client surveys monitoring market intelligence periodic discussions between management and our board and other such effortsin addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report readers should carefully consider that the following important factors among others could negatively impact our business future results of operations and future cash flows materiallycredit risks1 our acl level may prove to be inappropriate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could materially adversely affect our net income and capitalour business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers our acl of 670 million at december 31 2015 represented managements estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we periodically review our acl for appropriateness in doing so we consider economic conditions and trends collateral values and credit quality indicators such as past chargeoff experience levels of past due loans and npas there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases if the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsin addition regulatory review of risk ratings and loan and lease losses may impact the level of the acl and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations19table of contents2 weakness in economic conditions could materially adversely affect our businessour performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us our customers and our counterparties these conditions could result in one or more of the followinga decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by usa decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us andan increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to usan increase in the number of delinquencies bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of npas ncos provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale the markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and thus are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectorsmarket risks1 changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income reduce transactional income and negatively impact the value of our loans securities and other assets this could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows financial condition results of operations and capitalour results of operations depend substantially on net interest income which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions conditions such as inflation deflation recession unemployment money supply and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates if our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment net interest income could be materially adversely impacted likewise if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment net interest income could be adversely impacted the continuation of the current low interest rate environment or a deflationary environment with negative interest rates could affect consumer and business behavior in ways that are adverse to us and could also constrict our net interest income margin which may restrict our ability to increase net interest incomechanges in interest rates can affect the value of loans securities assets under management and other assets including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights an increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in npas and a reduction of income recognized which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows when we place a loan on nonaccrual status we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable which decreases interest income however we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding nals without any corresponding interest income in addition transactional income including trust income brokerage income and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from periodtoperiod based on a number of factors including the interest rate environment a decline in interest rates along with a flattening yield curve limits our ability to reprice deposits given the current historically low level of interest rates and could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixedrate securities and cash flow hedging derivatives portfolio any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts oci shareholders equity and the tangible common equity ratio any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios in a rising interest rate environment pension and other postretirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative oci impacts from securities and financial instruments for more information refer to market risk of the mdampacertain investment securities notably mortgagebacked securities are very sensitive to rising and falling rates generally when rates rise prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will increase conversely when rates fall prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will decrease in either case interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgagebacked securitiesthe value of our msr asset is also a function of changes in interest rates and prepayment expectations declining interest rates primarily in the longer end of the yield curve reduces the value of the msr asset in addition to volatility associated with interest rates the company also has exposure to equity markets related to the investments within the benefit plans and other income from client based transactions 20table of contents2 industry competition may have an adverse effect on our successour profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully we operate in a highly competitive environment and we expect competition to intensify due in part to the sustained low interest rate and ongoing lowgrowth economic environment certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits in our market areas we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and therefore may have greater flexibility in competing for business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including customer convenience quality of service by investing in new products and services personal contacts pricing and range of products if we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in particular if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability or a desire to do business with our competitors we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin for more information refer to competition section of item 1 businessliquidity risks1 changes in either huntingtons financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidenceliquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost the bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers the board of directors establishes liquidity policies and limits and management establishes operating guidelines for liquidityour primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers the continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular the availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes eg changes in fdic insurance the liquidity coverage ratio etc and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits while we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding market related geopolitical or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits2 if we lose access to capital markets we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors creditors and borrowers or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activitieswholesale

and in some instances customers were prevented from accessing our website we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future while events to date primarily resulted in inconvenience future cyberattacks could be more disruptive and damaging hacking and identity theft risks in particular could cause serious reputational harm cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss21table of contentsdespite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems we may not be able to

bankruptcy of cyberco holdings inc 3 we face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and capital marketswe are exposed to many types of operational risks including the risk of fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders unauthorized transactions by colleagues or outsiders operational errors by colleagues business disruption and system failures huntington executes against a significant number of controls a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and thirdparty service providers there is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack these operational risks could lead to financial loss expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and the capital marketsmoreover negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including clients products and business practices corporate governance acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory actionrelative to acquisitions we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions including our pending acquisition of firstmerit corporation acquisitions may be subject to and our pending acquisition of firstmerit corporation is subject to the receipt of approvals from certain governmental authorities including the federal reserve the occ and the united states department of justice as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire these approvals for acquisitions may not be received may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions subject to requisite regulatory approvals future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock which would dilute current shareholders ownership interests additionally acquisitions may also involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction 22table of contents4 failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock priceeffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud as a financial holding company we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures such controls and procedures are modified supplemented and changed from timetotime as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments any failure to maintain in the future an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis which could result in regulatory actions loss of investor confidence and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price5 we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial valuesquantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including estimating probable loan losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk and for capital planning purposes including during the ccar capital planning and capital adequacy process our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses particularly in times of market distress and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code bad data misuse of data or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the models designall models have certain limitations reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect missing or misleading information in addition our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable also information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleadingbanking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate including distributions to our shareholders could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient6 we rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure we rely on thirdparty service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice provide enhanced products and services and reduce costs although there are benefits in entering into thirdparty relationships with vendors and others there are risks associated with such activities when entering a thirdparty relationship the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the thirdparty but remain our responsibility the technology committee of the board of directors provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with thirdparty relationships management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing thirdparty relationships management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships increased risk could occur based on poor planning oversight and control and inferior performance or service on the part of the thirdparty and may result in legal costs or loss of business while we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of thirdparty service providers any problems caused by thirdparty service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business replacing a thirdparty service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses7 changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operationsthe fasb regulatory agencies and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements additionally those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations the fasb is currently close to issuing several new accounting standards that will have significant impacts on the banking industry most notably new guidance on the calculation of credit reserves using expected losses current expected credit losses versus incurred losses is close to being finalized and upon implementation could 23table of contentssignificantly impact our required credit reserves other impacts to capital levels profit and loss and various financial metrics will also resultcompliance risks1 bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity including the annual ccar assessment process and the basel iii capital and liquidity standards could require higher levels of capital and liquidity among other things these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends repurchase common stock attract costeffective sources of deposits or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securitiesthe federal reserve administers the annual ccar an assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies with consolidated assets of 50 billion or more and of the practices used by covered banks to assess capital needs under ccar the federal reserve makes a qualitative assessment of capital adequacy on a forwardlooking basis and reviews the strength of a bank holding companys capital adequacy process the federal reserve also makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisoryrun stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a cet1 ratio of 45 after making all capital actions included in a bank holding companys capital plan under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a ninequarter planning horizon capital plans for 2016 are required to be submitted by april 5 2016 and the federal reserve will either object to the capital plan andor planned capital actions or provide a notice of nonobjection no later than june 30 2016 we intend to submit our capital plan to the federal reserve on or before april 5 2016 the bank also must submit a capital plan to the occ on or before april 5 2016 there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will respond favorably to our capital plan capital actions or stress test and the federal reserve occ or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including common stock dividends and stock repurchasesin 2013 the federal reserve and the occ adopted final rules to implement the basel iii capital rules for us banking organizations the final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the united states the basel iii regulatory capital reforms from the basel committee on banking supervision and certain changes required by the doddfrank act under the final rule minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations as a standardized approach institution the basel iii minimum capital requirements became effective for us on january 1 2015 and will be fully phasedin on january 1 2019on september 3 2014 the us banking regulators approved a final rule to implement a minimum liquidity coverage ratio lcr requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more and a less stringent modified lcr requirement to depository institution holding companies below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the lcr requires covered banking organizations to maintain hqla equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendarday stress scenario we are covered by the modified lcr requirement and therefore subject to the phasein of the rule beginning january 2016 at 90 and january 2017 at 100 we will also be required to calculate the lcr monthly the lcr assigns less severe outflow assumptions to certain types of customer deposits which should increase the demand and perhaps the cost among banks for these deposits additionally the hqla requirements will increase the demand for direct us government and us government guaranteed debt that while high quality generally carry lower yields than other securities that banks hold in their investment portfolios2 if our regulators deem it appropriate they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results ability to compete for new business or preclude mergers or acquisitions in addition regulatory actions could constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends any of these actions could increase the cost of our services we are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators including the occ federal reserve fdic sec cfpb financial industry regulatory authority and various state regulatory agencies as such we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations many of which are discussed in the regulatory matters section as part of their supervisory process which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways including charging monetary fines impacting our ability to pay dividends precluding mergers or acquisitions limiting our ability to offer certain products or services or imposing additional capital requirementswith the addition of the cfpb our consumer products and services are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations we may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations enforcement actions and litigation in the future related to consumer practices thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions in addition increased regulatory inquiries and investigations as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses and any required changes to our

implement many new and significant rules and regulations it is not possible to predict the full extent to which the doddfrank act or the resulting rules and regulations in their entirety will impact our business compliance with these new laws and regulations have and will continue to result in additional costs which could be significant and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations in addition if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to our consumer operations we may be subject to fines penalties or judgments or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses which could adversely affect operations and in turn financial results4 we may become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and activity restrictions if the federal reserve and fdic determine that our resolution plan is not credible the doddfrank act and implementing regulations jointly issued by federal reserve and the fdic require bank holding companies with more than 50 billion in assets to annually submit a resolution plan to the federal reserve and the fdic that in the event of material financial distress or failure
