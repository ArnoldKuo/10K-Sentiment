included in accrued income and other assets and huntingtons proportional interest in the equity investments earnings are included in other noninterest income investment interests accounted for under the cost and equity methods are periodically evaluated for impairmentthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that significantly affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements huntington utilizes processes that involve the use of significant estimates and the judgments of management in determining the amount of its allowance for credit losses income taxes deferred tax assets and contingent liabilities as well as fair value measurements of investment securities derivatives goodwill pension assets and liabilities shortterm borrowings mortgage servicing rights and loans held for sale as with any estimate actual results could differ from those estimates for statement of cash flows purposes cash and cash equivalents are defined as the sum of cash and due from banks which includes amounts on deposit with the federal reserve and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreementscertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentationresale and repurchase agreements  securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest the fair value of collateral either received from or provided to a thirdparty is continually monitored and additional collateral is obtained or requested to be returned to huntington in accordance with the agreementsecurities  securities purchased with the intention of recognizing shortterm profits or which are actively bought and sold are classified as trading account securities and reported at fair value the unrealized gains or losses on trading account securities are recorded in other noninterest income except for gains and losses on trading account securities used to hedge the fair value of msrs which are included in mortgage banking income debt securities purchased in which huntington has the positive intent and ability to hold to their maturity are classified as heldtomaturity securities heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost all other debt and equity securities are classified as availableforsale and other securities unrealized gains or losses on availableforsale and other securities are reported as a separate component of accumulated oci in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders equity creditrelated declines in the value of debt securities that are considered otherthantemporary are recorded in noninterest incomehuntington evaluates its investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis for indicators of otti huntington assesses whether otti has occurred when the fair value of a debt security is less than the amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date management reviews the amount of unrealized loss the length of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position the credit rating history market trends of similar security classes time remaining to maturity and the source of both interest and principal payments to identify securities which could potentially be impaired otti is considered to have occurred 1 if huntington intends to sell the security 2 if it is more likely than not huntington will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 the present value of expected cash flows are not sufficient to recover all contractually required principal and interest payments for securities that huntington does not expect to sell or it is not more likely than not to be required to sell the otti is separated into credit and noncredit components a discounted cash flow analysis which includes evaluating the timing of the expected cash flows is completed for all debt securities subject to credit impairment the measurement of the credit loss component is equal to the difference between the debt securitys cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows discounted at the securitys effective yield the creditrelated otti represented by the expected loss in principal is recognized in noninterest income the remaining difference between the securitys fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not creditrelated and therefore are recognized in oci huntington believes that it will fully collect the carrying value of securities on which noncreditrelated otti has been recognized in oci noncreditrelated otti results from other factors including increased liquidity spreads and extension of the security for securities which huntington does expect to sell or if it is more likely than not huntington will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis all otti is recognized in earnings presentation of otti is made in the consolidated statements of income on a gross basis with a reduction for the amount of otti recognized in oci securities transactions are recognized on the trade date the date the order to buy or sell is executed the carrying value plus any related accumulated oci balance of sold securities is used to compute realized gains and losses interest and dividends on securities including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the effective interest method over the period to maturity are included in interest incomenonmarketable equity securities include stock acquired for regulatory purposes such as federal home loan bank stock and federal reserve bank stock these securities are accounted for at cost evaluated for impairment and included in availableforsale and other securities loans and leases  loans and direct financing leases for which huntington has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as loans and leases except for loans for which the fair value option has been elected loans and leases are carried at the principal amount outstanding net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs and net of unearned income direct financing leases are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values net of unearned and deferred income interest income is accrued as earned using the interest method based on unpaid principal balances huntington defers the fees it receives from the origination of loans and leases as well as the direct costs of those activities huntington also acquires loans at a premium and at a discount to their contractual values huntington amortizes loan discounts premiums and net loan origination fees and costs on a levelyield basis over the estimated lives of the related loans which would not include purchased credit impaired loanstroubled debt restructurings are loans for which the original contractual terms have been modified to provide a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties loan modifications are considered tdrs when the concessions provided are not available to the borrower through either normal channels or other sources however not all loan modifications are tdrs modifications resulting in troubled debt restructurings may include changes to one or more terms of the loan including but not limited to a change in interest rate an extension of the amortization period a reduction in payment amount and partial forgiveness or deferment of principal or accrued interestresidual values on leased equipment are evaluated quarterly for impairment impairment of the residual values of direct financing leases determined to be other than temporary is recognized by writing the leases down to fair value with a charge to other noninterest expense residual value losses arise if the expected fair value at the end of the lease term is less than the residual value recorded at the lease origination net of estimated amounts reimbursable by the lessee future declines in the expected residual value of the leased equipment would result in expected losses of the leased equipmentfor leased equipment the residual component of a direct financing lease represents the estimated fair value of the leased equipment at the end of the lease term huntington uses industry data historical experience and independent appraisals to establish these residual value estimates additional information regarding product life cycle product upgrades as well as insight into competing products are obtained through relationships with industry contacts and are factored into residual value estimates where applicableloans held for sale  loans in which huntington does not have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as loans held for sale loans held for sale excluding loans originated or acquired with the intent to sell which are carried at fair value are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell the fair value option is generally elected for mortgage loans held for sale to facilitate hedging of the loans the fair value of such loans is estimated based on the inputs that include prices of mortgage backed securities adjusted for other variables such as interest rates expected credit defaults and market discount rates the adjusted value reflects the price we expect to receive from the sale of such loansnonmortgage loans held for sale are measured on an aggregate asset basis106table of contentsallowance for credit losses  huntington maintains two reserves both of which reflect managements judgment regarding the appropriate level necessary to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the alll and the aulc combined these reserves comprise the total acl the determination of the acl requires significant estimates including the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and leases consideration of current economic conditions and historical loss experience pertaining to pools of homogeneous loans and leases all of which may be susceptible to changethe appropriateness of the acl is based on managements current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio these judgments consider ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support further management evaluates the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above additional factors also considered include the impact of increasing or decreasing residential real estate values the diversification of cre loans the development of new or expanded commercial business segments such as healthcare abl leveraged lending and energy and the overall condition of the manufacturing industry also the acl assessment includes the ongoing assessment of credit quality metrics and a comparison of certain acl benchmarks to current performance the alll consists of two components 1 the transaction reserve which includes a loan level allocation specific reserves related to loans considered to be impaired and loans involved in troubled debt restructurings and 2 the general reserve the transaction reserve component includes both 1 an estimate of loss based on pools of commercial and consumer loans and leases with similar characteristics and 2 an estimate of loss based on an impairment review of each impaired campi and cre loan where obligor balance is greater than 10 million for the campi and cre portfolios the estimate of loss based on pools of loans and leases with similar characteristics is made by applying a pd factor and a lgd factor to each individual loan based on a regularly updated loan grade using a standardized loan grading system the pd factor and an lgd factor are determined for each loan grade using statistical models based on historical performance data the pd factor considers ongoing reviews of the financial performance of the specific borrower including cash flow debtservice coverage ratio earnings power debt level and equity position in conjunction with an assessment of the borrowers industry and future prospects the lgd factor considers analysis of the type of collateral and the relative ltv ratio these reserve factors are developed based on credit migration models that track historical movements of loans between loan ratings over time and a combination of longterm average loss experience of our own portfolio and external industry datain the case of more homogeneous portfolios such as automobile loans home equity loans and residential mortgage loans the determination of the transaction reserve also incorporates pd and lgd factors the estimate of loss is based on pools of loans and leases with similar characteristics the pd factor considers current credit scores unless the account is delinquent in which case a higher pd factor is used the credit score provides a basis for understanding the borrowers past and current payment performance and this information is used to estimate expected losses over the emergence period the performance of firstlien loans ahead of our juniorlien loans is available to use as part of our updated score process the lgd factor considers analysis of the type of collateral and the relative ltv ratio credit scores models analyses and other factors used to determine both the pd and lgd factors are updated frequently to capture the recent behavioral characteristics of the subject portfolios as well as any changes in loss mitigation or credit origination strategies and adjustments to the reserve factors are made as required the general reserve consists of various riskprofile reserve components the riskprofile component considers items unique to our structure policies processes and portfolio composition as well as qualitative measurements and assessments of the loan portfolios including but not limited to management quality concentrations portfolio composition industry comparisons and internal review functionsthe estimate for the aulc is determined using the same procedures and methodologies as used for the alll the loss factors used in the aulc are the same as the loss factors used in the alll while also considering a historical utilization of unused commitments the aulc is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheetsnonaccrual and past due loans  loans are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due dateany loan in any portfolio may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to the policies described below when collection of principal or interest is in doubt when a borrower with debt is discharged in a chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower the loan is determined to be collateral dependent and placed on nonaccrual status unless there is a coborrowerall classes within the campi and cre portfolios except for purchased creditimpaired loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 90days past due firstlien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 150days past due juniorlien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of 120days past due or when the related firstlien loan has been identified as nonaccrual automobile and other consumer loans are generally chargedoff when the loan is 120days past due residential mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 150days past due with the exception of residential mortgages guaranteed by government agencies 107table of contentswhich continue to accrue interest at the rate guaranteed by the government agency we are reimbursed from the government agency for reasonable expenses incurred in servicing loans for all classes within all loan portfolios when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status any accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to interest income and prior year amounts chargedoff as a credit lossfor all classes within all loan portfolios cash receipts received on nals are applied against principal until the loan or lease has been collected in full after which time any additional cash receipts are recognized as interest income however for secured nonreaffirmed debt in a chapter 7 bankruptcy payments are applied to principal and interest when the borrower has demonstrated a capacity to continue payment of the debt and collection of the debt is reasonably assured for unsecured nonreaffirmed debt in a chapter 7 bankruptcy where the carrying value has been fully chargedoff payments are recorded as loan recoveriesregarding all classes within the campi and cre portfolios the determination of a borrowers ability to make the required principal and interest payments is based on an examination of the borrowers current financial statements industry management capabilities and other qualitative measures for all classes within the consumer loan portfolio the determination of a borrowers ability to make the required principal and interest payments is based on multiple factors including number of days past due and in some instances an evaluation of the borrowers financial condition when in managements judgment the borrowers ability to make required principal and interest payments resumes and collectability is no longer in doubt supported by sustained repayment history the loan is returned to accrual status for these loans that have been returned to accrual status cash receipts are applied according to the contractual terms of the loanchargeoff of uncollectible loans  any loan in any portfolio may be chargedoff prior to the policies described below if a loss confirming event has occurred loss confirming events include but are not limited to bankruptcy unsecured continued delinquency foreclosure or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency and that asset is the sole source of repayment additionally discharged collateral dependent nonreaffirmed debt in chapter 7 bankruptcy filings will result in a chargeoff to estimated collateral value less anticipated selling costscampi and cre loans are either chargedoff or written down to net realizable value at 90days past due automobile loans and other consumer loans are chargedoff at 120days past due firstlien and juniorlien home equity loans are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs at 150days past due and 120days past due respectively residential mortgages are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the collateral at 150days past dueimpaired loans  for all classes within the campi and cre portfolios all loans with an obligor balance of 10 million or greater are evaluated on a quarterly basis for impairment except for tdrs consumer loans within any class are generally not individually evaluated on a regular basis for impairment all tdrs regardless of the outstanding balance amount are also considered to be impaired loans acquired with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable at acquisition that all contractually required payments will not be collected are also considered to be impairedonce a loan has been identified for an assessment of impairment the loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected this determination requires significant judgment and use of estimates and the eventual outcome may differ significantly from those estimateswhen a loan in any class has been determined to be impaired the amount of the impairment is measured using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or as a practical expedient the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent when the present value of expected future cash flows is used the effective interest rate is the original contractual interest rate of the loan adjusted for any cost fee premium or discount when the contractual interest rate is variable the effective interest rate of the loan changes over time a specific reserve is established as a component of the alll when a loan has been determined to be impaired subsequent to the initial measurement of impairment if there is a significant change to the impaired loans expected future cash flows or if actual cash flows are significantly different from the cash flows previously estimated huntington recalculates the impairment and appropriately adjusts the specific reserve similarly if huntington measures impairment based on the observable market price of an impaired loan or the fair value of the collateral of an impaired collateral dependent loan huntington will adjust the specific reservewhen a loan within any class is impaired the accrual of interest income is discontinued unless the receipt of principal and interest is no longer in doubt interest income on tdrs is accrued when all principal and interest is expected to be collected under the postmodification terms cash receipts received on nonaccruing impaired loans within any class are generally applied entirely against principal until the loan has been collected in full including already chargedoff portion after which time any additional cash receipts are recognized as interest income cash receipts received on accruing impaired loans within any class are applied in the same manner as accruing loans that are not considered impaired108table of contentspurchased creditimpaired loans  purchased loans with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable at acquisition that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are considered to be credit impaired purchased creditimpaired loans are initially recorded at fair value which is estimated by discounting the cash flows expected to be collected at the acquisition date because the estimate of expected cash flows reflects an estimate of future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loans an allowance for credit losses is not recorded at the acquisition date the excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value referred to as the accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans on a levelyield basis the difference between the contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference a subsequent decrease in the estimate of cash flows expected to be received on purchased creditimpaired loans generally results in the recognition of an allowance for credit losses subsequent increases in cash flows result in reversal of any nonaccretable difference or allowance for loan and lease losses to the extent any has been recorded with a positive impact on interest income subsequently recognized the measurement of cash flows involves assumptions and judgments for interest rates prepayments default rates loss severity and collateral values all of these factors are inherently subjective and significant changes in the cash flow estimates over the life of the loan can resulttransfers of financial assets and securitizations  transfers of financial assets in which we have surrendered control over the transferred assets are accounted for as sales in assessing whether control has been surrendered we consider whether the transferee would be a consolidated affiliate the existence and extent of any continuing involvement in the transferred financial assets and the impact of all arrangements or agreements made contemporaneously with or in contemplation of the transfer even if they were not entered into at the time of transfer control is generally considered to have been surrendered when i the transferred assets have been legally isolated from us or any of our consolidated affiliates even in bankruptcy or other receivership ii the transferee or if the transferee is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization or assetbacked financing that is constrained from pledging or exchanging the assets it receives each thirdparty holder of its beneficial interests has the right to pledge or exchange the assets or beneficial interests it received without any constraints that provide more than a trivial benefit to us and iii neither we nor our consolidated affiliates and agents have a both the right and obligation under any agreement to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets before their maturity b the unilateral ability to cause the holder to return specific financial assets that also provides us with a morethantrivial benefit other than through a cleanup call or c an agreement that permits the transferee to require us to repurchase the transferred assets at a price so favorable that it is probable that it will require us to repurchase themif the sale criteria are met the transferred financial assets are removed from our balance sheet and a gain or loss on sale is recognized if the sale criteria are not met the transfer is recorded as a secured borrowing in which the assets remain on our balance sheet and the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a liability for the majority of financial asset transfers it is clear whether or not we have surrendered control for other transfers such as in connection with complex transactions or where we have continuing involvement we generally obtain a legal opinion as to whether the transfer results in a true sale by lawwe have historically securitized certain automobile receivables gains and losses on the loans and leases sold and servicing rights associated with loan and lease sales are determined when the related loans or leases are sold to either a securitization trust or thirdparty for loan or lease sales with servicing retained a servicing asset is recorded at fair value for the right to service the loans soldderivative financial instruments  a variety of derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps caps floors and collars are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements these instruments provide flexibility in adjusting huntingtons sensitivity to changes in interest rates without exposure to loss of principal and higher funding requirementshuntington also uses derivatives principally loan sale commitments in hedging its mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and its mortgage loans held for sale mortgage loan sale commitments and the related interest rate lock commitments are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking income huntington also uses certain derivative financial instruments to offset changes in value of its msrs these derivatives consist primarily of forward interest rate agreements and forward mortgage contracts the derivative instruments used are not designated as qualifying hedges accordingly such derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking incomederivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities respectively and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into we designate it as either a qualifying hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedgea qualifying hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset liability or forecasted transaction cash flow hedge ora trading instrument or a nonqualifying economic hedge109table of contentschanges in the fair value of a derivative that has been designated and qualifies as a

into earnings in the period during which the hedged item affects earnings ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship is reflected in current period earnings changes in the fair value of derivatives held for trading purposes or which do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in current period earningsfor those derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied huntington formally documents the hedging relationship and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge this documentation identifies the hedging instrument the hedged item or transaction the nature of the risk being hedged and unless the hedge meets all of the criteria to assume there is no ineffectiveness the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging instrument and how ineffectiveness will be measured the methods utilized to assess retrospective hedge effectiveness as well as the frequency of testing vary based on the type of item being hedged and the designated hedge period for specifically designated fair value hedges of certain fixedrate debt huntington utilizes the shortcut method when certain criteria are met for other fair value hedges of fixedrate debt including certificates of deposit huntington utilizes the regression method to evaluate hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis for fair value hedges of portfolio loans the regression method is used to evaluate effectiveness on a daily basis for cash flow hedges the regression method is applied on a quarterly basishedge accounting is discontinued prospectively whenthe derivative is no longer effective or expected to be effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item including firm commitments or forecasted transactionsthe derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercisedit is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occurthe hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment orthe designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is removedwhen hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value or cash flow hedge the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair valuein the case of a discontinued fair value hedge of a recognized asset or liability as long as the hedged item continues to exist on the balance sheet the hedged item will no longer be adjusted for changes in fair value the basis adjustment that had previously been recorded to the hedged item during the period from the hedge designation date to the hedge discontinuation date is recognized as an adjustment to the yield of the hedged item over the remaining life of the hedged itemin the case of a discontinued cash flow hedge of a recognized asset or liability as long as the hedged item continues to exist on the balance sheet the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the hedging derivative will no longer be recorded to other comprehensive income the balance applicable to the discontinued hedging relationship will be recognized in earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item as an adjustment to yield if the discontinued hedged item was a forecasted transaction that is not expected to occur any amounts recorded on the balance sheet related to the hedged item including any amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified to current period earningsin the case of either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge if the previously hedged item is sold or extinguished the basis adjustment to the underlying asset or liability or any remaining unamortized other comprehensive income balance will be reclassified to current period earningsin all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued the derivative will be carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings unless redesignated as a qualifying hedgelike other financial instruments derivatives contain an element of credit risk which is the possibility that huntington will incur a loss because the counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations notional values of interest rate swaps and other offbalance sheet financial instruments significantly exceed the credit risk associated with these instruments and represent contractual balances on which calculations of amounts to be exchanged are based credit exposure is limited to the sum of the aggregate fair value of positions that have become favorable to huntington including any accrued interest receivable due from counterparties potential credit losses are mitigated through careful evaluation of counterparty credit standing selection of counterparties from a limited group of high quality institutions collateral agreements and other contract provisions huntington considers the value of collateral held and collateral provided in

obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement110table of contentsrepossessed collateral  repossessed collateral also referred to as other real estate owned oreo is comprised principally of commercial and residential real estate properties obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations and is carried at fair value collateral obtained in satisfaction of a loan is recorded at the estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs based upon the propertys appraised value at the date of foreclosure with any difference between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of the loan recorded as a chargeoff if the fair value is higher than the carrying amount of the loan the excess is recognized first as a recovery and then as noninterest income subsequent declines in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are

consolidated balance sheets when purchased or when servicing is contractually separated from the underlying mortgage loans by sale or securitization of the loans with servicing rights retainedfor loan sales with servicing retained a servicing asset is recorded on the day of the sale at fair value for the right to service the loans sold to determine the fair value of a msr huntington uses an option adjusted spread cash flow analysis incorporating market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and market interest rates the forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for us dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments the current and projected mortgage interest rate influences the prepayment rate and therefore the timing and magnitude of the cash flows associated with the msr servicing revenues on mortgage loans are included in mortgage banking incomeat the time of initial capitalization msrs may be grouped into servicing classes based on the availability of market inputs used in determining fair value and the method used for managing the risks of the servicing assets msr assets are recorded using the fair value method or the amortization method the election of the fair value or amortization method is made at the time each servicing class is established all newly created msrs since 2009 were recorded using the amortization method any change in the fair value of msrs carried under the fair value method as well as amortization and impairment of msrs under the amortization

of recoveries and the acl associated with securitized or sold loans during the 2015 first quarter we reviewed our existing commercial and consumer credit models and enhanced certain processes and methods of acl estimation during this review we analyzed the loss emergence periods used for consumer receivables collectively evaluated for impairment and as a result extended our loss emergence periods for products within these portfolios as part of these enhancements to our credit reserve process we also evaluated the methods used to separately estimate economic risks inherent in our portfolios and decided to no longer utilize these separate estimation techniques rather we now incorporate economic risks in our loss estimates elsewhere in our reserve calculation the enhancements made to our credit reserve processes during the quarter allow for increased segmentation and analysis of the estimated incurred losses within our loan portfolios the net acl impact of these enhancements was immaterial119table of contentsduring the 2015 third quarter we reviewed our existing commercial and consumer credit models and completed a periodic reassessment of certain acl assumptions specifically we updated our analysis of the loss emergence periods used for commercial receivables collectively evaluated for impairment based on our observed portfolio experience we

consumer credit risk used by lenders regulators rating agencies and consumers the higher the credit bureau score the higher likelihood of repayment and therefore an indicator of higher credit qualityhuntington assesses the risk in the loan portfolio by utilizing numerous risk characteristics the classifications described above and also presented in the table below represent one of those characteristics that are closely monitored in the overall credit risk management processes121table of contentsthe following table presents each loan and lease class by credit quality indicator for the

the borrower does not reaffirm the discharged debt127table of contentsother a concession that is not categorized as one of the concessions described above these concessions include but are not limited to principal forgiveness collateral concessions covenant concessions and reduction of accrued interest principal forgiveness may result from any tdr modification of any concession type however the aggregate amount of principal forgiven as a result of loans modified as tdrs during the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 was not significantfollowing is a description of tdrs by the different loan typescommercial loan tdrs  commercial accruing tdrs often result from loans receiving a concession with terms that are not considered a market transaction to huntington the tdr remains in accruing status as long as the customer is less than 90days past due on payments per the restructured loan terms and no loss is expectedcommercial nonaccrual tdrs result from either 1 an accruing commercial tdr being placed on nonaccrual status or 2 a workout where an existing commercial nal is restructured and a concession is given at times these workouts restructure the nal so that two or more new notes are created the primary note is underwritten based upon our normal underwriting standards and is sized so projected cash flows are sufficient to repay contractual principal and interest the terms on the secondary notes vary by situation and may include notes that defer principal and interest payments until after the primary note is repaid creating two or more notes often allows the borrower to continue a project and allows huntington to rightsize a loan based upon the current expectations for a borrowers or projects performanceour strategy involving tdr borrowers includes working with these borrowers to allow them to refinance elsewhere as well as allow them time to improve their financial position and remain our customer through refinancing their notes according to market terms and conditions in the future a subsequent refinancing or modification of a loan may occur when either the loan matures according to the terms of the tdrmodified agreement or the borrower requests a change to the loan agreements at that time the loan is evaluated to determine if it is creditworthy it is subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan a new loan is considered for removal of the tdr designation whereas a continuation of the prior note requires a continuation of the tdr designation in order for a tdr designation to be removed the borrower must no longer be experiencing financial difficulties and the terms of the refinanced loan must not represent a concessionresidential mortgage loan tdrs  residential mortgage tdrs represent loan modifications associated with traditional firstlien mortgage loans in which a concession has been provided to the borrower the primary concessions given to residential mortgage borrowers are amortization or maturity date changes and interest rate reductions residential mortgages identified as tdrs involve borrowers unable to refinance their mortgages through the companys normal mortgage origination channels or through other independent sources some but not all of the loans may be delinquentautomobile home equity and other consumer loan tdrs  the company may make similar interest rate term and principal concessions as with residential mortgage loan tdrstdr impact on credit qualityhuntingtons alll is largely determined by updated risk ratings assigned to commercial loans updated borrower credit scores on consumer loans and borrower delinquency history in both the commercial and consumer portfolios these updated risk ratings and credit scores consider the default history of the borrower including payment redefaults as such the provision for credit losses is impacted primarily by changes in borrower payment performance rather than the tdr classification tdrs can be classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans nonaccrual tdrs are included in nals whereas accruing tdrs are excluded from nals as it is probable that all contractual principal and interest due under the restructured terms will be collectedour tdrs may include multiple concessions and the disclosure classifications are presented based on the primary concession provided to the borrower the majority of our concessions for the campi and cre portfolios are the extension of the maturity date  but could also include an increase in the interest rate in these instances the primary concession is the maturity date extensiontdr concessions may also result in the reduction of the alll within the campi and cre portfolios this reduction is derived from payments and the resulting application of the reserve calculation within the alll the transaction reserve for nontdr campi and cre loans is calculated based upon several estimated probability factors such as pd and lgd both of which were previously discussed upon the occurrence of a tdr in our campi and cre portfolios the reserve is measured based on discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs of the modified loan in accordance with asc 31010 the resulting tdr alll calculation often results in a lower alll amount because 1 the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs indicate a lower estimated loss 2 if the modification includes a rate increase the discounting of the cash flows on the modified loan using the premodification interest rate exceeds the carrying value of the loan or 3 payments may occur as part of the modification the alll for campi and cre loans may increase as a result of the modification as the discounted cash flow analysis may indicate additional reserves are requiredtdr concessions on consumer loans may increase the alll the concessions made to these borrowers often include interest rate reductions and therefore the tdr alll calculation results in a greater alll compared with the nontdr calculation as the 128table of contentsreserve is measured based on the estimation of the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs on the modified loan in accordance with asc 31010 the resulting tdr alll calculation often results in a higher alll amount because 1 the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs indicate a higher estimated loss or 2 due to the rate decrease the discounting of the cash flows on the modified loan using the premodification interest rate indicates a reduction in the present value of expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs in certain instances the alll may decrease as a result of payments made in connection with the modificationcommercial loan tdrs  in instances where the bank substantiates that it will collect its outstanding balance in full the note is considered for return to accrual status upon the borrower showing a sustained period of repayment performance for a sixmonth period of time this sixmonth period could extend before or after the restructure date if a chargeoff was taken as part of the restructuring any interest or principal payments received on that note are applied to first reduce the banks outstanding book balance and then to recoveries of chargedoff principal unpaid interest

134table of contentsthe highest risk segment in our investment portfolio is the trust preferred cdo securities which are in the assetbacked securities portfolio this portfolio is in run off and we have not purchased these types of securities since 2005 the fair values of the cdo assets have been impacted by various market conditions the unrealized losses are primarily the result of wider liquidity spreads on assetbacked securities and the longer expected average lives of the trustpreferred cdo securities due to changes in the expectations of when the underlying securities will be repaidcollateralized debt obligations are backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies many collateral issuers have the option of deferring interest payments on their debt for up to five years a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio a thirdparty pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooledtrustpreferred security evaluations is engaged to provide assistance estimating the fair value and expected cash flows on this portfolio the full cash flow analysis is completed by evaluating the relevant credit and structural aspects of each pooledtrustpreferred security in the portfolio including collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in the security and terms of the securitys structure the credit review includes an analysis of profitability credit quality operating efficiency leverage and liquidity using available financial and regulatory information for each underlying collateral issuer the analysis also includes a review of historical industry default data current  near term operating conditions and the impact of macroeconomic and regulatory changes using the results of our analysis we estimate appropriate default and recovery probabilities for each piece of collateral then estimate the expected cash flows for each security the fair value of each security is obtained by discounting the expected cash flows at a market discount rate the market discount rate is determined by reference to yields observed in the market for similarly rated collateralized debt obligations specifically highyield collateralized loan obligations the relatively high market discount rate is reflective of the uncertainty of the cash flows and illiquid nature of these securities the large differential between the fair value and amortized cost of some of the securities reflects the high market discount rate and the expectation that the majority of the cash flows will not be received until near the final maturity of the security the final maturities range from 2032 to 2035on december 10 2013 the federal reserve the occ the fdic the cftc and the sec issued final rules to implement the volcker rule contained in section 619 of the doddfrank act generally to become effective on july 21 2015 the volcker rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates referred to as banking entities from i engaging in proprietary trading and ii investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds covered funds subject to certain limited exceptions these prohibitions impact the ability of us banking entities to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with nonus banking organizations in overseas markets the rule also effectively prohibits shortterm trading strategies by any us banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for tradingon january 14 2014 the five federal agencies approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of section 619 of the volcker rule under the interim final rule the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities if certain qualifications are met in addition the agencies released a nonexclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of the interim final rule at december 31 2015 we had investments in eight different pools of trust preferred securities seven of our pools are included in the list of nonexclusive issuers we have analyzed the icons pool that was not included on the list and believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to hold the icons security to recovery under the final volcker rule regulationsthe following table summarizes the relevant characteristics of our cdo securities portfolio which are included in assetbacked securities at december 31 2015 and 2014 each security is part of a pool of issuers and supports a more senior tranche of securities except for

considers portfolio characteristics contractually specified servicing fees and assumptions related to prepayments delinquency rates late charges other ancillary revenues costs to service and other economic factors changes in the assumptions used may have a significant impact on the valuation of msrsmsr values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing

carryforward of 1 million which may be carried forward indefinitely a general business credit carryforward of 1 million which will begin expiring in 2031 and a capital loss carryforward of 13 million which expires in 2018in prior periods huntington established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for federal capital loss carryforwards state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards the federal valuation allowance was based on the uncertainty of forecasted federal taxable income expected of the required character in order to utilize the capital loss carryforward the state valuation allowance was based on the uncertainty of forecasted state taxable income expected in applicable jurisdictions in order to utilize the state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards based on current analysis of both positive and negative evidence and projected forecasted taxable income of the appropriate character andor within applicable jurisdictions the company believes that it is more likely than not the federal capital loss carryforward and portions of the state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards will be realized as a result of this analysis there is no federal capital loss carryforward valuation allowance remaining at december 31 2015 compared to 69 million at december 31 2014 and the state

typesmortgage loans held for investmentmortgages are loans originated with the intent to sell and are measured at fair value with adjustments recognized through the consolidated statements of income during the year certain mortgage loans have been reclassified to mortgage loans held for investment these loans continue to be measured at fair value the fair value is determined using fair value of mortgagebacked securities adjusted for loan specific variablesavailableforsale securities and trading account securitiessecurities accounted for at fair value include both the availableforsale and trading portfolios huntington uses prices obtained from thirdparty pricing services and recent trades to determine the fair value of securities afs and trading securities are classified as level 1 using quoted market prices unadjusted in active markets for identical securities that huntington has the ability to access at the measurement date less than 1 of the positions in these portfolios are level 1 and consist of us treasury securities and money market mutual funds when quoted market prices are not available fair values are classified as level 2 using quoted prices for similar assets in active markets quoted prices of identical or similar assets in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 74 of the positions in these portfolios are level 2 and consist of us government and agency debt securities agency mortgage backed securities assetbacked securities municipal securities and other securities for level 2 securities management uses various methods and techniques to corroborate prices obtained from the pricing service including references to dealer or other market quotes and by reviewing valuations of comparable instruments if relevant market prices are limited or unavailable valuations may require significant management judgment or estimation to determine fair value in which case the fair values are classified as level 3 26 of our positions are level 3 and consist of privatelabel cmo securities cdopreferred securities and municipal securities a significant change in the unobservable inputs for these securities may result in a significant change in the ending fair value measurement of these securitiesthe municipal securities portion that is classified as level 3 uses significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the fair value is determined by utilizing thirdparty valuation services the thirdparty service provider reviews credit worthiness prevailing market rates analysis of similar securities and projected cash flows the thirdparty service provider also incorporates industry and general economic conditions into their analysis huntington evaluates the analysis provided for reasonablenessthe private label cmo and cdopreferred securities portfolios are classified as level 3 and as such use significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the private label cmo securities portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows while the cash flows of the cdopreferred securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties and are used as a basis for impairment analysisprivatelabel cmo securities are collateralized by firstlien residential mortgage loans the securities valuation methodology incorporates values obtained from a thirdparty pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and a proprietary pricing model and includes assumptions management believes market participants would use to value the securities under current market conditions the model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds losses recoveries default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures house price depreciation  appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts and discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities with similar collateral structures the privatelabel cmo securities were sold during the 2015 third quarter cdopreferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies a cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio we engage a thirdparty pricing specialist with direct industry experience in cdopreferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio the pd of each issuer 161table of contentsand the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value management evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the thirdparty pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter actual defaults and deferrals in the current period and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair valueautomobile loanseffective january 1 2010 huntington consolidated an automobile loan securitization that previously had been accounted for as an offbalance sheet transaction as a result huntington elected to account for these automobile loan receivables at fair value per guidance supplied in asc 825 the automobile loan receivables are classified as level 3 the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the automobile loan receivables included projections of expected losses and prepayment of the underlying loans in the portfolio and a market assumption of interest rate spreads certain interest rates are available from similarly traded securities while other interest rates are developed internally based on similar assetbacked security transactions in the market during the

do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices accordingly the fair value of these assets is classified as level 3 huntington determines the fair value of msrs using an income approach model based upon our monthend interest rate curve and prepayment assumptions the model utilizes assumptions to estimate future net servicing income cash flows including estimates of time decay payoffs and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions servicing brokers and other sources of information eg discussion with other mortgage servicers and industry surveys are used to obtain information on market practice and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis thirdparty marks are obtained from at least one servicing broker huntington reviews the valuation assumptions against this

final approvalderivative assets and liabilitiesderivatives classified as level 2 consist of foreign exchange and commodity contracts which are valued using exchange traded swaps and futures market data in addition level 2 includes interest rate contracts which are valued using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates current market interest rates level 2 also includes exchange traded options and forward commitments to deliver mortgagebacked securities which are valued using quoted pricesderivatives classified as level 3 consist of interest rate lock agreements related to mortgage loan commitments the determination of fair value includes assumptions related to the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan which is a significant unobservable assumption

shortterm assets which include cash and due from banks interestbearing deposits in banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements loan commitments and lettersofcredit generally have shortterm variablerate features and contain clauses that limit huntingtons exposure to changes in customer credit quality accordingly their carrying values which are immaterial at the respective balance sheet dates are reasonable estimates of fair value certain assets the most significant being operating lease assets bank owned life insurance and premises and equipment do not meet the definition of a financial instrument and are excluded from this disclosure similarly mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights deposit base and other customer relationship intangibles are not considered financial instruments and are not included above accordingly this fair value information is not intended to and does not represent huntingtons underlying value many of the assets and liabilities subject to the disclosure requirements are not actively traded requiring fair values to be estimated by management these estimations necessarily involve the use of judgment about a wide variety of factors including but not limited to relevancy of market prices of comparable instruments expected future cash flows and appropriate discount ratesthe following methods and assumptions were used by huntington to estimate the fair value of the remaining classes of financial instrumentsheldtomaturity securitiesfair values are determined by using models that are based on securityspecific details as well as relevant industry and economic factors the most significant of these inputs are quoted market prices and interest rate spreads on relevant benchmark securitiesloans and direct financing leasesvariablerate loans that reprice frequently are based on carrying amounts as adjusted for estimated credit losses the fair values for other loans and leases are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and employ interest rates currently being offered for loans and leases with similar terms the rates take into account the position of the yield curve as well as an adjustment for prepayment risk operating costs and profit this value is also reduced by an estimate of expected losses and the credit risk associated in the loan and lease portfolio the valuation of the loan portfolio reflected discounts that huntington believed are consistent with transactions occurring in the marketplacedepositsdemand deposits savings accounts and money market deposits are by definition equal to the amount payable on demand the fair values of fixedrate time deposits are estimated by discounting cash flows using interest rates currently being offered on certificates with similar maturitiesdebtlongterm debt is based upon quoted market prices which are inclusive of huntingtons credit risk in the absence of quoted market prices discounted cash flows using market rates for similar debt with the same maturities are used in the determination of fair value18 derivative financial instruments170table of contentsderivative financial instruments are recorded in the

variablerate and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these

many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these

to third parties at december 31 2015 and 2014 huntington had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of 659 million and 545 million respectively these contracts mature in less than one yearlitigationthe nature of huntingtons business ordinarily results in a certain amount of pending as well as threatened claims litigation investigations regulatory and legal and administrative cases matters and proceedings all of which are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business when the company determines it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted it vigorously defends itself the company considers settlement of cases when in managements judgment it is in the best interests of both the company and its shareholders to do soon at least a quarterly basis huntington assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with threatened and outstanding legal cases matters and proceedings utilizing the latest information available for cases matters and proceedings where it is both probable the company will incur a loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated huntington establishes an accrual for the loss once established the accrual is adjusted as appropriate to reflect any relevant developments for cases matters or proceedings where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated no accrual is establishedin certain cases matters and proceedings exposure to loss exists in excess of the accrual to the extent such loss is reasonably possible but not probable management believes an estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued for current legal proceedings is from 0 to approximately 80 million at december 31 2015 for certain other cases and matters management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss at this time any estimate involves significant judgment given the varying stages of the proceedings including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages the existence of multiple defendants in several of the current proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined the numerous unresolved issues in many of the proceedings and the inherent uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings accordingly managements estimate will change from timetotime and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimatewhile the final outcome of legal cases matters and proceedings is inherently uncertain based on information currently available advice of counsel and available insurance coverage management believes that the amount it has already accrued is adequate and any incremental liability arising from the companys legal cases matters or proceedings will not have a material negative adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position as a whole however in the event of unexpected future developments it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these cases matters and proceedings if unfavorable may be material to the companys consolidated financial position in a particular periodcyberco litigation the bank has been named a defendant in two lawsuits arising from the banks commercial lending depository and equipment leasing relationships with cyberco holdings inc cyberco based in grand rapids michigan in november 2004 the federal bureau of investigation and the

business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions additionally because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entitiesrevenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocationsthe management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all five business segments from treasury  other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury  other expenses except reported significant items and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the five business segmentswe use an active and centralized funds transfer pricing ftp methodology to attribute appropriate income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury  other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury  other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp
