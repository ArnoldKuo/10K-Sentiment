 the bank currently has a written governance framework and associated controlslegislative and regulatory reforms continue to have significant impacts throughout the financial services industrythe doddfrank act enacted in 2010 is complex and broad in scope and several of its provisions are still being implemented the doddfrank act established the cfpb which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services and the financial stability oversight council which has oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk in addition the doddfrank act altered the authority and duties of the federal banking and securities regulatory agencies implemented certain corporate governance requirements for all public companies including financial institutions with regard to executive compensation proxy access by shareholders and certain whistleblower provisions and restricted certain proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks and their affiliates the doddfrank act also required the issuance of numerous implementing regulations many of which have not yet been issued the regulations will continue to take effect over several more years continuing to make it difficult to anticipate the overall impact to us our customers or the financial industry in generalon october 3 2015 the cfpbs final rules on integrated mortgage disclosures under the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act became effective on january 1 2016 most requirements of the occs final rule in loans in areas having special flood hazards the flood final rule became effective including the requirement that flood insurance premiums and fees for most mortgage loans be escrowed subject to certain exceptions the flood final rule also incorporated other existing flood insurance requirements and exceptions eg the exemption from flood insurance requirements for nonresidential detached structures  a discretionary item with those portions of the flood final rule becoming effective on october 1 2015 we continue to monitor evaluate and implement these new regulationsthroughout 2015 the cfpb continued its focus on fair lending practices of indirect automobile lenders this focus led to some lenders to enter into consent orders with the cfpb and department of justice indirect automobile lenders have also received continued pressure from the cfpb to limit or eliminate discretionary pricing by dealers finally the cfpb has implemented its 11table of contentslarger participant rule for indirect automobile lending which brings larger nonbank indirect automobile lenders under cfpb supervisionbanking regulatory agencies have increasingly used their authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices udap by banks under standards developed many years ago by the federal trade commission in order to address practices that may not necessarily fall within the scope of a specific banking or consumer finance law the doddfrank act also gave to the cfpb similar authority to take action in connection with unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices udaap by entities subject to cfpb supervisory or enforcement authority banks face considerable uncertainty as to the regulatory interpretation of abusive practicesfinancial services companies face increased regulation and exposure under the new military lending act mla final rules issued by the department of defense that become effective for new loans entered into on and after october 3 2016 the new rules dramatically expand the scope of coverage of the mla and compliance with the new rules will affect operations of more financial services companies than under the previous rules on july 10 2015 the federal communication commission interpreting the telephone consumer protection act issued an omnibus declaratory ruling and order that among other things restricted the use of automated telephone dialing machines the ruling effectively increases the cost of collecting debts as well as increases the litigation risk associated with the use of autodialerslarge bank holding companies and national banks are required to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve and occ respectively and conduct stress teststhe federal reserves regulation y requires large bank holding companies to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and requires such bank holding companies to obtain approval from the federal reserve under certain circumstances before making a capital distribution this rule applies to us and all other bank holding companies with 50 billion or more of total consolidated assetsa large bank holding companys capital plan must include an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over at least the next nine quarters a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon a detailed description of the entitys process for assessing capital adequacy the entitys capital policy and a discussion of any expected changes to the bank holding companys business plan that are likely to have a material impact on the firms capital adequacy or liquidity the planning horizon for the most recently completed capital planning and stress testing cycle encompasses the 2014 fourth quarter through the 2016 fourth quarter as was submitted in our capital plan in january 2015 rules to implement the basel iii capital reforms in the united states were finalized in july 2013 and are being phasedin by us beginning with 1q 2015 results under the standardized approach capital adequacy at large banking organizations including us is assessed against a minimum 45 cet1 ratio and a 4 tier 1 leverage ratio as determined by the federal reservecapital plans for 2016 are required to be submitted to the federal reserve by april 5 2016 and the federal reserve will either object to the capital plan andor planned capital actions or provide a notice of nonobjection no later than june 30 2016 we intend to submit our capital plan to the federal reserve on or before april 5 2016 there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will respond favorably to our capital plan capital actions or stress test and the federal reserve occ or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including common stock dividends and stock repurchasesin addition to the ccar submission section 165 of the doddfrank act requires that national banks like the huntington national bank conduct annual stress tests for submission beginning in january 2015 the results of the stress tests will provide the occ with forwardlooking information that will be used in bank supervision and will assist the agency in assessing a companys risk profile and capital adequacy we submitted our stress test results to the occ in january 2015 we intend to submit our 2016 capital plan to the occ on or before april 5 2016 the regulatory capital rules indicate that common stockholders equity should be the dominant element within tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on noncommon equity elements under the doddfrank act the ratio of common equity tier 1 to riskweighted assets became significant as a measurement of the predominance of common equity in tier 1 capital and an indication of the quality of capital in accordance with their requirementsconforming covered activities to implement the volcker ruleon december 10 2013 the federal reserve the occ the fdic the cftc and the sec issued final rules to implement the volcker rule contained in section 619 of the doddfrank act and established july 21 2015 as the end of the conformance period section 619 generally prohibits an insured depository institution any company that controls an insured depository institution such 12table of contentsas a bank holding company and any of their subsidiaries and affiliates collectively banking entities from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining ownership interests in sponsoring or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund covered funds these prohibitions are subject to a number of statutory exemptions restrictions and definitions on december 18 2014 the federal reserve announced it acted under section 619 to give banking entities until july 21 2016 to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to december 31 2013 legacy covered funds the federal reserve also announced its intention to act this year to grant banking entities an additional oneyear extension of the conformance period until july 21 2017 to conform ownership interests in and relationships with legacy covered funds the bank continues its good faith efforts to conform with proprietary trading prohibitions and associated compliance requirements the company does not expect volcker compliance to have a material impact on its business modelthe volcker rules prohibitions impact the ability of us banking entities to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with nonus banking organizations in overseas markets the rule also effectively prohibits shortterm trading strategies by any us banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for tradingthe final volcker rule regulations do provide certain exemptions allowing banking entities to continue underwriting marketmaking and hedging activities and trading certain government obligations as well as various exemptions and exclusions from the definition of covered funds the level of required compliance activity depends on the size of the banking entity and the extent of its trading ceos of larger banking entities including huntington have to attest annually in writing that their organization has in place processes to establish maintain enforce review test and modify compliance with the volcker rule regulations banking entities with significant permitted trading operations will have to report certain quantitative information beginning between june 30 2014 and december 31 2016 depending on the size of the banking entitys trading assets and liabilitieson january 14 2014 the five federal agencies approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of the volcker rule under the interim final rule the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities if certain qualifications are met in addition the agencies released a nonexclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of the interim final rule at december 31 2015 we had investments in eight different pools of trust preferred securities seven of our pools are included in the list of nonexclusive issuers we have analyzed the other pool that was not included on the list and believe that we will continue to be able to own this investment under the final volcker rule regulationsthere are restrictions on our ability to pay dividendsdividends from the bank to the parent company are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders however there are statutory limits on the amount of dividends that the bank can pay to the holding company regulatory approval is required prior to the declaration of any dividends in an amount greater than its undivided profits or if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus or common stock the bank is currently able to pay dividends to the holding company subject to these limitationsif in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice such authority may require after notice and hearing that such bank cease and desist from such practice depending on the financial condition of the bank the applicable regulatory authority might deem us to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice if the bank were to pay dividends to the holding companythe federal reserve and the occ have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings additionally the federal reserve may prohibit or limit bank holding companies from making capital distributions including payment of preferred and common dividends as part of the annual capital plan approval processwe are subject to the current capital requirements mandated by the federal reserve and basel iii capital and liquidity frameworksthe federal reserve sets riskbased capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies under the guidelines and related policies bank holding companies must maintain capital sufficient to meet both a riskbased asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis the riskbased ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet commitments into riskweighted categories with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived as representing greater risk the riskbased ratio represents total capital divided by total riskweighted assets the leverage ratio is core capital divided by total assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines the bank is subject to substantially similar capital requirements13table of contentsin 2013 the federal reserve and the occ adopted final capital rules implementing basel iii requirements for us banking organizations the final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and implement in the united states the basel iii regulatory capital reforms from the basel committee on banking supervision and certain changes required by the doddfrank act under the final rule minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations consistent with the international basel framework the final rule includes a new minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and a capital conservation buffer of 25 of riskweighted assets that will apply to all supervised financial institutions the rule also raises the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4 these new minimum capital ratios were effective for us on january 1 2015 and will be fully phasedin on january 1 2019the following are the basel iii regulatory capital levels that we must satisfy to

rule also improves the methodology for calculating riskweighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity banks and regulators use risk weighting to assign different levels of risk to different classes of assetsbased on the final basel iii rule banking organizations with more than 15 billion in total consolidated assets are required to phaseout of additional tier 1 capital any nonqualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred shares issued before september 12 2010 we began the additional tier 1 capital phaseout of our trust preferred securities in 2015 but will be able to include these instruments in tier 2 capital as a nonadvanced approaches institutionunder basel iii cet1 predominantly includes common stockholders equity less certain deductions for goodwill and other intangible assets net of related taxes overfunded net pension fund assets and dtas that arise from tax loss and credit carryforwards we elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from cet1 as permitted in the final rule tier 1 capital is predominantly comprised of cet1 as well as perpetual preferred stock and qualifying minority interests total capital predominantly includes tier 1 capital as well as certain longterm debt and allowance for credit losses qualifying for tier 2 capital the calculations of cet1 tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital include phaseout periods for certain instruments from january 2015 through december 2017 the primary items subject to the phaseout from capital for us are other intangible assets dtas that arise from tax loss and credit carryforwards and trust preferred securitiesriskweighted assets under the basel iii standardized approach are generally based on supervisory risk weightings that vary only by counterparty type and asset class the revisions to supervisory risk weightings for basel iii enhance risk sensitivity and include alternatives to the use of credit ratings when calculating the risk weight for certain assets specifically basel iii includes a more risksensitive treatment for past due and nonaccrual loans certain commercial loans msrs and certain unfunded commitments basel iii also prescribes a new formulaic approach for calculating the risk weight of securitization exposures that is also more risk sensitivefailure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the financial institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities these include limitations on the ability to pay dividends the issuance by the regulatory authority of a directive to increase capital and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic in addition the financial institution could be subject to the measures described below under prompt corrective action as applicable to undercapitalized institutionsthe riskbased capital standards of the federal reserve the occ and the fdic specify that evaluations by the banking agencies of a banks capital adequacy will include an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of a banks capital due to changes in interest rates these banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active oversight of risk management activities by senior management14table of

depository institution would become undercapitalized after such payment undercapitalized institutions are also subject to growth limitations and are required by the appropriate federal banking agency to submit a capital restoration plan if any depository institution subsidiary of a holding company is required to submit a capital restoration plan the holding company would be required to provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of such plandepending upon the severity of the under capitalization the undercapitalized institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequatelycapitalized requirements to reduce total assets cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks and restrictions on making any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming so classifiedunder fdicia a wellcapitalized bank may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval a depository institution that is not wellcapitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market since the bank is wellcapitalized the fdicia brokered deposit rule did not adversely affect its ability to accept brokered deposits the bank had 29 billion of such brokered deposits at december 31 2015on september 3 2014 the us banking regulators approved a final rule to implement the us version of the basel committees minimum liquidity coverage ratio lcr requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of 250

covered banking organizations to maintain an amount of unencumbered hqla equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendarday stress scenario we are covered by the modified lcr requirement and therefore subject to the initial phasein of the rule beginning in january 2016 with the requirement fully phasedin january 2017 we will also be required to calculate the lcr monthly the modified

pursuant to each rule in december 2015as a bank holding company we must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the bankunder the doddfrank act a bank holding company must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and must commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank the federal reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank it may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the federal reserve believes might jeopardize the bank holding companys ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bankany loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy an appointed bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank moreover the bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institutions general unsecured creditors including the holders of its note obligationsfederal law permits the occ to order the prorata assessment of shareholders of a national bank whose capital stock has become impaired by losses or otherwise to relieve a deficiency in such national banks capital stock this statute also provides for the enforcement of any such prorata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of capital stock by sale to the extent

imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the banks bank holding company and certain companies the bank holding company may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on armslength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the banks regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bank holding company may be required to provide itprovisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of i the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment advisor ii credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and iii transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction they also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july 21 2012 the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement themas a financial holding company we are subject to additional laws and regulationsas a financial holding company we are permitted to engage in and affiliate with financial companies engaging in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company in order to maintain our status as a financial holding company we and the bank must each remain wellcapitalized and wellmanaged in addition the bank

by the federal reserve in coordination with the secretary of the treasury to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity provided that the complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness risk in addition we are required by the bank holding company act to obtain federal reserve approval prior to acquiring directly or indirectly ownership or control of voting shares of any bank if after such acquisition we would own or control more than 5 of its voting stock furthermore the doddfrank act added a new provision to the bank holding company act which requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than 50 billion to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve to acquire a nondepository company having total consolidated assets of 10 billion or morewe also must comply with antimoney laundering and customer privacy regulations as well as corporate governance

financial regulators issued a proposed rule in april 2011 pursuant to the doddfrank act to adopt standards for determining whether an incentivebased compensation arrangement may encourage inappropriate risktaking that are consistent with the key principles established for incentive compensation in the guidance the proposed rule would apply to financial institutions with 1 billion or

multifaceted approach to risk governance it begins with the board of directors defining our risk appetite as aggregate moderatetolow this does not preclude engagement in select higher risk activities rather the definition is intended to represent an aggregate view of where we want our overall risk to be managedthree board committees primarily oversee implementation of this desired risk appetite and monitoring of our risk profile the audit committee oversees the integrity of the consolidated financial statements including policies procedures and practices regarding the preparation of financial statements the financial reporting process disclosures and internal control over financial reporting the audit committee also provides assistance to the board in overseeing the internal audit division and the independent registered public accounting firms qualifications and independence compliance with our financial code of ethics for the chief executive officer and senior financial

technology cyber security and thirdparty risk management strategies and plans the committee is charged with evaluating huntingtons capability to properly perform all technology functions necessary for its business plan including projected growth technology capacity planning operational execution product development and management capacity the committee provides oversight of the technology segment investments and plans to drive efficiency as well as to meet defined standards for risk security and redundancy the committee oversees the allocation of technology costs and ensures that they are understood by the board of directors the technology committee monitors and evaluates innovation and technology trends that may affect the companys strategic plans including monitoring of overall industry trends the technology committee reviews and provides oversight of the companys continuity and disaster recovery planning and preparednessthe audit and risk oversight committees routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and risk management on a periodic basis the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both such as the construct and appropriateness of the acl which is reviewed quarterly all directors have access to information provided to each committee and all scheduled meetings are open to all directorsfurther through its compensation committee the board of directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards is risksensitive and aligns the interests of management creditors and shareholders we utilize a variety of compensationrelated tools to induce appropriate behavior including common stock ownership thresholds for the chief executive officer and certain members of senior management a requirement to hold until retirement or exit from the company a portion of net shares received upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards 50 for executive officers and 25 for other award recipients equity deferrals recoupment provisions and the right to terminate compensation plans at any timemanagement has implemented an enterprise risk management and risk appetite framework critically important is our selfassessment process in which each business segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls the segment analyses are combined with assessments by our risk management organization of major risk sectors eg credit market liquidity operational legal compliance reputational and strategic to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment outcomes of the process include a determination of the quality of the overall control process the direction of risk and our position compared to the defined risk appetitemanagement also utilizes a wide series of metrics key risk indicators to monitor risk positions throughout the company in general a range for each metric is established which allows the company in aggregate to operate within an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile deviations from the range will indicate if the risk being measured exceeds desired tolerance which may then necessitate corrective actionwe also have four executive level committees to manage risk alco credit policy and strategy risk management and capital management each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature we believe this structure helps ensure appropriate escalation of issues and overall communication of strategies18table of contentshuntington utilizes three lines of defense with regard to risk management 1 business segments 2 corporate risk management and 3 internal audit and credit review to induce greater ownership of risk within its business segments segment risk officers have been embedded to identify and monitor risk elevate and remediate issues establish controls perform selftesting and oversee the selfassessment process

risk assessment the chief risk officer has significant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans as they apply to risk internal audit and credit review provide additional assurance that riskrelated functions are operating as intendedrisk overviewwe like other financial companies are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations many of which are outside of our direct control though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns among the risks assumed are credit risk which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms market risk which occurs when fluctuations in interest rates impact earnings and capital financial impacts are realized through changes in the interest rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities net interest margin or directly through valuation changes of capitalized msr andor trading assets noninterest income liquidity risk which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels liquidity risk also results from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the banks ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value operational and legal risk which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems human errors or misconduct or adverse external events operational losses result from internal fraud external fraud inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety failure to meet professional obligations involving customers products and business practices damage to physical assets business disruption and systems failures and failures in execution delivery and process management legal risk includes but is not limited to exposure to orders fines penalties or punitive damages resulting from litigation as well as regulatory actions and compliance risk which exposes us to money penalties enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws rules and regulations that apply to the financial services industrywe also expend considerable effort to contain risk which emanates from execution of our business processes and strategies and work relentlessly to protect the companys reputation strategic risk and reputational risk do not easily lend themselves to traditional methods of measurement rather we closely monitor them through processes such as new product  initiative reviews frequent financial performance reviews colleague and client surveys monitoring market intelligence periodic discussions between management and our board and other such effortsin addition to the other information

conditions affecting these sectorsmarket risks1 changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income reduce transactional income and negatively impact the value of our loans securities and other assets this could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows financial condition results of operations and capitalour results of operations depend substantially on net interest income which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions conditions such as inflation deflation recession unemployment money supply and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates if our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment net interest income could be materially adversely impacted likewise if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment net interest income could be adversely impacted the continuation of the current low interest rate environment or a deflationary environment with negative interest rates could affect consumer and business behavior in ways that are adverse to us and could also constrict our net interest income margin which may restrict our ability to increase net interest incomechanges in interest rates can affect the value of loans securities assets under management and other assets including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights an increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in npas and a reduction of income recognized which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows when we place a loan on nonaccrual status we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable which decreases interest income however we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding nals without any corresponding interest income in addition transactional income including trust income brokerage income and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from periodtoperiod based on a number of factors including the interest rate environment a decline in interest rates along with a flattening yield curve limits our ability to reprice deposits given the current historically low level of interest rates and could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits rising interest rates

of contents2 industry competition may have an adverse effect on our successour profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully we operate in a highly competitive environment and we expect competition to intensify due in part to the sustained low interest rate and ongoing lowgrowth economic environment certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits in our market areas we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and therefore may have greater flexibility in competing for business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including customer convenience quality of service by investing in new products and services personal contacts pricing and range of products if we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in particular if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability or a desire to do business with our competitors we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin for more information refer to competition section of item 1 businessliquidity

basis at a reasonable cost the bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers the board of directors establishes liquidity policies and limits and management establishes operating guidelines for liquidityour primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers the continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular the availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes eg changes in fdic insurance the liquidity coverage ratio etc and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits while we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding market related geopolitical or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits2 if we lose access to capital markets we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors creditors and borrowers or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activitieswholesale

colleagues business disruption and system failures huntington executes against a significant number of controls a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and thirdparty service providers there is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack these operational risks could lead to financial loss expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and the capital marketsmoreover negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including clients products and business practices corporate governance acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory actionrelative to acquisitions we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions including our pending acquisition of firstmerit corporation acquisitions may be subject to and our pending acquisition of firstmerit corporation is subject to the receipt of approvals from certain governmental authorities including the federal reserve the occ and the united states department of justice as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire these approvals for acquisitions may not be received may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions subject to requisite regulatory approvals future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock which would dilute current shareholders ownership interests additionally acquisitions may also involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction 22table of contents4 failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock priceeffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud as a financial holding company we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures such controls and procedures are modified supplemented and changed from timetotime as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments any failure to maintain in the future an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis which could result in regulatory actions loss of investor confidence and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price5 we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial valuesquantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including estimating probable loan losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk and for capital planning purposes including during the ccar capital planning and capital adequacy process our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses particularly in times of market distress and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code bad data misuse of data or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the models designall models have certain limitations reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect missing or misleading information in addition our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable also information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleadingbanking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate including distributions to our shareholders could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient6 we rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure we rely on thirdparty service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice provide enhanced products and services and reduce costs although there are benefits in entering into thirdparty relationships with vendors and others there are risks associated with such activities when entering a thirdparty relationship the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the thirdparty but remain our responsibility the technology committee of the board of directors provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with thirdparty relationships management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing thirdparty relationships management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships increased risk could occur based on poor planning oversight and control and inferior performance or service on the part of the thirdparty and may result in legal costs or loss of business while we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of thirdparty service providers any problems caused by thirdparty service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business replacing a thirdparty service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses7 changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operationsthe fasb regulatory agencies and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements additionally those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations the fasb is currently close to issuing several new accounting standards that will have significant impacts on the banking industry most notably new guidance on the calculation of credit reserves using expected losses current expected credit losses versus incurred losses is close to being finalized and upon implementation could 23table of

capital rules for us banking organizations the final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the united states the basel iii regulatory capital reforms from the basel committee on banking supervision and certain changes required by the doddfrank act under the final rule minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations as a standardized approach institution the basel iii minimum capital requirements became effective for us on january 1 2015 and will be fully phasedin on january 1 2019on september 3 2014 the us banking regulators approved a final rule to implement a minimum liquidity coverage ratio lcr requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more and a less stringent modified lcr requirement to depository institution holding companies below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the lcr requires covered banking organizations to maintain hqla equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendarday stress scenario we are covered by the modified lcr requirement and therefore subject to the phasein of the rule beginning january 2016 at 90 and january 2017 at 100 we will also be required to calculate the lcr monthly the lcr assigns less severe outflow assumptions to certain types of customer deposits which should increase the demand and perhaps the cost among banks for these deposits additionally the hqla requirements will increase the demand for direct us government and us
