capital requirementshuntington and the bank are subject to certain riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements the federal reserve establishes capital and leverage requirements for huntington and evaluates its compliance with such requirements the occ establishes similar capital and leverage requirements for the bank in 2013 the federal reserve and occ issued final rules and the fdic issued interim final rules that were adopted as final rules in april 2014 to implement the basel iii capital accord as well as certain requirements of the doddfrank act the final capital rules made a number of significant changes to the regulatory capital ratios applicable to huntington and the bank as well as all other banks and bhcs of their size in addition the capital rules modified the types of capital instruments that may be included in regulatory capital and how certain assets are riskweighted for purposes of these calculationsunder the final capital rules huntington and the bank must maintain a minimum cet1 riskbased ratio a minimum tier i riskbased capital ratio a minimum total riskbased capital ratio and a minimum leverage ratio the final capital rules also limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonuses if a banking organization does not maintain certain capital ratios the preamble to the final capital rules states that these quantitative calculations are minimums and that the agencies may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to be operate in a safe and sound manner in addition the final capital rules generally provide that trust preferred securities and certain preferred securities no longer count as tier i capital banking organizations with more than 15 billion in total consolidated assets were required to phaseout of additional tier 1 capital any nonqualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred shares issued before september 12 2010 we have phased out the additional tier 1 capital treatment of our trust preferred securities but are including these instruments in tier 2 capital as allowed by

with consolidated assets of more than 50 billion such as huntington are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements as a result huntington is subject to more stringent standards and requirements including liquidity and capital requirements leverage limits stress testing risk management standards than those applicable to smaller institutions with regard to resiliency we are expected to ensure that the consolidated organization and its core business lines can survive under a broad range of internal or external stresses this requires financial resilience by maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity and operational resilience by maintaining effective corporate governance risk management and recovery planning with respect to lowering the probability of failure we are expected to ensure the sustainability of our critical operations and banking offices under a broad range of internal or external stresses comprehensive capital analysis and review huntington is required to submit a capital plan annually to the federal reserve for supervisory review in connection with its annual ccar process huntington is required to include within its capital plan an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon a detailed description of the process for assessing capital adequacy its capital policy and a discussion of any expected changes to its business plan that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy the planning horizon for the most recently completed capital planning and stress testing cycle encompassed the ninequarter period from the first quarter of 2016 through the first quarter of 2018 currently the federal reserve may object to a bhcs capital plan based on either quantitative or qualitative grounds if the federal reserve objects to a bhcs capital plan the bhc may not make any capital distribution unless the federal reserve indicates in writing that it does not object to the distribution under ccar the federal reserve makes a qualitative assessment of capital adequacy on a forwardlooking basis and reviews the strength of a bhcs capital adequacy process the federal reserve also makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisoryrun stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above certain minimum ratios after taking all capital actions included in a bhcs capital plan under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a ninequarter planning horizon as part of ccar the federal reserve evaluates whether bhcs have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether they have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risksthe federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar such as huntington to have sufficient capital to withstand a highly adverse operating environment and to be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and serve as credit intermediaries in addition the federal reserve evaluates the planned capital actions of these bhcs including planned capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases we generally may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve and as to which the federal reserve has not objected in addition we are generally prohibited from making a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution we will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios 11table of contentson september 30 2016 the federal reserve issued a proposed rule to amend the capital plan and stress test rules for large and noncomplex bhcs such as huntington to provide among other things that beginning with the 2017 ccar cycle such bhcs would continue to submit a capital plan for quantitative assessment but would no longer be subject to a nonobjection from a qualitative aspect the federal reserve is proposing to evaluate the strength of a large and noncomplex companys qualitative capital planning process through the regular supervisory process and targeted horizontal reviews of particular aspects of capital planning a final rule implementing the changes described above was issued on february 3 2017huntington submitted its 2016 capital plan to the federal reserve in april 2016 the federal reserve did not object to huntingtons 2016 capital plan huntington is required and intends to submit to the federal reserve its capital plan for 2017 by april 5 2017 there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will respond favorably to huntingtons 2017 capital plan capital actions or stress test results stress testingthe doddfrank act requires a semiannual supervisory stress test of bhcs including huntington with 50 billion or more of total consolidated assets this doddfrank act supervisory stress testing is a forwardlooking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on bhc capital the doddfrank act also requires bhcs to conduct companyrun annual and semiannual stress tests the results of which are filed with the federal reserve and publicly disclosed a bhcs ability to make capital distributions is limited to the extent the bhcs actual capital levels are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan submission the doddfrank act also requires a national bank such as the bank with total consolidated assets of more than 10 billion to conduct annual companyrun stress tests the objective of the annual companyrun stress test is to ensure that covered institutions have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and to help ensure that institutions have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress a covered institution is required to publish a summary of the results of its annual stress tests liquidity coverage ratioon september 3 2014 the us banking regulators approved a final rule which became effective on january 1 2015 to implement a minimum lcr requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more and a less stringent modified lcr requirement to depository institution holding companies such as huntington below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the lcr requires covered banking organizations to maintain hqla equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendarday stress scenario huntington is covered by the modified lcr requirement and therefore subject to the phasein of the rule beginning january 2016 at 90 and january 2017 at 100 huntington is required to calculate the lcr monthly the lcr assigns less severe outflow assumptions to certain types of customer deposits which should increase the demand and perhaps the cost among banks for these deposits additionally the hqla requirements has increased the demand for direct us government and us governmentguaranteed debt that while high quality generally carry lower yields than other securities that banks hold in their investment portfoliosrestrictions on dividendsat the holding company level huntington relies on dividends distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries particularly the bank to fund the dividends paid to its shareholders as well as to satisfy its debt and other obligations certain federal and state statutes regulations and contractual restrictions limit the ability of our subsidiaries including the bank to pay dividends to us the occ has authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the bank if in the occs view payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank in addition huntingtons ability to pay dividends or return capital to its shareholders whether through an increase in common stock dividends or through a share repurchase program is subject to the oversight of the federal reserve the dividend and share repurchase policies of certain bhcs such as huntington are reviewed by the federal reserve through the ccar process based on capital plans and stress tests submitted by the bhc and are assessed against among other things the bhcs ability to meet and exceed minimum regulatory capital ratios under stressed scenarios its expected sources and uses of capital over the planning horizon under baseline and stressed scenarios and any potential impact of changes to its business plan and activities on its capital adequacy and liquidity the federal reserves capital planning rule includes a limitation on capital distributions to the extent that actual capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in the capital plan submission12table of contentsvolcker rulethe doddfrank act introduced restrictions to prohibit or restrict the ability of banking entities from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading and sponsoring of or investing in private equity and hedge funds the volcker rule the final regulations implementing the volcker rule were adopted by the regulatory agencies on december 10 2013 the volcker rule and final regulations contain a number of exceptions to the prohibition on proprietary trading and sponsoring or acquiring any ownership interest in private equity or hedge funds covered funds the volcker rule permits banking entities to engage in certain activities such as underwriting marketmaking and riskmitigation hedging and exempts from the definition of a covered fund certain entities such as whollyowned subsidiaries joint ventures and acquisitions vehicles as well as sec registered investment companies in addition the volcker rule limits certain types of transactions between a banking entity and any covered fund for which it serves as investment manager or investment advisor the final rules implementing the volcker rule extended the conformance period generally until july 21 2015 on december 18 2014 the federal reserve announced that it would give banking entities an additional one year until july 21 2016 to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds that were in place prior to december 31 2013 legacy covered funds on july 7 2016 the federal reserve granted banking entities an additional oneyear extension of the conformance period until july 21 2017 to conform ownership interests in and relationships to legacy covered funds in february 2017 the federal reserve approved our application for an extended transition period with respect to certain legacy illiquid fund investments on january 14 2014 the five federal agencies approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of the volcker rule under the interim final rule the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities if certain qualifications are met in addition the agencies released a nonexclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of the interim final rule at december 31 2016 we had investments in seven different pools of trust preferred securities six of our pools are included in the list of nonexclusive issuers we have analyzed the other pool that was not included on the list and believe that we will continue to be able to own this investment under the final volcker rule regulations as well resolution planningas a bhc with assets of 50 billion or more huntington is required to submit annually to the federal reserve and the fdic a plan for the orderly resolution of huntington and its significant legal entities under the us bankruptcy code or other applicable insolvency laws in a rapid and orderly fashion in the event of future material financial distress or failure a resolution plan if the federal reserve and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan is not credible and the deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner they may jointly impose on us more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth activities or operations in addition the fdic requires each insured depository institution with 50 billion or more in assets such the bank periodically to file a resolution plan with the fdic in july 2016 we were informed that the fdic extended the date for submission of the banks 2016 resolution plan to december 31 2017 in august 2016 we were informed that the federal reserve and the fdic also had extended the date for the submission of huntingtons 2016 resolution plan to december 31 2017 in each case we were informed that the submission of a resolution plan in 2017 will satisfy the 2016 resolution plan requirementon september 29 2016 the occ published final guidelines establishing standards for recovery planning by insured national banks with average total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more including the bank the final guidelines provide among other things that a covered bank should develop and maintain a recovery plan that is appropriate for its individual size risk profile activities and complexity including the complexity of its organizational and legal entity structure occ examiners will assess the appropriateness and adequacy of a covered banks ongoing recovery planning process as part of the agencys regular supervisory activities our compliance date is within 18 months from january 1 2017 source of strengthhuntington is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to the bank and to commit resources to support the bank this support may be required by the federal reserve at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of huntington or our stockholders or creditors the federal reserve may require a bhc to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bhc with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bhc fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the federal reserve believes might jeopardize the bhcs ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank13table of contentsprompt corrective actionfdicia requires federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action against banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements under this regime the fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on a banks operations management and capital distributions depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified for instance only a wellcapitalized bank may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval and an adequately capitalized bank may only do so with such prior approval under fdicia five capital levels or categories are established well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized these

each deposit account except as otherwise provided we will have three years after the effective date for implementation compensation our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the federal reserve and with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees by other financial regulatory bodies the scope and content of compensation regulation in the financial industry are continuing to develop and we expect that these regulations and resulting market practices will continue to evolve over a number of years the federal bank regulatory agencies have provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices the guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated as appropriate into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions the guidance also provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundnessin 2016 the federal banking regulatory agencies including the federal reserve the occ and the sec jointly proposed a rule to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 generally requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to jointly issue regulations or guidelines 1 prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements that the agencies determine encourage inappropriate risks by certain financial institutions by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss and 2 requiring those financial institutions to disclose information concerning incentivebased compensation arrangements to the appropriate federal regulatorcyber securitythe cisa which became effective on december 18 2015 is intended to improve cyber security in the united states by enhanced sharing of information about security threats among the us government and private sector entities including financial institutions the cisa also

cyber risk management standards on november 22 2016 the federal banking agencies released an anpr regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards enhanced standards for large and interconnected entities under their supervision the agencies stated that they were considering establishing enhanced standards to increase the operational resilience of covered entities and reduce the impact on the financial system in case of a cyber event experienced by a covered entity the anpr describes potential enhanced cyber standards that are divided into five general categories cyber risk governance cyber risk management internal dependency management external dependency management and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness the agencies are considering implementing the enhanced standards in a tiered manner imposing more stringent standards on the systems of those entities that are critical to the functioning of the financial sector the federal reserve is considering applying the enhanced standards on an enterprisewide basis to all bhcs such as us with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the occ is considering applying the standards to any national

its focus on fair lending practices of indirect automobile lenders this focus led to some lenders to enter into consent orders with the cfpb and department of justice indirect automobile lenders have also received continued pressure from the cfpb to limit or eliminate discretionary pricing by dealers finally the cfpb has implemented its larger participant rule for indirect automobile lending which brings larger nonbank indirect automobile lenders under cfpb supervisionbanking regulatory agencies have increasingly used their authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices by banks under standards developed many years ago by the federal trade commission in order to address practices that may not necessarily fall within the scope of a specific banking or consumer finance law the doddfrank act also gave to the cfpb similar authority to take action in connection with unfair

risk governancewe use a multifaceted approach to risk governance it begins with the board of directors defining our risk appetite as aggregate moderatetolow this does not preclude engagement in select higher risk activities rather the definition is intended to represent an aggregate view of where we want our overall risk to be managedthree board committees primarily oversee implementation of this desired risk appetite and monitoring of our risk profile the audit committee oversees the integrity of the consolidated financial statements including policies procedures and practices regarding the preparation of financial statements the financial reporting process disclosures and internal control over financial reporting the audit committee also provides assistance to the board in overseeing the internal audit division and the independent registered public accounting firms qualifications and independence compliance with our financial code of ethics for the chief executive officer and senior financial officers and compliance with corporate securities trading policiesthe risk oversight committee assists the board of directors in overseeing management of material risks the approval and monitoring of the companys capital position and plan supporting our overall aggregate moderatetolow risk profile the risk governance structure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and determining adherence to the boards stated risk appetite the committee has oversight responsibility with respect to the full range of inherent risks market credit liquidity legal complianceregulatory operational strategic and reputational this committee also oversees our capital management and planning process ensures that the amount and quality of capital are adequate in relation to expected and unexpected risks and that our capital levels exceed wellcapitalized requirements the technology committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to all technology cyber security and thirdparty risk management strategies and plans the committee is charged with evaluating huntingtons capability to properly perform all technology functions necessary for its business plan including projected growth technology capacity planning operational execution product development and management capacity the committee provides oversight of technology investments and plans to drive efficiency as well as to meet defined standards for risk security and redundancy the committee oversees the allocation of technology costs and ensures that they are understood by the board of directors the technology committee monitors and evaluates innovation and technology trends that may affect the companys strategic plans including monitoring of overall industry trends the technology committee reviews and provides oversight of the companys continuity and disaster recovery planning and preparednessthe audit and risk oversight committees routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and risk management on a periodic basis the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both such as the construct and appropriateness of the acl which is reviewed quarterly all directors have access to information provided to each committee and all scheduled meetings are open to all directorsfurther through its compensation committee the board of directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards is risksensitive and aligns the interests of management creditors and shareholders we utilize a variety of compensationrelated tools to induce appropriate behavior including common stock ownership thresholds for the chief executive officer and certain members of senior management a requirement to hold until retirement or exit from the company a portion of net shares received upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards 50 for executive officers and 25 for other award recipients equity deferrals recoupment provisions and the right to terminate compensation plans at any timemanagement has implemented an enterprise risk management and risk appetite framework critically important is our selfassessment process in which each business segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls the segment analyses are combined with assessments by our risk management organization of major risk sectors eg credit market liquidity operational legal compliance reputational and strategic to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment outcomes of the process include a determination of the quality of the overall control process the direction of risk and our position compared to the defined risk appetitemanagement also utilizes a wide series of metrics key risk indicators to monitor risk positions throughout the company in general a range for each metric is established which allows the company in aggregate to operate within an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile deviations from the range will indicate if the risk being measured exceeds desired tolerance which may then necessitate corrective actionwe also have four executive level committees to manage risk alco credit policy and strategy risk management and capital management each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature we believe this structure helps ensure appropriate escalation of issues and overall communication of strategies17table of contentshuntington utilizes three lines of defense with regard to risk management 1 business segments 2 corporate risk management and 3 internal audit and credit review to induce greater ownership of risk within its

produces the enterprise risk assessment the chief risk officer has significant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans as they apply to risk internal audit and credit review provide additional assurance that riskrelated functions are operating as intendedrisk overviewwe like other financial companies are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations many of which are outside of our direct control though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns among the risks assumed are credit risk which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms market risk which occurs when fluctuations in interest rates impact earnings and capital financial impacts are realized through changes in the interest rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities net interest margin or directly through valuation changes of capitalized msr andor trading assets noninterest income liquidity risk which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels liquidity risk also results from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the banks ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value operational and legal risk which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems human errors or misconduct or adverse external events operational losses result from internal fraud external fraud inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety failure to meet professional obligations involving customers products and business practices damage to physical assets business disruption and systems failures and failures in execution delivery and process management legal risk includes but is not limited to exposure to orders fines penalties or punitive damages resulting from litigation as well as regulatory actions compliance risk which exposes us to money penalties enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws rules and regulations that apply to the financial services industry andstrategic risk which is defined as risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or enterprise value arising from adverse business decisions improper implementation of business decisions or lack of responsiveness to industry  market changes we also expend considerable effort to protect our reputation reputation risk does not easily lend itself to traditional methods of measurement rather we closely monitor it through processes such as new product  initiative reviews colleague and client surveys monitoring media tone periodic discussions between management and our board and other such efforts in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report readers should carefully consider that the following important factors among others could negatively impact our business future results of operations and future cash flows materiallycredit risks1 our acl level may prove to be inappropriate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could adversely affect our net income and capitalour business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers our acl of 736 million at december 31 2016 represented managements estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we regularly review our acl for appropriateness in doing so we consider economic conditions and trends collateral values and credit quality indicators such as past chargeoff experience levels of past due loans and npas there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases if the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsin addition regulatory review of risk ratings and loan and lease losses may impact the level of the acl and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations18table of contents2 weakness in economic conditions could adversely affect our businessour performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us our customers and our counterparties these conditions could result in one or more of the followinga decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by usa decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us andan increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to usan increase in the number of delinquencies bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of npas ncos provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale the markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and thus are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectorsmarket risks1 changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income reduce transactional income and negatively impact the value of our loans securities and other assets this could have an adverse impact on our cash flows financial condition results of operations and capitalour results of operations depend substantially on net interest income which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions conditions such as inflation deflation recession unemployment money supply and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates if our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment net interest income could be materially adversely impacted likewise if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment net interest income could be adversely impacted changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans securities assets under management and other assets including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights an increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in npas and a reduction of income recognized which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows when we place a loan on nonaccrual status we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable which decreases interest income however we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding nals without any corresponding interest income in addition transactional income including trust income brokerage income and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from periodtoperiod based on a number of factors including the interest rate environment a decline in interest rates along with a flattening yield curve limits our ability to reprice deposits given the current historically low level of interest rates and could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixedrate securities and cash flow hedging derivatives portfolio any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts oci shareholders equity and the tangible common equity ratio any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios in a rising interest rate environment pension and other postretirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative oci impacts from securities and financial instruments for more information refer to market risk of the mdampacertain investment securities notably mortgagebacked securities are very sensitive to rising and falling rates generally when rates rise prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will increase conversely when rates fall prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will decrease in either case interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgagebacked securitiesmsr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be reduced by prepayments prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates risein addition to volatility associated with interest rates the company also has exposure to equity markets related to the investments within the benefit plans and other income from client based transactions 19table of contents2 industry competition may have an adverse effect on our successour profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully we operate in a highly competitive environment and we expect competition to intensify certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits in our market areas we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and therefore may have greater flexibility in competing for business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including customer convenience quality of service by investing in new products and services personal contacts pricing and range of products if we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in particular if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability or a desire to do business with our competitors we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin for more information refer to competition section of item 1 businessliquidity risks1 changes in either huntingtons financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidenceliquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost the bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers the board of directors establishes liquidity policies including contingency funding plans and limits and management establishes operating guidelines for liquidityour primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers the continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular the availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes eg changes in fdic insurance the liquidity coverage ratio etc and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits while we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding market related geopolitical or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits2 we are a holding company and depend on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds huntington is an entity separate and distinct from the bank the bank conducts most of our operations and huntington depends upon dividends from the bank to service huntingtons debt and to pay dividends to huntingtons shareholders the availability of dividends from the bank is limited by various statutes and regulations it is possible depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of the bank and other factors that the occ could limit the payment of dividends or other payments by the bank in addition the payment of dividends by our other subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiarys state of incorporation and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to such subsidiaries in the event that the bank was unable to pay dividends to us we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our preferred and common stock our failure to pay dividends on our preferred and common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock additional information regarding dividend restrictions is provided in item 1 regulatory matters3 if we lose access to capital markets we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors creditors and borrowers or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activitieswholesale funding sources include securitization federal funds purchased securities sold under repurchase agreements noncore deposits and longterm debt the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank of cincinnati which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgagerelated assets we maintain a portfolio

existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions20table of contents4 a reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to raise funds including capital andor the holders of our securitiesthe credit rating agencies regularly evaluate huntington and the bank and credit ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings as well as factors not entirely within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry the economy and changes in rating methodologies there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings a downgrade of the credit ratings of huntington or the bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities this could affect our growth profitability and financial condition including liquidityoperational and legal risks1 we face security risks including denial of service attacks hacking social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers malware intrusion or data corruption attempts and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information adversely affect our business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposureour computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyberattacks such as denial of service attacks hacking terrorist activities or identity theft financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyberattacks and other means denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions including us none of these events against us resulted in a breach of our client data or account information however the performance of our website wwwhuntingtoncom was adversely affected and in some instances customers were prevented from accessing our website we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future while events to date primarily resulted in inconvenience future cyberattacks could be more disruptive and damaging hacking and identity theft risks in particular could cause serious reputational harm cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or lossdespite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources time and motive the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources including outside groups such as external service providers organized crime affiliates terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applicationseven the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise targeted social engineering attacks and spear phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent the successful social engineer will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clientsa successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences including significant disruption of operations misappropriation of confidential information or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties a successful security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to us or to our customers loss of confidence in our security measures significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company2 the resolution of

related to the bankruptcy of cyberco holdings inc 21table of contents3 we face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and capital marketswe are exposed to many types of operational risks including the risk of fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders unauthorized transactions by colleagues or outsiders operational errors by colleagues business disruption and system failures huntington executes against a significant number of controls a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and thirdparty service providers there is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack these operational risks could lead to financial loss expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and the capital marketsmoreover negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including clients products and business practices corporate governance acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory actionrelative to acquisitions we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of employees accounting systems and technology platforms from acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions acquisitions may be subject to the receipt of approvals from certain governmental authorities including the federal reserve the occ and the united states department of justice as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire these approvals for acquisitions may not be received may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions subject to requisite regulatory approvals future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock which would dilute current shareholders ownership interests additionally acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction 4 failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock priceeffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures such controls and procedures are modified supplemented and changed from timetotime as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments any failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis which could result in regulatory actions loss of investor confidence and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price5 we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial valuesquantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including estimating probable loan losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk and for capital planning purposes including during the ccar capital planning and capital adequacy process our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses particularly in times of market distress and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code inaccurate data misuse of data or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the models designall models have certain limitations reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect missing or misleading information in addition our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable also information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleadingbanking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate including distributions to our shareholders could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient22table of contents6 we rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure we rely on thirdparty service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice provide enhanced products and services and reduce costs although there are benefits in entering into thirdparty relationships with vendors and others there are risks associated with such activities when entering a thirdparty relationship the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the thirdparty but remain our responsibility the technology committee of the board of directors provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with thirdparty relationships management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing thirdparty relationships management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships increased risk could occur based on poor planning oversight control and inferior performance or service on the part of the thirdparty and may result in legal costs or loss of business while we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of thirdparty service providers any problems caused by thirdparty service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business replacing a thirdparty service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses7 changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could affect how we report our financial condition and results of operationsthe fasb regulatory agencies and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements additionally those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operationsfor further discussion see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 8 impairment of goodwill could require charges to earnings which could result in a negative impact on our results of operationsour goodwill could become impaired in the future if goodwill were to become impaired it could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to huntington bancshares incorporated adversely impacting huntington bancshares incorporateds liquidity and ability to pay dividends or repay debt the most significant assumptions affecting our goodwill impairment evaluation are variables including the market price of our common stock projections of earnings and the control premium above our current stock price that an acquirer would pay to obtain control of us we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or when impairment indicators are present if an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period our earnings and book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment if an impairment loss is recorded it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our common stock or our regulatory capital levels but such an impairment loss could significantly reduce the banks earnings and thereby restrict the banks ability to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval because federal reserve policy states the bank holding company dividends should be paid from current earnings at december 31 2016 the book value of our goodwill was 20 billion all of which was recorded at the bank any such write down of goodwill or other acquisition related intangibles will reduce huntingtons earnings as well 9 negative publicity could damage our reputation and could significantly harm our business our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and highlyskilled management and employees is affected by our reputation public perception of the financial services industry in general was damaged as a result of the credit crisis that started in 2008 we face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the credit crisis and economic downturn significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources including employee misconduct actual or perceived unethical behavior conflicts of interest litigation gse or regulatory actions failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality failing to address customer and agency complaints compliance failures unauthorized release of confidential information due to cyberattacks or otherwise and the activities of our clients customers and counterparties including vendors actions by the financial service industry generally or by institutions or individuals in the industry can adversely affect our reputation indirectly by association all of these could adversely affect our growth results of operation and financial condition 23table of contentscompliance risks1 bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity including the annual ccar assessment process and the basel iii capital and liquidity standards could require higher levels of capital and liquidity among other things these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends repurchase common stock attract costeffective sources of deposits or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securitiesthe federal reserve administers the annual ccar an assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies with consolidated assets of 50 billion or more and of the practices used by covered banks to assess capital needs under ccar the federal reserve makes a qualitative assessment of capital adequacy on a forwardlooking basis and reviews the strength of a bank holding companys capital adequacy process the federal reserve also makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisoryrun stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a cet1 ratio of 45 after making all capital actions included in a bank holding companys capital plan under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a ninequarter planning horizon capital plans for 2017 are required to be submitted by april 5 2017 and the federal reserve will either object to the capital plan andor planned capital actions or provide a notice of nonobjection no later than june 30 2017 we intend to submit our capital plan to the federal reserve on or before april 5 2017 the bank also must submit a capital plan to the occ on or before april 5 2017 there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will respond favorably to our capital plan capital actions or stress test and the federal reserve occ or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including common stock dividends and stock repurchasesin 2013 the federal reserve and the occ adopted final rules to implement the basel iii capital rules for us banking organizations the final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the united states the basel iii regulatory capital reforms from the basel committee on banking supervision and certain changes required by the doddfrank act under the final rule minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations as a standardized approach institution the basel iii minimum capital requirements became effective for us on january 1 2015 and will be fully phasedin on january 1 2019on september 3 2014 the us banking regulators approved a final rule to implement a minimum lcr requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more and a less stringent modified lcr requirement to depository institution holding companies below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the lcr requires covered banking organizations to maintain hqla equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendarday stress scenario we are covered by the modified lcr requirement and therefore subject to the phasein of the rule which as of january 2017 is at 100 we will also be required to calculate the lcr monthly the lcr assigns less severe outflow assumptions to certain types of customer deposits which should increase the demand and perhaps the cost among banks for these deposits additionally the hqla requirements will increase the demand for direct us government and us government guaranteed debt that while high quality generally carry lower yields than other securities that banks hold in their investment portfolios2 if our regulators deem it appropriate they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results ability to compete for new business or preclude mergers or acquisitions in addition regulatory actions could constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends any of these

acquisitions limiting our ability to offer certain products or services or imposing additional capital requirementsunder the supervision of the cfpb our consumer products and services are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations we may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations enforcement actions and litigation in the future related to consumer practices thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions in addition increased regulatory inquiries and investigations as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments could result in significant loss of revenue require remuneration to our customers trigger fines or penalties limit the products or services we offer require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products impose additional compliance costs on us cause harm to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses24table of contents3 legislative and regulatory actions taken
