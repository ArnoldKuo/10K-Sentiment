issued interim final rules that were adopted as final rules in april 2014 to implement the basel iii capital accord as well as certain requirements of the doddfrank act the final capital rules made a number of significant changes to the regulatory capital ratios applicable to huntington and the bank as well as all other banks and bhcs of their size in addition the capital rules modified the types of capital instruments that may be included in regulatory capital and how certain assets are riskweighted for purposes of these calculationsunder the final capital rules huntington and the bank must maintain a minimum cet1 riskbased ratio a minimum tier i riskbased capital ratio a minimum total riskbased capital ratio and a minimum leverage ratio the final capital rules also limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonuses if a banking organization does not maintain certain capital ratios the preamble to the final capital rules states that these quantitative calculations are minimums and that the agencies may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to be operate in a safe and sound manner in addition the final capital rules generally provide that trust preferred securities and certain preferred securities no longer count as tier i capital banking organizations with more than 15 billion in total consolidated assets were required to phaseout of additional tier 1 capital any nonqualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred shares issued before september 12 2010 we have phased out the additional tier 1 capital treatment of our trust preferred securities but are including these instruments in tier 2 capital as allowed by

of failure we are expected to ensure the sustainability of our critical operations and banking offices under a broad range of internal or external stresses comprehensive capital analysis and review huntington is required to submit a capital plan annually to the federal reserve for supervisory review in connection with its annual ccar process huntington is required to include within its capital plan an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon a detailed description of the process for assessing capital adequacy its capital policy and a discussion of any expected changes to its business plan that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy the planning horizon for the most recently completed capital planning and stress testing cycle encompassed the ninequarter period from the first quarter of 2016 through the first quarter of 2018 currently the federal reserve may object to a bhcs capital plan based on either quantitative or qualitative grounds if the federal reserve objects to a bhcs capital plan the bhc may not make any capital distribution unless the federal reserve indicates in writing that it does not object to the distribution under ccar the federal reserve makes a qualitative assessment of capital adequacy on a forwardlooking basis and reviews the strength of a bhcs capital adequacy process the federal reserve also makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisoryrun stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above certain minimum ratios after taking all capital actions included in a bhcs capital plan under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a ninequarter planning horizon as part of ccar the federal reserve evaluates whether bhcs have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether they have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risksthe federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar such as huntington to have sufficient capital to withstand a highly adverse operating environment and to be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and serve as credit intermediaries in addition the federal reserve evaluates the planned capital actions of these bhcs including planned capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases we generally may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve and as to which the federal reserve has not objected in addition we are generally prohibited from making a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution we will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios 11table of contentson september 30 2016 the federal reserve issued a proposed rule to amend the capital plan and stress test rules for large and noncomplex bhcs such as huntington to provide among other things that beginning with the 2017 ccar cycle such bhcs would continue to submit a capital plan for quantitative assessment but would no longer be subject to a nonobjection from a qualitative aspect the federal reserve is proposing to evaluate the strength of a large and noncomplex companys qualitative capital planning process through the regular supervisory process and targeted horizontal reviews of particular aspects of capital planning a final rule implementing the changes described above was issued on february 3 2017huntington submitted its 2016 capital plan to the federal reserve in april 2016 the federal reserve did not object to huntingtons 2016 capital plan huntington is required and intends to submit to the federal reserve its capital plan for 2017 by april 5 2017 there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will respond favorably to huntingtons 2017 capital plan capital actions or stress test results stress testingthe doddfrank act requires a semiannual supervisory stress test of bhcs including huntington with 50 billion or more of total consolidated assets this doddfrank act supervisory stress testing is a forwardlooking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on bhc capital the doddfrank act also requires bhcs to conduct companyrun annual and semiannual stress tests the results of which are filed with the federal reserve and publicly disclosed a bhcs ability to make capital distributions is limited to the extent the bhcs actual capital levels are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan submission the doddfrank act also requires a national bank such as the bank with total consolidated assets of more than 10 billion to conduct annual companyrun stress tests the objective of the annual companyrun stress test is to ensure that covered institutions have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and to help ensure that institutions have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress a covered institution is required to publish a summary of the results of its annual stress tests liquidity coverage ratioon september 3 2014 the us banking regulators approved a final rule which became effective on january 1 2015 to implement a minimum lcr requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more and a less stringent modified lcr requirement to depository institution holding companies such as huntington below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the lcr requires covered banking organizations to maintain hqla equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendarday stress scenario huntington is covered by the modified lcr requirement and therefore subject to the phasein of the rule beginning january 2016 at 90 and january 2017 at 100 huntington is required to calculate the lcr monthly the lcr assigns less severe outflow assumptions to certain types of customer deposits which should increase the demand and perhaps the cost among banks for these deposits additionally the hqla requirements has increased the demand for direct us government and us governmentguaranteed debt that while high quality generally carry lower yields than other securities that banks hold in their investment portfoliosrestrictions on dividendsat the holding company level huntington relies on dividends distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries particularly the bank to fund the dividends paid to its shareholders as well as to satisfy its debt and other obligations certain federal and state statutes regulations and contractual restrictions limit the ability of our subsidiaries including the bank to pay dividends to us the occ has authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the bank if in the occs view payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank in addition huntingtons ability to pay dividends or return capital to its shareholders whether through an increase in common stock dividends or through a share repurchase program is subject to the oversight of the federal reserve the dividend and share repurchase policies of certain bhcs such as huntington are reviewed by the federal reserve through the ccar process based on capital plans and stress tests submitted by the bhc and are assessed against among other things the bhcs ability to meet and exceed minimum regulatory capital ratios under stressed scenarios its expected sources and uses of capital over the planning horizon under baseline and stressed scenarios and any potential impact of changes to its business plan and activities on its capital adequacy and liquidity the federal reserves capital planning rule includes a limitation on capital distributions to the extent that actual capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in the capital plan submission12table of contentsvolcker

relationships to legacy covered funds in february 2017 the federal reserve approved our application for an extended transition period with respect to certain legacy illiquid fund investments on january 14 2014 the five federal agencies approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of the volcker rule under the interim final rule the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities if certain qualifications are met in addition the agencies released a nonexclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of the interim final rule at december 31 2016 we had investments in seven different pools of trust preferred securities six of our pools are included in the list of nonexclusive issuers we have analyzed the other pool that was not included on the list and believe that we

the bank and to commit resources to support the bank this support may be required by the federal reserve at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of huntington or our stockholders or creditors the federal reserve may require a bhc to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bhc with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bhc fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the federal reserve believes might jeopardize the bhcs ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank13table of contentsprompt corrective actionfdicia requires federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action against banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements under this regime the fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on a banks operations management and capital distributions depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified for instance only a wellcapitalized bank may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval and an adequately capitalized bank may only do so with such prior approval under fdicia five capital levels or categories are established well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized these capital categories are determined solely for purposes of applying the prompt corrective action provisions and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of our overall financial condition or prospects an institution may be downgraded to or deemed to be in a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions as the capital category of an institution declines failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital ultimately critically

determined with reference to the banks regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it the doddfrank act expanded the coverage and scope of these regulations
