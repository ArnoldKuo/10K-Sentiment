capital requirementshuntington and the bank are subject to certain riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements the federal reserve establishes capital and leverage requirements for huntington and evaluates its compliance with such requirements the occ establishes similar capital and leverage requirements for the bank in 2013 the federal reserve and occ issued final rules and the fdic issued interim final rules that were adopted as final rules in april 2014 to implement the basel iii capital accord as well as certain requirements of the doddfrank act the final capital rules made a number of significant changes to the regulatory capital ratios applicable to huntington and the bank as well as all other banks and bhcs of their size in addition the capital rules modified the types of capital instruments that may be included in regulatory capital and how certain assets are riskweighted for purposes of these calculationsunder the final capital rules huntington and the bank must maintain a minimum cet1 riskbased ratio a minimum tier i riskbased capital ratio a minimum total riskbased capital ratio and a minimum leverage ratio the final capital rules also limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonuses if a banking organization does not maintain certain capital ratios the preamble to the final capital rules states that these quantitative calculations are minimums and that the agencies may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to be operate in a safe and sound manner in addition the final capital rules generally provide that trust preferred securities and certain preferred securities no longer count as tier i capital banking organizations with more than 15 billion in total consolidated assets were required to phaseout of additional tier 1 capital any nonqualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred shares issued before september 12 2010 we have phased out the additional tier 1 capital treatment of our trust preferred securities but are including these instruments in tier 2 capital as allowed by

with consolidated assets of more than 50 billion such as huntington are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements as a result huntington is subject to more stringent standards and requirements including liquidity and capital requirements leverage limits stress testing risk management standards than those applicable to smaller institutions with regard to resiliency we are expected to ensure that the consolidated organization and its core business lines can survive under a broad range of internal or external stresses this requires financial resilience by maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity and operational resilience by maintaining effective corporate governance risk management and recovery planning with respect to lowering the probability of failure we are expected to ensure the sustainability of our critical operations and banking offices under a broad range of internal or external stresses comprehensive capital analysis and review huntington is required to submit a capital plan annually to the federal reserve for supervisory review in connection with its annual ccar process huntington is required to include within its capital plan an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon a detailed description of the process for assessing capital adequacy its capital policy and a discussion of any expected changes to its business plan that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy the planning horizon for the most recently completed capital planning and stress testing cycle encompassed the ninequarter period from the first quarter of 2016 through the first quarter of 2018 currently the federal reserve may object to a bhcs capital plan based on either quantitative or qualitative grounds if the federal reserve objects to a bhcs capital plan the bhc may not make any capital distribution unless the federal reserve indicates in writing that it does not object to the distribution under ccar the federal reserve makes a qualitative assessment of capital adequacy on a forwardlooking basis and reviews the strength of a bhcs capital adequacy process the federal reserve also makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisoryrun stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above certain minimum ratios after taking all capital actions included in a bhcs capital plan under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a ninequarter planning horizon as part of ccar the federal reserve evaluates whether bhcs have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether they have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risksthe federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar such as huntington to have sufficient capital to withstand a highly adverse operating environment and to be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and serve as credit intermediaries in addition the federal reserve evaluates the planned capital actions of these bhcs including planned capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases we generally may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve and as to which the federal reserve has not objected in addition we are generally prohibited from making a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution we will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios 11table of contentson september 30 2016 the federal reserve issued a proposed rule to amend the capital plan and stress test rules for large and noncomplex bhcs such as huntington to provide among other things that beginning with the 2017 ccar cycle such bhcs would continue to submit a capital plan for quantitative assessment but would no longer be subject to a nonobjection from a qualitative aspect the federal reserve is proposing to evaluate the strength of a large and noncomplex companys qualitative capital planning process through the regular supervisory process and targeted horizontal reviews of particular aspects of capital planning a final rule implementing the changes described above was issued on february 3 2017huntington submitted its 2016 capital plan to the federal reserve in april 2016 the federal reserve did not object to huntingtons 2016 capital plan huntington is required and intends to submit to the federal reserve its capital plan for 2017 by april 5 2017 there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will respond favorably to huntingtons 2017 capital plan capital actions or stress test results stress testingthe doddfrank act requires a semiannual supervisory stress test of bhcs including huntington with 50 billion or more of total consolidated assets this doddfrank act supervisory stress testing is a forwardlooking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on bhc capital the doddfrank act also requires bhcs to conduct companyrun annual and semiannual stress tests the results of which are filed with the federal reserve and publicly disclosed a bhcs ability to make capital distributions is limited to the extent the bhcs actual capital levels are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan submission the doddfrank act also requires a national bank such as the bank with total consolidated assets of more than 10 billion to conduct annual companyrun stress tests the objective of the annual companyrun stress test is to ensure that covered institutions have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and to help ensure that institutions have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress a covered institution is required to publish a summary of the results of its annual stress tests liquidity coverage ratioon september 3 2014 the us banking regulators approved a final rule which became effective on january 1 2015 to implement a minimum lcr requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more and a less stringent modified lcr requirement to depository institution holding companies such as huntington below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the lcr requires covered banking organizations to maintain hqla equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendarday stress scenario huntington is covered by the modified lcr requirement and therefore subject to the phasein of the rule beginning january 2016 at 90 and january 2017 at 100 huntington is required to calculate the lcr monthly the lcr assigns less severe outflow assumptions to certain types of customer deposits which should increase the demand and perhaps the cost among banks for these deposits additionally the hqla requirements has increased the demand for direct us government and us governmentguaranteed debt that while high quality generally carry lower yields than other securities that banks hold in their investment portfoliosrestrictions on dividendsat the holding company level huntington relies on dividends distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries particularly the bank to fund the dividends paid to its shareholders as well as to satisfy its debt and other obligations certain federal and state statutes regulations and contractual restrictions limit the ability of our subsidiaries including the bank to pay dividends to us the occ has authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the bank if in the occs view payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank in addition huntingtons ability to pay dividends or return capital to its shareholders whether through an increase in common stock dividends or through a share repurchase program is subject to the oversight of the federal reserve the dividend and share repurchase policies of certain bhcs such as huntington are reviewed by the federal reserve through the ccar process based on capital plans and stress tests submitted by the bhc and are assessed against among other things the bhcs ability to meet and exceed minimum regulatory capital ratios under stressed scenarios its expected sources and uses of capital over the planning horizon under baseline and stressed scenarios and any potential impact of changes to its business plan and activities on its capital adequacy and liquidity the federal reserves capital planning rule includes a limitation on capital distributions to the extent that actual capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in the capital plan submission12table of contentsvolcker rulethe doddfrank act introduced restrictions to prohibit or restrict the ability of banking entities from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading and sponsoring of or investing in private equity and hedge funds the volcker rule the final regulations implementing the volcker rule were adopted by the regulatory agencies on december 10 2013 the volcker rule and final regulations contain a number of exceptions to the prohibition on proprietary trading and sponsoring or acquiring any ownership interest in private equity or hedge funds covered funds the volcker rule permits banking entities to engage in certain activities such as underwriting marketmaking and riskmitigation hedging and exempts from the definition of a covered fund certain entities such as whollyowned subsidiaries joint ventures and acquisitions vehicles as well as sec registered investment companies in addition the volcker rule limits certain types of transactions between a banking entity and any covered fund for which it serves as investment manager or investment advisor the final rules implementing the volcker rule extended the conformance period generally until july 21 2015 on december 18 2014 the federal reserve announced that it would give banking entities an additional one year until july 21 2016 to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds that were in place prior to december 31 2013 legacy covered funds on july 7 2016 the federal reserve granted banking entities an additional oneyear extension of the conformance period until july 21 2017 to conform ownership interests in and relationships to legacy covered funds in february 2017 the federal reserve approved our application for an extended transition period with respect to certain legacy illiquid fund investments on january 14 2014 the five federal agencies approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of the volcker rule under the interim final rule the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities if certain qualifications are met in addition the agencies released a nonexclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of the interim final rule at december 31 2016 we had investments in seven different pools of trust preferred securities six of our pools are included in the list of nonexclusive issuers we have analyzed the other pool that was not included on the list and believe that we will continue to be able to own this investment under the final volcker rule regulations as well resolution planningas a bhc with assets of 50 billion or more huntington is required to submit annually to the federal reserve and the fdic a plan for the orderly resolution of huntington and its significant legal entities under the us bankruptcy code or other applicable insolvency laws in a rapid and orderly fashion in the event of future material financial distress or failure a resolution plan if the federal reserve and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan is not credible and the deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner they may jointly impose on us more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth activities or operations in addition the fdic requires each insured depository institution with 50 billion or more in assets such the bank periodically to file a resolution plan with the fdic in july 2016 we were informed that the fdic extended the date for submission of the banks 2016 resolution plan to december 31 2017 in august 2016 we were informed that the federal reserve and the fdic also had extended the date for the submission of huntingtons 2016 resolution plan to december 31 2017 in each case we were informed that the submission of a resolution plan in 2017 will satisfy the 2016 resolution plan requirementon september 29 2016 the occ published final guidelines establishing standards for recovery planning by insured national banks with average total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more including the bank the final guidelines provide among other things that a covered bank should develop and maintain a recovery plan that is appropriate for its individual size risk profile activities and complexity including the complexity of its organizational and legal entity structure occ examiners will assess the appropriateness and adequacy of a covered banks ongoing recovery planning process as part of the agencys regular supervisory activities our compliance date is within 18 months from january 1 2017 source of strengthhuntington is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to the bank and to commit resources to support the bank this support may be required by the federal reserve at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of huntington or our stockholders or creditors the federal reserve may require a bhc to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bhc with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bhc fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the federal reserve believes might jeopardize the bhcs ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank13table of contentsprompt corrective actionfdicia requires federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action against banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements under this regime the fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on a banks operations management and capital distributions depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified for instance only a wellcapitalized bank may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval and an adequately capitalized bank may only do so with such prior approval under fdicia five capital levels or categories are established well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized these capital categories are determined solely for purposes of applying the prompt corrective action provisions and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of our overall financial condition or prospects an institution may be downgraded to or deemed to be in a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions as the capital category of an institution declines failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital ultimately critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservatorupon the insolvency of an insured depository institution such as the bank the fdic may be appointed as the

reserve and with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees by other financial regulatory bodies the scope and content of compensation regulation in the financial industry are continuing to develop and we expect that these regulations and resulting market practices will continue to evolve over a number of years the federal bank regulatory agencies have provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices the guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated as appropriate into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions the guidance also provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundnessin 2016 the federal banking regulatory agencies including the federal reserve the occ and the sec jointly proposed a rule to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 generally requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to jointly issue regulations or guidelines 1 prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements that the agencies determine encourage inappropriate risks by certain financial institutions by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss and 2 requiring those financial institutions to disclose information concerning incentivebased compensation arrangements to the appropriate federal regulatorcyber securitythe cisa which became effective on december 18 2015 is intended to improve cyber security in the united states by enhanced sharing of information about security threats among the us government and private sector entities including financial institutions the cisa also

cyber risk management standards on november 22 2016 the federal banking agencies released an anpr regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards enhanced standards for large and interconnected entities under their supervision the agencies stated that they were considering establishing enhanced standards to increase the operational resilience of covered entities and reduce the impact on the financial system in case of a cyber event experienced by a covered entity the anpr describes potential enhanced cyber standards that are divided into five general categories cyber risk governance cyber risk management internal dependency management external dependency management and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness the agencies are considering implementing the enhanced standards in a tiered manner imposing more stringent standards on the systems of those entities that are critical to the functioning of the financial sector the federal reserve is considering applying the enhanced standards on an enterprisewide basis to all bhcs such as us with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the occ is considering applying the standards to any national

its focus on fair lending practices of indirect automobile lenders this focus led to some lenders to enter into consent orders with the cfpb and department of justice indirect automobile lenders have also received continued pressure from the cfpb to limit or eliminate discretionary pricing by dealers finally the cfpb has implemented its larger participant rule for indirect automobile lending which brings larger nonbank indirect automobile lenders under cfpb supervisionbanking regulatory agencies have increasingly used their authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices by banks under standards developed many years ago by the federal trade commission in order to address practices that may not necessarily fall within the scope of a specific banking or consumer finance law the doddfrank act also gave to the cfpb similar authority to take action in connection with unfair

risk governancewe use a multifaceted approach to risk governance it begins with the board of directors defining our risk appetite as aggregate moderatetolow this does not preclude engagement in select higher risk activities rather the definition is intended to represent an aggregate view of where we want our overall risk to be managedthree board committees primarily oversee implementation of this desired risk appetite and monitoring of our risk profile the audit committee oversees the integrity of the consolidated financial statements including policies procedures and practices regarding the preparation of financial statements the financial reporting process disclosures and internal control over financial reporting the audit committee also provides assistance to the board in overseeing the internal audit division and the independent registered public accounting firms qualifications and independence compliance with our financial code of ethics for the chief executive officer and senior financial officers and compliance with corporate securities trading policiesthe risk oversight committee assists the board of directors in overseeing management of material risks the approval and monitoring of the companys capital position and plan supporting our overall aggregate moderatetolow risk profile the risk governance structure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and determining adherence to the boards stated risk appetite the committee has oversight responsibility with respect to the full range of inherent risks market credit liquidity legal complianceregulatory operational strategic and reputational this committee also oversees our capital management and planning process ensures that the amount and quality of capital are adequate in relation to expected and unexpected risks and that our capital levels exceed wellcapitalized requirements the technology committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to all technology cyber security and thirdparty risk management strategies and plans the committee is charged with evaluating huntingtons capability to properly perform all technology functions necessary for its business plan including projected growth technology capacity planning operational execution product development and management capacity the committee provides oversight of technology investments and plans to drive efficiency as well as to meet defined standards for risk security and redundancy the committee oversees the allocation of technology costs and ensures that they are understood by the board of directors the technology committee monitors and evaluates innovation and technology trends that may affect the companys strategic plans including monitoring of overall industry trends the technology committee reviews and provides oversight of the companys continuity and disaster recovery planning and preparednessthe audit and risk oversight committees routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and risk management on a periodic basis the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both such as the construct and appropriateness of the acl which is reviewed quarterly all directors have access to information provided to each committee and all scheduled meetings are open to all directorsfurther through its compensation committee the board of directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards is risksensitive and aligns the interests of management creditors and shareholders we utilize a variety of compensationrelated tools to induce appropriate behavior including common stock ownership thresholds for the chief executive officer and certain members of senior management a requirement to hold until retirement or exit from the company a portion of net shares received upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards 50 for executive officers and 25 for other award recipients equity deferrals recoupment provisions and the right to terminate compensation plans at any timemanagement has implemented an enterprise risk management and risk appetite framework critically important is our selfassessment process in which each business segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls the segment analyses are combined with assessments by our risk management organization of major risk sectors eg credit market liquidity operational legal compliance reputational and strategic to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment outcomes of the process include a determination of the quality of the overall control process the direction of risk and our position compared to the defined risk appetitemanagement also utilizes a wide series of metrics key risk indicators to monitor risk positions throughout the company in general a range for each metric is established which allows the company in aggregate to operate within an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile deviations from the range will indicate if the risk being measured exceeds desired tolerance which may then necessitate corrective actionwe also have four executive level committees to manage risk alco credit policy and strategy risk management and capital management each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature we believe this structure helps ensure appropriate escalation of issues and overall communication of strategies17table of contentshuntington utilizes three lines of defense with regard to risk management 1 business segments 2 corporate risk management and 3 internal audit and credit review to induce greater ownership of risk within its

produces the enterprise risk assessment the chief risk officer has significant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans as they apply to risk internal audit and credit review provide additional assurance that riskrelated functions are operating as intendedrisk overviewwe like other financial companies are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations many of which are outside of our direct control though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns among the risks assumed are credit risk which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms market risk which occurs when fluctuations in interest rates impact earnings and capital financial impacts are realized through changes in the interest rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities net interest margin or directly through valuation changes of capitalized msr andor trading assets noninterest income liquidity risk which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels liquidity risk also results from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the banks ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value operational and legal risk which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems human errors or misconduct or adverse external events operational losses result from internal fraud external fraud inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety failure to meet professional obligations involving customers products and business practices damage to physical assets business disruption and systems failures and failures in execution delivery and process management legal risk includes but is not limited to exposure to orders fines penalties or punitive damages resulting from litigation as well as regulatory actions compliance risk which exposes us to money penalties enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws rules and regulations that apply to the financial services industry andstrategic risk which is defined as risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or enterprise value arising from adverse business decisions improper implementation of business decisions or lack of responsiveness to industry  market changes we also expend considerable effort to protect our reputation reputation risk does not easily lend itself to traditional methods of measurement rather we closely monitor it through processes such as new product  initiative reviews colleague and client surveys monitoring media tone periodic discussions between management and our board and other such efforts in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report readers should carefully consider that the following important factors among others could negatively impact our business future results of operations and future cash flows materiallycredit risks1 our acl level may prove to be inappropriate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could adversely affect our net income and capitalour business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers our acl of 736 million at december 31 2016 represented managements estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we regularly review our acl for appropriateness in doing so we consider economic conditions and trends collateral values and credit quality indicators such as past chargeoff experience levels of past due loans and npas there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases if the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsin addition regulatory review of risk ratings and loan and lease losses may impact the level of the acl and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations18table of contents2 weakness in economic conditions could adversely affect our businessour performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us our customers and our counterparties these conditions could result in one or more of the followinga decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by usa decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us andan increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to usan increase in the number of delinquencies bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of npas ncos provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale the markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and thus are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectorsmarket risks1 changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income reduce transactional income and negatively impact the value of our loans securities and other assets this could have an adverse impact on our cash flows financial condition results of operations and capitalour results of operations depend substantially on net interest income which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions conditions such as inflation deflation recession unemployment money supply and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates if our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment net interest income could be materially adversely impacted likewise if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment net interest income could be adversely impacted changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans securities assets under management and other assets including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights an increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in npas and a reduction of income recognized which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows when we place a loan on nonaccrual status we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable which decreases interest income however we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding nals without any corresponding interest income in addition transactional income including trust income brokerage income and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from periodtoperiod based on a number of factors including the interest rate environment a decline in interest rates along with a flattening yield curve limits our ability to reprice deposits given the current historically low level of interest rates and could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixedrate securities and cash flow hedging derivatives portfolio any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts oci shareholders equity and the tangible common equity ratio any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios in a rising interest rate environment pension and other postretirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative oci impacts from securities and financial instruments for more information refer to market risk of the mdampacertain investment securities notably mortgagebacked securities are very sensitive to rising and falling rates generally when rates rise prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will increase conversely when rates fall prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will decrease in either case interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgagebacked securitiesmsr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be reduced by prepayments prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates risein addition to volatility associated with interest rates the company also has exposure to equity markets related to the investments within the benefit plans and other income from client based transactions 19table of contents2 industry competition may have an adverse effect on our successour profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully we operate in a highly competitive environment and we expect competition to intensify certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits in our market areas we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and therefore may have greater flexibility in competing for business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including customer convenience quality of service by investing in new products and services personal contacts pricing and range of products if we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in particular if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability or a desire to do business with our competitors we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin for more information refer to competition section of item 1 businessliquidity risks1 changes in either huntingtons financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidenceliquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost the bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers the board of directors establishes liquidity policies including contingency funding plans and limits and management establishes operating guidelines for liquidityour primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers the continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular the availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes eg changes in fdic insurance the liquidity coverage ratio etc and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits while we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding market related geopolitical or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits2 we are a holding company and depend on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds huntington is an entity separate and distinct from the bank the bank conducts most of our operations and huntington depends upon dividends from the bank to service huntingtons debt and to pay dividends to huntingtons shareholders the availability of dividends from the bank is limited by various statutes and regulations it is possible depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of the bank and other factors that the occ could limit the payment of dividends or other payments by the bank in addition the payment of dividends by our other subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiarys state of incorporation and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to such subsidiaries in the event that the bank was unable to pay dividends to us we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our preferred and common stock our failure to pay dividends on our preferred and common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock additional information regarding dividend restrictions is provided in item 1 regulatory matters3 if we lose access to capital markets we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors creditors and borrowers or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activitieswholesale funding sources include securitization federal funds purchased securities sold under repurchase agreements noncore deposits and longterm debt the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank of cincinnati which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgagerelated assets we maintain a portfolio of highlyrated marketable securities that is available as a source of liquiditycapital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of huntington and the bank the inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations cash flows and level of regulatoryqualifying capital we may from timetotime consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions20table of contents4 a reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to raise funds including capital andor the holders of our securitiesthe credit rating agencies regularly evaluate huntington and the bank and credit ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings as well as factors not entirely within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry the economy and changes in rating methodologies there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings a downgrade of the credit ratings of huntington or the bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities this could affect our growth profitability and financial condition including liquidityoperational and legal risks1 we face security risks including denial of service attacks hacking social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers malware intrusion or data corruption attempts and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information adversely affect our business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposureour computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyberattacks such as denial of service attacks hacking terrorist activities or identity theft financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyberattacks and other means denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions including us none of these events against us resulted in a breach of our client data or account information however the performance of our website wwwhuntingtoncom was adversely affected and in some instances customers were prevented from accessing our website we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future while events to date primarily resulted in inconvenience future cyberattacks could be more disruptive and damaging hacking and identity theft risks in particular could cause serious reputational harm cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or lossdespite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources time and motive the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources including outside groups such as external service providers organized crime affiliates terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applicationseven the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise targeted social engineering attacks and spear phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent the successful social engineer will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clientsa successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences including significant disruption of operations misappropriation of confidential information or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties a successful security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to us or to our customers loss of confidence in our security measures significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company2 the resolution of significant pending litigation if unfavorable could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular periodwe face legal risks in our businesses and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters if unfavorable may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting periodnote 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements updates the status of certain material litigation including litigation related to the bankruptcy of cyberco holdings inc 21table of contents3 we face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and capital marketswe are exposed to many types of operational risks including the risk of fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders unauthorized transactions by colleagues or outsiders operational errors by colleagues business disruption and system failures huntington executes against a significant number of controls a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and thirdparty service providers there is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack these operational risks could lead to financial loss expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and the capital marketsmoreover negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including clients products and business practices corporate governance acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory actionrelative to acquisitions we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of employees accounting systems and technology platforms from acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions acquisitions may be subject to the receipt of approvals from certain governmental authorities including the federal reserve the occ and the united states department of justice as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire these approvals for acquisitions may not be received may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions subject to requisite regulatory approvals future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock which would dilute current shareholders ownership interests additionally acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction 4 failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock priceeffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures such controls and procedures are modified supplemented and changed from timetotime as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments any failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis which could result in regulatory actions loss of investor confidence and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price5 we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial valuesquantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including estimating probable loan losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk and for capital planning purposes including during the ccar capital planning and capital adequacy process our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses particularly in times of market distress and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code inaccurate data misuse of data or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the models designall models have certain limitations reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect missing or misleading information in addition our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable also information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleadingbanking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate including distributions to our shareholders could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient22table of contents6 we rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure we rely on thirdparty service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice provide enhanced products and services and reduce costs although there are benefits in entering into thirdparty relationships with vendors and others there are risks associated with such activities when entering a thirdparty relationship the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the thirdparty but remain our responsibility the technology committee of the board of directors provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with thirdparty relationships management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing thirdparty relationships management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships increased risk could occur based on poor planning oversight control and inferior performance or service on the part of the thirdparty and may result in legal costs or loss of business while we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of thirdparty service providers any problems caused by thirdparty service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business replacing a thirdparty service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses7 changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could affect how we report our financial condition and results of operationsthe fasb regulatory agencies and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements additionally those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operationsfor further discussion see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 8 impairment of goodwill could require charges to earnings which could result in a negative impact on our results of operationsour goodwill could become impaired in the future if goodwill were to become impaired it could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to huntington bancshares incorporated adversely impacting huntington bancshares incorporateds liquidity and ability to pay dividends or repay debt the most significant assumptions affecting our goodwill impairment evaluation are variables including the market price of our common stock projections of earnings and the control premium above our current stock price that an acquirer would pay to obtain control of us we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or when impairment indicators are present if an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period our earnings and book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment if an impairment loss is recorded it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our common stock or our regulatory capital levels but such an impairment loss could significantly reduce the banks earnings and thereby restrict the banks ability to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval because federal reserve policy states the bank holding company dividends should be paid from current earnings at december 31 2016 the book value of our goodwill was 20 billion all of which was recorded at the bank any such write down of goodwill or other acquisition related intangibles will reduce huntingtons earnings as well 9 negative publicity could damage our reputation and could significantly harm our business our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and highlyskilled management and employees is affected by our reputation public perception of the financial services industry in general was damaged as a result of the credit crisis that started in 2008 we face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the credit crisis and economic downturn significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources including employee misconduct actual or perceived unethical behavior conflicts of interest litigation gse or regulatory actions failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality failing to address customer and agency complaints compliance failures unauthorized release of confidential information due to cyberattacks or otherwise and the activities of our clients customers and counterparties including vendors actions by the financial service industry generally or by institutions or individuals in the industry can adversely affect our reputation indirectly by association all of these could adversely affect our growth results of operation and financial condition 23table of contentscompliance risks1 bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity including the annual ccar assessment process and the basel iii capital and liquidity standards could require higher levels of capital and liquidity among other things these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends repurchase common stock attract costeffective sources of deposits or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securitiesthe federal reserve administers the annual ccar an assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies with consolidated assets of 50 billion or more and of the practices used by covered banks to assess capital needs under ccar the federal reserve makes a qualitative assessment of capital adequacy on a forwardlooking basis and reviews the strength of a bank holding companys capital adequacy process the federal reserve also makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisoryrun stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a cet1 ratio of 45 after making all capital actions included in a bank holding companys capital plan under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a ninequarter planning horizon capital plans for 2017 are required to be submitted by april 5 2017 and the federal reserve will either object to the capital plan andor planned capital actions or provide a notice of nonobjection no later than june 30 2017 we intend to submit our capital plan to the federal reserve on or before april 5 2017 the bank also must submit a capital plan to the occ on or before april 5 2017 there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will respond favorably to our capital plan capital actions or stress test and the federal reserve occ or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including common stock dividends and stock repurchasesin 2013 the federal reserve and the occ adopted final rules to implement the basel iii capital rules for us banking organizations the final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the united states the basel iii regulatory capital reforms from the basel committee on banking supervision and certain changes required by the doddfrank act under the final rule minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations as a standardized approach institution the basel iii minimum capital requirements became effective for us on january 1 2015 and will be fully phasedin on january 1 2019on september 3 2014 the us banking regulators approved a final rule to implement a minimum lcr requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more and a less stringent modified lcr requirement to depository institution holding companies below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the lcr requires covered banking organizations to maintain hqla equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendarday stress scenario we are covered by the modified lcr requirement and therefore subject to the phasein of the rule which as of january 2017 is at 100 we will also be required to calculate the lcr monthly the lcr assigns less severe outflow assumptions to certain types of customer deposits which should increase the demand and perhaps the cost among banks for these deposits additionally the hqla requirements will increase the demand for direct us government and us government guaranteed debt that while high quality generally carry lower yields than other securities that banks hold in their investment portfolios2 if our regulators deem it appropriate they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results ability to compete for new business or preclude mergers or acquisitions in addition regulatory actions could constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends any of these actions could increase the cost of our services we are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators including the occ federal reserve fdic sec cfpb financial industry regulatory authority and various state regulatory agencies as such we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations many of which are discussed in item 1 regulatory matters as part of their supervisory process which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways including charging monetary fines impacting our ability to pay dividends precluding mergers or acquisitions limiting our ability to offer certain products or services or imposing additional capital requirementsunder the supervision of the cfpb our consumer products and services are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations we may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations enforcement actions and litigation in the future related to consumer practices thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions in addition increased regulatory inquiries and investigations as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments could result in significant loss of revenue require remuneration to our customers trigger fines or penalties limit the products or services we offer require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products impose additional compliance costs on us cause harm to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses24table of contents3 legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs adding complexity in doing business impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets requiring us to increase our regulatory capital limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities and otherwise resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operation liquidity or stock pricethe doddfrank act was a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states established the cfpb and required the cfpb and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations compliance with these new laws and regulations have and will continue to result in additional costs which could be significant and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations in addition if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to our consumer operations we may be subject to fines penalties or judgments or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses which could adversely affect operations and in turn financial results 4 we may become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and activity restrictions if the federal reserve and fdic determine that our resolution plan is not credible the doddfrank act and implementing regulations jointly issued by federal reserve and the fdic require bank holding companies with more than 50 billion in assets to annually submit a resolution plan to the federal reserve and the fdic that in the event of material financial distress or failure establish the rapid orderly resolution of the company under the us bankruptcy code if the federal reserve and the fdic jointly determine that our 2015 resolution plan is not credible we could become subjected to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions or restrictions on our growth activities or operations and could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations in ways that could negatively impact its operations and strategy 5 our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our financial holding company statusin order for us to maintain our status as a financial holding company we and the bank must remain well capitalized and well managed if we or our bank cease to meet the requirements necessary for us to continue to qualify as a financial holding company the federal reserve may impose upon us corrective capital and managerial requirements and may place limitations on our ability to conduct all of the business activities that we conduct as a financial holding company if the failure to meet these standards persists we could be required to divest our bank or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies in addition our ability to commence or engage in certain activities as a financial holding company will be restricted if the bank fails to

forwardlooking statements and those set forth in item 1aexecutive overviewbusiness combinationson august 16 2016 huntington completed its acquisition of firstmerit corporation in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately 37 billion firstmerit corporation was a diversified financial services company headquartered in akron ohio with operations in ohio michigan wisconsin illinois and pennsylvania post acquisition huntington now operates across an eightstate midwestern footprint the acquisition resulted in a combined company with a larger market presence and more diversified loan portfolio as well as a larger core deposit funding base and economies of scale associated with a larger financial institution for further discussion see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements2016 financial performance reviewin 2016 we reported net income of 712 million a 3 increase from the prior year earnings per common share on a diluted basis for the year was 070 down 14 from the prior year reported net income was impacted by firstmerit acquisition related expenses totaling 282 million pretax or 020 per common share and a reduction to the litigation reserve totaling 42 million pretax or 003 per common share fullytaxable equivalent net interest income was 24 billion up 04 billion or 22 this reflected the impact of 21 earning asset growth 22 interestbearing liability growth and a 1 basis point increase in the nim to 316 the average earning asset growth included an 88 billion or 18 increase in average loans and leases and a 41 billion or 30 increase in average securities both of which were impacted by the firstmerit acquisition the net interest margin expansion reflected a 9 basis point positive impact from the mix and yield on earning assets a 3 basis point increase in the benefit from noninterestbearing funds partially offset by an 11 basis point increase in funding costs the provision for credit losses was 191 million up 91 million or 91 the higher provision expense was due to several factors including the migration of the acquired portfolio to the originated portfolio and the corresponding reserve build portfolio growth and transitioning the firstmerit portfolio to huntingtons reserving methodology net chargeoffs represented an annualized 019 of average loans and leases which remains below our longterm target of 35 to 55 basis points noninterest income was 11 billion up 111 million or 11 service charges on deposit accounts increased 44 million or 16 reflecting the benefit of continued new customer acquisition in addition cards and payment processing income increased 26 million or 18 due to higher card related income and underlying customer growth also mortgage banking income increased 16 million or 15 reflecting a 24 increase in mortgage origination volume finally gain on sale of loans increased 14 million or 43 primarily reflecting an increase of 6 million in sba loan sales gains and the 7 million gains on nonrelationship campi and cre loan sales both of which were related to the balance sheet optimization strategy completed in the 2016 fourth quarter noninterest expense was 24 billion up 433 million or 22 reported noninterest expense was impacted by firstmerit acquisitionrelated expenses totaling 282 million personnel costs increased 227 million or 20 primarily reflecting 76 million of acquisitionrelated expense and a 31 increase in the number of average fulltime equivalent employees largely related to the instore branch expansion and the addition of colleagues from firstmerit in addition outside data processing and other services professional services equipment expense and net occupancy expense all increased as a result of acquisitionrelated expenses also other expense decreased 17 million or 8 primarily reflecting a 42 million reduction to litigation reserves which was mostly offset by a 40 million contribution in the 2016 fourth quarter to achieve the philanthropic plans related to firstmerit 30table of contentsthe tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 716 down 66 basis points the cet1 riskbased capital ratio was 956 down 23 basis points the regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital ratio was 1092 up 39 basis points all capital ratios were impacted by the 13 billion of goodwill created and the issuance of 28 billion of common stock as part of the firstmerit acquisition the regulatory tier 1 riskbased and total riskbased capital ratios benefited from the issuance of 600 million of class d preferred equity and separately the issuance of 100 million of class c preferred equity in exchange for firstmerit preferred equity in conjunction with the acquisition the total riskbased capital ratio was impacted by the repurchase of 65 million of trust preferred securities in addition 5 million of trust preferred securities acquired in the firstmerit acquisition were subsequently redeemed there were no common shares repurchased during 2016business overviewgeneralour general business objectives are 1 grow net interest income and fee income 2 deliver positive operating leverage 3 increase primary relationships across all business segments 4

is the difference between interest income from earning assets primarily loans securities and direct financing leases and interest expense of funding sources primarily interestbearing deposits and borrowings earning asset balances and related funding sources as well as changes in the levels of interest rates impact net interest income the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interestbearing liabilities is the net interest spread noninterestbearing sources of funds such as demand deposits and shareholders equity also support earning assets the impact of the noninterestbearing sources of funds often referred to as free funds is captured in the net interest margin which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets

10ksome of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit market liquidity operational and compliance risks are described in the following sectionscredit riskcredit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending we also have credit risk associated with our afs and htm securities portfolios see note 5 and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management mortgage banking and trading activities while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity based on our underwriting practices we believe this exposure is minimal see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statementswe continue to focus on the identification monitoring and managing of our credit risk in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes market risk management activities and portfolio diversification we use quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources enhanced use of modeling technology and internal stress testing processes our portfolio management resources demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile in our efforts to continue to identify risk mitigation techniques we have focused on product design features origination policies and solutions for delinquent or stressed borrowers 43table of contentsthe maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers all authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type geography industry and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives although we offer a broad set of products we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk portfolio profilethe checks and balances in the credit process and the separation of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and provide for effective problem asset management and resolution for example we do not extend additional credit

other projects the majority of these borrowers are customers doing business within our geographic regions campi loans and leases are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company andor the personal guarantee of the business owners the financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a campi loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral this treatment is a result of the credit decision process which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt the operation sale rental or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans as we have expanded our campi portfolio we have developed a series of vertical specialties to ensure that new products or lending types are embedded within a structured centralized commercial lending area with designated experienced credit officers these specialties are comprised of either targeted industries for example healthcare food amp agribusiness energy etc andor lending disciplines equipment finance abl etc all of which requires a high degree of expertise and oversight to effectively mitigate and monitor risk as such we have dedicated colleagues and teams focused on bringing value added expertise to these specialty clients cre  cre loans consist of loans to developers and reits supporting incomeproducing or forsale

the operation sale or refinance of the property for loans secured by real estate appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory

collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process we utilize a centralized preview and senior loan approval committee led by our chief credit officer the risk rating see next paragraph size and complexity of the credit determines the threshold for approval of the senior loan committee with a minimum credit exposure of 100 million for loans not requiring senior loan committee approval with the exception of small business loans credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority for small business loans we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures in this centralized decision environment certain individuals who understand each local region may make creditextension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities in which we operate in addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval processin commercial lending ongoing credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan we monitor all significant exposures on an ongoing basis all commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrowers pd and lgd this twodimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process the pd is rated and applied at the borrower level the lgd is rated and applied based on the specific type of credit extension and the quality and lien position associated with the underlying collateral the internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each periodic monitoring event there is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an ongoing basis we continually review and adjust our riskrating criteria based on actual experience which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate allowance for credit losses acl amount for the commercial portfolio a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio including small business loans to provide consistent oversightin addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and risk of new loan originations this group is part of our risk management area and conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans validate risk ratings and test the consistency of credit processesour standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment one of which is guarantor support on an annual basis or more frequently if warranted we consider among other things the guarantors reputation and creditworthiness along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth assuming such information is available our assessment of the guarantors credit strength or lack thereof is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans which is directly tied to and an integral component of our acl methodology when a loan goes to impaired status viable guarantor support is considered in the determination of a credit loss47table of contentsif our assessment of the guarantors credit strength yields an inherent capacity to

period with a 20year fully amortizing term at the end of the draw period prior to 2006 the standard product was a 10year draw period with a balloon payment in either case after the 10year draw period the borrower must reapply subject to full underwriting guidelines to continue with the interest only revolving structure or begin repaying the debt in a term structure the principal and interest payment associated with the term structure will be higher than the interestonly payment resulting in end of draw period risk our heloc risk can be segregated into two distinct segments 1 home equity linesofcredit underwritten with a balloon payment at maturity acquired from firstmerit and 2 home equity linesofcredit with an automatic conversion to a 20year amortizing loan we manage this risk based on both the actual maturity date of the lineofcredit structure and at the end of the 10year draw period this risk is embedded in the portfolio which we address with proactive contact strategies

tdr loanstdrs are modified loans where a concession was provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties tdrs can be classified as either accruing or nonaccruing loans nonaccruing tdrs are

acquired nonpurchased credit impaired loans are only considered for tdr reporting for modifications made subsequent to acquisition over the past five quarters the accruing component of the total tdr

terms however there are times when subsequent modifications are required such as when the modified loan matures often the loans are performing in accordance with the tdr terms and a new note is originated with similar modified terms these loans are subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing if the loan is not performing in accordance with the existing tdr terms typically an individualized approach to repayment is established in accordance with gaap the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan a new loan is considered for removal of the tdr designation a continuation of the prior note requires the continuation of the tdr designation and because the refinanced note constitutes a new or amended debt instrument it is included in our tdr activity table below as a new tdr and a restructured tdr removal during the periodthe types of concessions granted for existing tdrs are consistent with those granted on new tdrs and include interest rate reductions amortization or maturity date changes beyond what the collateral supports and principal forgiveness based on the borrowers specific needs at a point in time our policy does not limit the number of times a loan may be modified a loan may be modified multiple times if it is considered to be in the best interest of both the borrower and uscommercial loans are not automatically considered to be accruing tdrs upon the granting of a new concession if the loan is in accruing status and no loss is expected based on the modified terms the modified tdr remains in accruing status for loans that are on nonaccrual status before the modification collection of both principal and interest must not be in doubt and the borrower must be able to exhibit sufficient cash flows for at least a sixmonth period of time to service the debt in order to return to accruing status this sixmonth period could extend before or after the restructure dateany granted change in terms or conditions that are not readily available in the market for that borrower requires the designation as a tdr there are no provisions for the removal of the tdr designation based on payment activity for consumer loans a loan may be returned to accrual status when all contractually due interest and principal has been paid and the borrower demonstrates the financial capacity to continue to pay as agreed with the risk of loss diminished during the 2016 third quarter huntington transferred 81

declined to 110 at december 31 2016 compared to 133 at december 31 2015 the reduction in the ratio can be attributed directly to the acquisition of the firstmerit loan portfolio we believe the ratio is appropriate given the risk profile of our loan portfolio we continue to focus on early identification of loans with changes in credit metrics and proactive action plans for these loans given the combination of these noted positive and negative factors we believe that our acl is appropriate and its coverage level is reflective of the quality of our portfolio and the current operating

2amounts presented above exclude writedowns of loans transferred to loans heldforsalein assessing nco trends it is helpful to understand the process of how commercial loans are treated as they deteriorate over time the alll established is consistent with the level of risk associated with the original underwriting as a part of our normal portfolio management process for commercial loans the loan is periodically reviewed and the alll is increased or decreased based on the updated risk rating in certain cases the standard alll is determined to not be appropriate and a specific reserve is established based on the projected cash flow or collateral value of the specific loan chargeoffs if necessary are generally recognized in a period after the specific alll was established if the previously established alll exceeds that necessary to satisfactorily resolve the problem loan a reduction in the overall level of the alll could be recognized consumer loans are treated in much the same manner as commercial loans with increasing reserve factors applied based on the risk characteristics of the loan although specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans in summary if loan quality deteriorates the typical credit sequence would be periods of reserve building followed by periods of higher ncos as the previously established alll is utilized additionally an increase in the alll either precedes or is in conjunction with increases in nals when a loan is classified as nal it is evaluated for specific alll or chargeoff as a result an increase in nals does not necessarily result in an increase in the alll or an expectation of higher future ncosall residential mortgage loans greater than 150days past due are chargeddown to the estimated value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs the remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed or the loan goes through the foreclosure process 2016 versus 2015 ncos increased 21 million or 24 in 2016 given the low level of campi and cre ncos there will continue to be some volatility on a periodtoperiod comparison basis market riskmarket risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices including the correlation among these factors and their volatility when the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors the holder faces market risk we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiary foreign exchange positions equity investments and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans61table of contentsinterest rate riskoverviewwe actively manage interest rate risk as changes in market interest rates can have a significant impact on reported earnings changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of our financial instruments cash flows and net interest income we seek to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates alco oversees market risk management establishing risk measures limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital according to these policies responsibility for measuring and the management of interest rate risk resides in the corporate treasury group interest rate risk on our balance sheet consists of reprice option and basis risks reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing of asset and liability portfolios option risk arises from embedded options present in the investment portfolio and in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options deposit early withdrawal options and interest rate options these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for us basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices which subsequently result in a narrowing of profit spread on an earning asset or liability basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities such as interestbearing checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates the interest rate risk position is measured and monitored using risk management tools including earnings simulation modeling and eve sensitivity analysis which capture both shortterm and longterm interest rate risk exposures combining the results from these separate risk measurement processes allows a reasonably comprehensive view of our shortterm and longterm interest rate riskinterest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the alco monthly and roc at least quarterly the information reported includes periodend results and identifies any policy limits exceeded along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution mitigation or assumption of the riskwe use two approaches to model interest rate risk net interest income at risk nii at risk and evenii at risk uses net interest income simulation analysis which involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios including changes in the level of interest rates the shape of the yield curve and spreads between market interest rates the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is measured using numerous interest rate scenarios including shocks gradual ramps curve flattening curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rates scenarios modeling the sensitivity of net interest earnings to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process to the extent that actual performance is different than what was assumed actual net interest earnings sensitivity may be different than projected the assumptions used in the models are our best estimates based on studies conducted by the treasury department the treasury department uses a data warehouse to study interest rate risk at a transactional level and uses various adhoc reports to refine assumptions continuously assumptions and methodologies regarding administered rate liabilities eg savings money market and interestbearing checking accounts balance trends and repricing relationships reflect our best estimate of expected behavior and these assumptions are reviewed regularlywe also have longerterm interest rate risk exposure which may not be appropriately measured by earnings sensitivity analysis alco uses economic value of equity at risk modeling or eve sensitivity analysis to study the impact of longterm cash flows on earnings and capital eve involves discounting present values of all cash flows of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios the discounted present value of all cash flows represents our eve the analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario which will impact the discounted present value the amount of basecase measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow us to measure longerterm repricing and option risk in

for rising interest rates msrsthis section should be read in conjunction with note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statementsat december 31 2016 we had a total of 186 million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service 189 billion in mortgage loans of this 186 million 137 million was recorded using the fair value method and 1725 million was recorded using the amortization methodmsr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be reduced by prepayments prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise we have employed hedging strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment however volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges we report msr fair value adjustments net of hedgerelated trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking incomemsrs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with historically low interest rates resulting in a lower probability of prepayments and ultimately impairment msr assets are

instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting we have price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiary foreign exchange positions equity investments and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be

timely manner liquidity is managed to ensure stable reliable and costeffective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities we consider core earnings strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings which allows us costeffective access to marketbased liquidity we rely on a large stable core deposit base and a diversified base of wholesale funding sources to manage liquidity risk the alco is appointed by the roc to oversee liquidity risk management and the establishment of liquidity risk policies and limits the treasury department is responsible for identifying measuring and monitoring our liquidity profile the position is evaluated daily weekly and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future months and identifying sources and uses of funds the overall management of our liquidity position is also integrated into retail and commercial pricing policies to ensure a stable core deposit base liquidity risk is reviewed and managed continuously for the bank and the parent company as well as its subsidiaries in addition liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions provide policy guidance review funding strategies and oversee the adherence to and maintenance of the contingency funding plansour primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base core deposits comprised approximately 94 of total deposits at december 31 2016 we also have available unused wholesale sources of liquidity including advances from the fhlb of cincinnati issuance through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers liquidity is further provided by unencumbered or unpledged investment securities that totaled 150 billion as of december 31 2016 the treasury department also prepares a contingency funding plan that details the potential erosion of funds in the event of a systemic financial market crisis or institutionalspecific stress scenario an example of an institution specific event would be a downgrade in our public credit rating by a rating agency due to factors such as deterioration in asset quality a large charge to earnings a decline in profitability or other financial measures or a significant merger or acquisition examples of systemic events unrelated to us that could have an effect on our access to liquidity would be terrorism or war natural disasters political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources the liquidity contingency plan therefore outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles

include commitments to extend credit interest rate swaps financial guarantees contained in standby lettersofcredit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loanscommitments to extend creditcommitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates are variablerate and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly shortterm variablerate nature see note 21 for

these fee sharing allocationsexpense allocationthe management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all five business segments from treasury  other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury  other expenses except reported significant items and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the five business segmentsfunds transfer pricing ftpwe use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury  other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury  other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market

results of operations or financial position where nongaap financial measures are used the comparable gaap financial measure as well as the reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure can be found herein significant itemsfrom timetotime revenue expenses or taxes are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities andor by items that while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or shortterm in nature we refer to such items as significant items most often these significant items result from factors originating outside the company eg regulatory actions  assessments windfall gains changes in accounting principles onetime tax assessments  refunds litigation actions etc in other cases they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business eg merger  restructuring charges recapitalization actions goodwill impairment etceven though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions as a general rule volatility alone does not define a significant item for example changes in the provision for credit losses gains  losses from investment activities asset valuation writedowns etc reflect ordinary banking activities and are therefore typically excluded from consideration as a significant itemwe believe the disclosure of significant items provides a better understanding of our performance and trends to ascertain which of such items if any to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance ie within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations as well as how if at all to adjust estimates of future performance accordingly to this end we adopted a practice of listing significant items in our external disclosure documents eg earnings press releases investor presentations forms 10q and 10ksignificant items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performancefullytaxable equivalent basisinterest income yields and ratios on a fte basis are considered nongaap financial measures management believes net interest income on a fte basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes the fte basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and taxexempt sources the fte basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent we encourage readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10k in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measurenonregulatory capital ratiosin addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy includingtangible common equity to tangible assets andtangible common equity to riskweighted assets using basel iii definitions93table of contentsthese nonregulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the companys capitalization to other financial services companies these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies these ratios are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap or federal banking regulations as a result these nonregulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company are considered nongaap financial measuresbecause there are no standardized definitions for these nonregulatory capital ratios the companys calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies also there may be limits

statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference into this mdampa describes the significant accounting policies we use in our consolidated financial statementsan accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed belowallowance for credit lossesour acl of 07 billion at december 31 2016 represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risk associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsvaluation of financial instrumentsassets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility assets measured at fair value include certain loans held for sale loans held for investment availableforsale and trading securities certain securitized automobile loans msrs derivatives and certain shortterm borrowings at december 31 2016 approximately 158 billion of our assets and 01 billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in addition to the above mentioned ongoing fair value measurements fair value is also used for recording business combinations and measuring other nonrecurring financial assets and liabilities at the end of each quarter we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured at fair value as necessary assets or liabilities may be transferred within fair value hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement datewhere available we use quoted market prices to determine fair value if quoted market prices are not available fair value is determined using either internally developed or independent thirdparty valuation models based on inputs that are either directly observable or derived from market data these inputs include but are not limited to interest rate yield curves option volatilities or option adjusted spreads where neither quoted market prices nor observable market data are available fair value is determined using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on managements expectation that market participants 94table of contentswould use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability the determination of appropriate unobservable inputs requires exercise of significant judgment a significant portion of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value are measured based on quoted market prices or observable market independent inputsthe following is a description of the significant estimates used in the valuation of financial assets and liabilities for which quoted market prices and observable market parameters are not availablemunicipal and assetbacked securitiesthe municipal securities portion that is classified as level 3 uses significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the fair value is determined by utilizing thirdparty valuation services the thirdparty service provider reviews credit worthiness prevailing market rates analysis of similar securities and projected cash flows the thirdparty service provider also incorporates industry and general economic conditions into their analysis huntington evaluates the analysis provided for reasonablenessour cdo preferred securities portfolios are measured at fair value using a valuation methodology involving use of significant unobservable inputs and are thus classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy the private label cmo securities portfolio is subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows while the cash flows of our cdo preferred securities portfolio is reviewed quarterly these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties and are used as a basis for impairment analysiscdo preferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio we engage a thirdparty pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooledtrustpreferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio the pd of each issuer and the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value management evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the thirdparty pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter actual defaults and deferrals in the current period and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with asc 820derivatives used for hedging purposesderivatives designated as qualified hedges are tested for hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis assessments are made at the inception of the hedge and on a recurring basis to determine whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item a statistical regression analysis is performed to measure the effectivenessif based on the assessment a derivative is not expected to be a highly effective hedge or it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge hedge accounting is discontinued as of the quarter the hedge is not highly effective as the statistical regression analysis requires the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are sensitive to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates we consider this a critical accounting estimateloans held for salehuntington has elected to apply the fair value option to certain residential mortgage loans that are classified as held for sale at origination the fair value of such loans is estimated based on the inputs that include prices of mortgage backed securities adjusted for other variables such as interest rates expected credit defaults and market discount rates the adjusted value reflects the price we expect to receive from the sale of such loanscertain consumer and commercial loans are classified as held for sale and are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value the determination of fair value for these consumer loans is based on observable prices for similar products or discounted expected cash flows which takes into consideration factors such as future interest rates prepayment speeds default and loss curves and market discount rates mortgage servicing rightsretained rights to service mortgage loans are recognized as a separate and distinct asset at the time the loans are sold mortgage servicing rights msrs are initially recorded at fair value at the time the related loans are sold and subsequently remeasured at each reporting date under either the fair value or amortization method the election of the fair value or amortization method is made at the time each servicing asset is established all newly created msrs since 2009 are recorded using the amortization method any increase or decrease in fair value of msrs accounted for under the fair value method as well as any amortization andor impairment of msrs recorded under the amortization method is reflected in earnings in the period that the changes occur msrs are subject to 95table of contentsinterest rate risk in that their fair value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment fair value is determined based upon the application of an income approach valuation model we use an independent thirdparty valuation model which incorporates assumptions in estimating future cash flows these assumptions include prepayment speeds payoffs and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions the reasonableness of these pricing models is validated on a minimum of a quarterly basis by at least one independent external service broker valuation because the fair values of msrs are significantly impacted by the use of estimates the use of different assumptions can result in different estimated fair values of those msrscontingent liabilitieswe are a party to various claims litigation and legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current andor former operations we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a casebycase basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering among other factors the progress of each case or proceeding our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings and the opinions and views of legal counsel litigation exposure represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our controlincome taxesthe calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments we have two accruals for income taxes 1 our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal state and local taxing jurisdictions net of any reserve for potential audit issues and any tax refunds and the net receivable balance is reported as a component of accrued income and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 2 our deferred federal and state income tax and related valuation accounts reported as a component of accrued income and other assets represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under gaap and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under federal and state tax lawin the ordinary course of business we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes the effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws we believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements we review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions in addition we rely on various tax opinions recent tax audits and historical experiencefrom timetotime we engage in business transactions that may affect our tax liabilities where appropriate we obtain opinions of outside experts and assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking into account statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position however changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates implementation of new business strategies resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance such changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position andor results of operations see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statementsdeferred tax assetsat december 31 2016 we had a net federal deferred tax asset of 76 million and a net state deferred tax asset of 41 million a valuation allowance is provided when it is morelikelythannot some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized all available evidence both positive and negative was considered to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence impairment should be recognized our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change if our forecast of taxable income within the carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets such assets may be impaired based on our analysis of both positive and negative evidence and our ability to offset the net deferred tax assets against our forecasted future taxable income there was no impairment of the net deferred tax assets at december 31 2016 other than a valuation allowance relating to state net operating loss carryoversgoodwill and intangible assetsthe acquisition method of accounting requires that acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair values as of the date of acquisition this often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques all of which are inherently subjective acquisitions typically result in goodwill the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value which is subject to impairment testing at least annually the amortization of identified intangible assets recognized in a business combination is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received over their economic life which is also subjective customer attrition rates that are based on historical 96table of

to maturity and the source of both interest and principal payments to identify securities which could potentially be impaired for those debt securities that huntington intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell before the recovery of their amortized cost bases the difference between fair value and amortized cost is considered to be otti and is recognized in noninterest income for those debt securities that huntington does not intend to sell or is not more likely than not required to sell prior to expected recovery of amortized cost bases the credit portion of the otti is recognized in noninterest income while the noncredit portion is recognized on oci in determining the credit portion huntington uses a discounted cash flow analysis which includes evaluating the timing and amount of the expected cash flows noncreditrelated otti results from other factors including increased liquidity spreads and higher interest rates presentation of otti is made in the consolidated

such as federal home loan bank stock and federal reserve bank stock these securities are accounted for at cost evaluated for impairment and included in availableforsale and other securities loans and leases  loans and direct financing leases for which huntington has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as loans and leases except for loans for which the fair value option has been elected loans and leases are carried at the principal amount outstanding net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs and net of unearned income direct financing leases are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values net of unearned and deferred income interest income is accrued as earned using the interest method based on unpaid principal balances huntington defers the fees it receives from the origination of loans and leases as well as the direct costs of those activities huntington also acquires loans at a premium and at a discount to their contractual values huntington amortizes loan discounts premiums and net loan origination fees and costs on a levelyield basis over the contractual lives of the related loans which would not include purchased credit impaired loanstroubled debt restructurings are loans for which the original contractual terms have been modified to provide a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties loan modifications are considered tdrs when the concessions provided are not available to the borrower through either normal channels or other sources however not all loan modifications are tdrs modifications resulting in troubled debt restructurings may include changes to one or more terms of the loan including but not limited to a change in interest rate an extension of the repayment period a reduction in payment amount and partial forgiveness or deferment of principal or accrued interestresidual values on leased equipment are evaluated quarterly for impairment impairment of the residual values of direct financing leases determined to be other than temporary is recognized by writing the leases down to fair value with a charge to other noninterest expense leased equipment residual value impairment will arise if the expected fair value is less than the carrying amount net of estimated amounts reimbursable by the lessee future declines in the expected residual value of the leased equipment would result in expected losses of the leased equipment for leased equipment the residual component of a direct financing lease represents the estimated fair value of the leased equipment at the end of the lease term huntington uses industry data historical experience and independent appraisals to establish these residual value estimates additional information regarding product life cycle product upgrades as well as insight into competing products are obtained through relationships with industry contacts and are factored into residual value estimates where applicableloans held for sale  loans in which huntington does not have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as loans held for sale loans held for sale excluding loans originated or acquired with the intent to sell which are carried at fair value are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell the fair value option is generally elected for mortgage loans held for sale to facilitate hedging of the loans the fair value of such loans is estimated based on the inputs that include prices of mortgage backed securities adjusted for other variables such as interest rates expected credit defaults and market discount rates the adjusted value reflects the price we expect to receive from the sale of such loansallowance for credit losses  huntington maintains two reserves both of which reflect managements judgment regarding the appropriate level necessary to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the alll and the aulc combined these reserves comprise the total acl the determination of the acl requires significant estimates including the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and leases consideration of current economic conditions and historical loss experience pertaining to pools of homogeneous loans and leases all of which may be susceptible to change110table of contentsthe appropriateness of the acl is based on managements current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio these judgments consider ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support further management evaluates the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above additional factors also considered include the impact of increasing or decreasing commercial real estate values and the development of new or expanded commercial business segments also the acl assessment includes the ongoing assessment of credit quality metrics and a comparison of certain acl benchmarks to current performance the alll consists of two components 1 the transaction reserve which includes a loan level allocation specific reserves related to loans considered to be impaired and loans involved in troubled debt restructurings and 2 the general reserve the transaction reserve component includes both 1 an estimate of loss based on pools of commercial and consumer loans and leases with similar characteristics and 2 an estimate of loss based on an impairment review of each impaired campi and cre loan where obligor balance is greater than 10 million for the campi and cre portfolios the estimate of loss based on pools of loans and leases with similar characteristics is made by applying a pd factor and a lgd factor to each individual loan based on a regularly updated loan grade using a standardized loan grading system the pd factor and an lgd factor are determined for each loan grade using statistical models based on historical performance data the pd factor considers ongoing reviews of the financial performance of the specific borrower including cash flow debtservice coverage ratio earnings power debt level and equity position in conjunction with an assessment of the borrowers industry and future prospects the lgd factor considers analysis of the type of collateral and the relative ltv ratio these reserve factors are developed based on credit migration models that track historical movements of loans between loan ratings over time and a combination of longterm average loss experience of our own portfolio and external industry datain the case of more homogeneous portfolios such as automobile loans home equity loans and residential mortgage loans the determination of the transaction reserve also incorporates pd and lgd factors the estimate of loss is based on pools of loans and leases with similar characteristics the pd factor considers current credit scores unless the account is delinquent in which case a higher pd factor is used the credit score provides a basis for understanding the borrowers past and current payment performance and this information is used to estimate expected losses over the emergence period the performance of firstlien loans ahead of our juniorlien loans is available to use as part of our updated score process the lgd factor considers analysis of the type of collateral and the relative ltv ratio credit scores models analyses and other factors used to determine both the pd and lgd factors are updated frequently to capture the recent behavioral characteristics of the subject portfolios as well as any changes in loss mitigation or credit origination strategies and adjustments to the reserve factors are made as required the general reserve consists of various riskprofile reserve components the riskprofile component considers items unique to our structure policies processes and portfolio composition as well as qualitative measurements and assessments of the loan portfolios including but not limited to management quality concentrations portfolio composition industry comparisons and internal review functionsthe estimate for the aulc is determined using the same procedures and methodologies as used for the alll the loss factors used in the aulc are the same as the loss factors used in the alll while also considering a historical utilization of unused commitments the aulc is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheetsnonaccrual and past due loans  loans are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due dateany loan in any portfolio may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to the policies described below when collection of principal or interest is in doubt when a borrower with debt is discharged in a chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower the loan is determined to be collateral dependent and placed on nonaccrual status unless there is a coborrowerall classes within the campi and cre portfolios except for purchased creditimpaired loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 90days past due firstlien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 150days past due juniorlien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of 120days past due or when the related firstlien loan has been identified as nonaccrual automobile and other consumer loans are generally chargedoff when the loan is 120days past due residential mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 150days past due with the exception of residential mortgages guaranteed by government agencies which continue to accrue interest at the rate guaranteed by the government agency we are reimbursed from the government agency for reasonable expenses incurred in servicing loans for all classes within all loan portfolios when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status any accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to interest income and prior year amounts chargedoff as a credit loss111table of contentsfor all classes within all loan portfolios cash receipts on nals are applied against principal until the loan or lease has been collected in full including chargedoff portion after which time any additional cash receipts are recognized as interest income however for secured nonreaffirmed debt in a chapter 7 bankruptcy payments are applied to principal and interest when the borrower has demonstrated a capacity to continue payment of the debt and collection of the debt is reasonably assured for unsecured nonreaffirmed debt in a chapter 7 bankruptcy where the carrying value has been fully chargedoff payments are recorded as loan recoveriesregarding all classes within the campi and cre portfolios the determination of a borrowers ability to make the required principal and interest payments is based on an examination of the borrowers current financial statements industry management capabilities and other qualitative measures for all classes within the consumer loan portfolio the determination of a borrowers ability to make the required principal and interest payments is based on multiple factors including number of days past due and in some instances an evaluation of the borrowers financial condition when in managements judgment the borrowers ability to make required principal and interest payments resumes and collectability is no longer in doubt supported by sustained repayment history the loan is returned to accrual status for these loans that have been returned to accrual status cash receipts are applied according to the contractual terms of the loanchargeoff of uncollectible loans  any loan in any portfolio may be chargedoff prior to the policies described below if a loss confirming event has occurred loss confirming events include but are not limited to bankruptcy unsecured continued delinquency foreclosure or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency and that asset is the sole source of repayment additionally discharged collateral dependent nonreaffirmed debt in chapter 7 bankruptcy filings will result in a chargeoff to estimated collateral value less anticipated selling costscampi and cre loans are either chargedoff or written down to net realizable value at 90days past due automobile loans and other consumer loans are chargedoff at 120days past due firstlien and juniorlien home equity loans are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs at 150days past due and 120days past due respectively residential mortgages are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the collateral at 150days past dueimpaired loans  for all classes within the campi and cre portfolios all loans with an obligor balance of 10 million or greater are evaluated on a quarterly basis for impairment except for tdrs consumer loans within any class are generally not individually evaluated on a regular basis for impairment all tdrs regardless of the outstanding balance amount are also considered to be impaired loans acquired with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable at acquisition that all contractually required payments will not be collected are also considered to be impairedonce a loan has been identified for an assessment of impairment the loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected this determination requires significant judgment and use of estimates and the eventual outcome may differ significantly from those estimateswhen a loan in any class has been determined to be impaired the amount of the impairment is measured using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or as a practical expedient the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent when the present value of expected future cash flows is used the effective interest rate is the original contractual interest rate of the loan adjusted for any cost fee premium or discount when the contractual interest rate is variable the effective interest rate of the loan changes over time a specific reserve is established as a component of the alll when a loan has been determined to be impaired subsequent to the initial measurement of impairment if there is a significant change to the impaired loans expected future cash flows or if actual cash flows are significantly different from the cash flows previously estimated huntington recalculates the impairment and appropriately adjusts the specific reserve similarly if huntington measures impairment based on the observable market price of an impaired loan or the fair value of the collateral of an impaired collateral dependent loan huntington will adjust the specific reservewhen a loan within any class is impaired the accrual of interest income is discontinued unless the receipt of principal and interest is no longer in doubt interest income on tdrs is accrued when all principal and interest is expected to be collected under the postmodification terms cash receipts on nonaccruing impaired loans within any class are generally applied entirely against principal until the loan has been collected in full including already chargedoff portion after which time any additional cash receipts are recognized as interest income cash receipts on accruing impaired loans within any class are applied in the same manner as accruing loans that are not considered impairedpurchased creditimpaired loans  purchased loans with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable at acquisition that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are considered to be credit impaired purchased creditimpaired loans are initially recorded at fair value which is estimated by discounting the cash flows expected to be collected at the acquisition date because the estimate of expected cash flows reflects an estimate of future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loans an allowance for credit losses is not recorded at the acquisition date the excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value referred to as the accretable yield is recognized in interest income 112table of contentsover the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans on a levelyield basis the difference between the contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference a subsequent decrease in the estimate of cash flows expected to be received on purchased creditimpaired loans generally results in the recognition of an allowance for credit losses subsequent increases in cash flows result in reversal of any nonaccretable difference or allowance for loan and lease losses to the extent any has been recorded with a positive impact on interest income subsequently recognized the measurement of cash flows involves assumptions and judgments for interest rates prepayments default rates loss severity and collateral values all of these factors are inherently subjective and significant changes in the cash flow estimates over the life of the loan can resulttransfers of financial assets and securitizations  transfers of financial assets in which we have surrendered control over the transferred assets are accounted for as sales in assessing whether control has been surrendered we consider whether the transferee would be a consolidated affiliate the existence and extent of any continuing involvement in the transferred financial assets and the impact of all arrangements or agreements made contemporaneously with or in contemplation of the transfer even if they were not entered into at the time of transfer control is generally considered to have been surrendered when i the transferred assets have been legally isolated from us or any of our consolidated affiliates even in bankruptcy or other receivership ii the transferee or if the transferee is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization or assetbacked financing that is constrained from pledging or exchanging the assets it receives each thirdparty holder of its beneficial interests has the right to pledge or exchange the assets or beneficial interests it received without any constraints that provide more than a trivial benefit to us and iii neither we nor our consolidated affiliates and agents have a both the right and obligation under any agreement to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets before their maturity b the unilateral ability to cause the holder to return specific financial assets that also provides us with a morethantrivial benefit other than through a cleanup call or c an agreement that permits the transferee to require us to repurchase the transferred assets at a price so favorable that it is probable that it will require us to repurchase themif the sale criteria are met the transferred financial assets are removed from our balance sheet and a gain or loss on sale is recognized if the sale criteria are not met the transfer is recorded as a secured borrowing in which the assets remain on our balance sheet and the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a liability for the majority of financial asset transfers it is clear whether or not we have surrendered control for other transfers such as in connection with complex transactions or where we have continuing involvement we generally obtain a legal opinion as to whether the transfer results in a true sale by lawfrom time to time we securitize certain automobile receivables gains and losses on the loans and leases sold and servicing rights associated with loan and lease sales are determined when the related loans or leases are sold to either a securitization trust or thirdparty for loan or lease sales with servicing retained a servicing asset is recorded at fair value for the right to service the loans soldderivative financial instruments  a variety of derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps caps floors and collars are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements these instruments provide flexibility in adjusting huntingtons sensitivity to changes in interest rates without exposure to loss of principal and higher funding requirementshuntington also uses derivatives principally loan sale commitments in hedging its mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and its mortgage loans held for sale mortgage loan sale commitments and the related interest rate lock commitments are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking income huntington also uses certain derivative financial instruments to offset changes in value of its msrs these derivatives consist primarily of forward interest rate agreements and forward mortgage contracts the derivative instruments used are not designated as qualifying hedges accordingly such derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking incomederivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities respectively and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into we designate it as either a qualifying hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedgea qualifying hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset liability or forecasted transaction cash flow

contentsthe hedged item affects earnings ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship is reflected in current period earnings changes in the fair value of derivatives held for trading purposes or which do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in current period earningsfor those derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied huntington formally documents the hedging relationship and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge this documentation identifies the hedging instrument the hedged item or transaction the nature of the risk being hedged and unless the hedge meets all of the criteria to assume there is no ineffectiveness the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging instrument and how ineffectiveness will be measured the methods utilized to assess retrospective hedge effectiveness as well as the frequency of testing vary based on the type of item being hedged and the designated hedge period for specifically designated fair value hedges of certain fixedrate debt huntington utilizes the shortcut method when certain criteria are met for other fair value hedges of fixedrate debt including certificates of deposit huntington utilizes the regression method to evaluate hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis for fair value hedges of portfolio loans the regression method is used to evaluate effectiveness on a daily basis for cash flow hedges the regression method is applied on a quarterly basishedge accounting is discontinued prospectively whenthe derivative is no longer effective or expected to be effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item including firm commitments or forecasted transactionsthe derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercisedit is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occurthe hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment orthe designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is removedwhen hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value or cash flow hedge the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair valuein the case of a discontinued fair value hedge of a recognized asset or liability as long as the hedged item continues to exist on the balance sheet the hedged item will no longer be adjusted for changes in fair value the basis adjustment that had previously been recorded to the hedged item during the period from the hedge designation date to the hedge discontinuation date is recognized as an adjustment to the yield of the hedged item over the remaining life of the hedged itemin the case of a discontinued cash flow hedge of a recognized asset or liability as long as the hedged item continues to exist on the balance sheet the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the hedging derivative will no longer be recorded to other comprehensive income the balance applicable to the discontinued hedging relationship will be recognized in earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item as an adjustment to yield if the discontinued hedged item was a forecasted transaction that is not expected to occur any amounts recorded on the balance sheet related to the hedged item including any amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified to current period earningsin the case of either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge if the previously hedged item is sold or extinguished the basis adjustment to the underlying asset or liability or any remaining unamortized other comprehensive income balance will be reclassified to current period earningsin all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued the derivative will be carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings unless redesignated as a qualifying hedgelike other financial instruments derivatives contain an element of credit risk which is the possibility that huntington will incur a loss because the counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations notional values of interest rate swaps and other offbalance sheet financial instruments significantly exceed the credit risk associated with these instruments and represent contractual balances on which calculations of amounts to be exchanged are based credit exposure is limited to the sum of the aggregate fair value of positions that have become favorable to huntington including any accrued interest receivable due from counterparties potential credit losses are mitigated through careful evaluation of counterparty credit standing selection of counterparties from a limited group of high quality institutions collateral agreements and other contract provisions huntington considers the value of collateral held and collateral provided in determining the net carrying value of derivativeshuntington offsets the fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and the fair value for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangementrepossessed collateral  repossessed collateral also referred to as oreo is comprised principally of commercial and residential real estate properties obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations and is carried at fair value collateral obtained in satisfaction of a loan is recorded at the estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs based upon the propertys 114table of contentsappraised value at the date of foreclosure with any difference between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of the loan recorded as a chargeoff if the fair value is higher than the carrying amount of the loan the excess is recognized first as a recovery and then as noninterest income subsequent declines in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are recorded in noninterest expense gains or losses resulting from the sale of collateral are recognized in noninterest expense at the date of salecollateral  we pledge assets as collateral as required for various transactions including security repurchase agreements public deposits loan notes derivative financial instruments shortterm borrowings and longterm borrowings assets that have been pledged as collateral including those that can be sold or repledged by the secured party continue to be reported on our consolidated balance sheetswe also accept collateral primarily as part of various transactions including derivative and security resale agreements collateral accepted by us including collateral that we can sell or repledge is excluded from our consolidated balance sheetsthe market value of collateral we have accepted or pledged is regularly monitored and additional collateral is obtained or provided as necessary to ensure appropriate collateral coverage in these transactions premises and equipment  premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is computed principally by the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets buildings and building improvements are depreciated over an average of 30 to 40 years and 10 to 30 years respectively land improvements and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over an average of 5 to 20 years while equipment is depreciated over a range of 3 to 10 years leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the assets useful life or the lease term including any renewal periods for which renewal is reasonably assured maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred while improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life premises and equipment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverablemortgage servicing rights  huntington recognizes the rights to service mortgage loans as separate assets which are included in servicing rights in the consolidated balance sheets when purchased or when servicing is contractually separated from the underlying mortgage loans by sale or securitization of the loans with servicing rights retainedfor loan sales with servicing retained a servicing asset is recorded on the day of the sale at fair value for the right to service the loans sold to determine the fair value of a msr huntington uses an option adjusted spread cash flow analysis incorporating market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and market interest rates the forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for us dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments the current and projected mortgage interest rate influences the prepayment rate and therefore the timing and magnitude of the cash flows associated with the msr servicing revenues on mortgage loans are included in mortgage banking incomeat the time of initial capitalization msrs may be grouped into servicing classes based on the availability of market inputs used in determining fair value and the method used for managing the risks of the servicing assets msr assets are recorded using the fair value method or the amortization method the election of the fair value or amortization method is made at the time each servicing class is established all newly created msrs since 2009 were recorded using the amortization method any change in the fair value of msrs carried under the fair value method as well as amortization and impairment of msrs under the amortization method during the period is recorded in mortgage banking income which is reflected in the consolidated statements of income huntington economically hedges the value of certain msrs using derivative instruments and trading securities changes in fair value of these derivatives and trading securities are reported as a component of mortgage banking incomegoodwill and other intangible assets  under the acquisition method of accounting the net assets of entities acquired byhuntington are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition the excess cost of the acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized either on an accelerated or straightline basis over their estimated useful lives goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis at october 1st of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable indefinitelived

various actuarial assumptions regarding expected future experiencecertain employees are participants in various defined contribution and other nonqualified supplemental retirement plans our contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to current earnings in addition we maintain a 401k plan covering substantially all employees employer contributions to the plan which are

employees under various stock option and restricted share plans stock compensation costs are recognized prospectively for all new awards granted under these plans compensation expense relating to share options is calculated using a methodology that is based on the underlying assumptions of the blackscholes option pricing model and is charged to expense over the requisite service period eg vesting period compensation expense relating to restricted stock awards is based upon the fair value of the awards on the date of grant and is charged to earnings over the requisite service period eg vesting period of the awardstock repurchases  acquisitions of huntington stock are recorded at cost the reissuance of shares is recorded at weightedaverage costincome taxes  income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method accordingly deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future book and tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income at the time of enactment of such change in tax rates any interest or penalties due for payment of income taxes are included in the provision for income taxes to the extent that we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is recorded all positive and negative evidence is reviewed when determining how much of a valuation allowance is recognized on a quarterly basis in determining the requirements for a valuation allowance sources of possible taxable income are evaluated including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future

protection for the separate accounts is provided by the insurance carriers and a highly rated major bankfair value measurements  the company records or discloses certain of its assets and liabilities at fair value fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date fair value measurements are classified within one of three levels in a valuation hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date the three levels are defined as followslevel 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active marketslevel 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrumentlevel 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurementa financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurementsegment results  accounting policies for the business segments are the same as those used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements with respect to activities specifically attributable to each business segment however the preparation of business segment results requires management to establish methodologies to allocate funding costs and benefits expenses and other financial elements to each business segment which is described in note 24 116table of contents2 accounting standards updateasu 201409revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 the amendments in asu 201409 supersede the revenue recognition requirements in topic 605 revenue recognition and most industryspecific guidance the general principle of the amendments require an entity to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the guidance sets forth a five step approach for revenue recognition the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period management intends to adopt the new guidance on january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective approach and is well into its outlined implementation plan in this regard management has completed a preliminary analysis that includes a identification of all revenue streams included in the financial statements b determination of scope exclusions to identify inscope revenue streams c determination of size timing and amount of revenue recognition for inscope items d determination of sample size of contracts for further analysis and e completion of limited analysis on selected contracts to evaluate the potential impact of the new guidance the key revenue streams identified include service charges credit card and payment processing fees trust services fees insurance income brokerage services and mortgage banking income the new guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on huntingtons consolidated financial statements asu 201601  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities the amendments in this update make targeted improvements to gaap including but not limited to requiring an entity to measure its equity investments with changes in the fair value recognized in the income statement requiring an entity to present separately in oci the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrumentspecific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments ie fvo liability requiring public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes assessing deferred tax assets related to a net unrealized loss on afs securities in combination with the entitys other deferred tax assets and eliminating some of the disclosures required by the existing gaap while requiring entities to present and disclose some additional information the new guidance is effective for the fiscal period beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods within those fiscal years an entity should apply the amendments as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption the amendment is not expected to have a material impact on huntingtons consolidated financial statementsasu 201602  leases this update sets forth a new lease accounting model for lessors and lessees for lessees virtually all leases will be required to be recognized on the balance sheet by recording a rightofuse asset and lease liability subsequent accounting for leases varies depending on whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease the accounting applied by a lessor is

quality indicatorsto facilitate the monitoring of credit quality for campi and cre loans and for purposes of determining an appropriate acl level for these loans huntington utilizes the following internally defined categories of credit gradespass  higher quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories described belowolem  the credit risk may be relatively minor yet represent a risk given certain specific circumstances if the potential weaknesses are not monitored or mitigated the loan may weaken or the collateral may be inadequate to protect huntingtons position in the future for these reasons huntington considers the loans to be potential problem loanssubstandard  inadequately protected loans by the borrowers ability to repay equity andor the collateral pledged to secure the loan these loans have identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt it is likely huntington will sustain some loss if any identified weaknesses are not mitigateddoubtful  loans that have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as substandard with the added elements of the full collection of the loan is improbable and that the possibility of loss is highthe categories above which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions are assigned upon initial approval of the loan or lease and subsequently updated as appropriatecommercial loans categorized as olem substandard or doubtful are considered criticized loans commercial loans categorized as substandard or doubtful are both considered classified loansfor all classes within consumer loan portfolios each loan is assigned a specific pd factor that is partially based on the borrowers most recent credit bureau score which we update quarterly a credit bureau score is a credit score developed by fair isaaccorporation based on data provided by the credit bureaus the credit bureau score is widely accepted as the standard measure of consumer credit risk used by lenders regulators rating agencies and consumers the higher the credit bureau score the higher likelihood of repayment and therefore an indicator of higher credit qualityhuntington assesses the risk in the loan portfolio by utilizing numerous risk characteristics the classifications described above and also presented in the table below represent one of those characteristics that

type however the aggregate amount of principal forgiven as a result of loans modified as tdrs during the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 was not significantfollowing is a description of tdrs by the different loan typescommercial loan tdrs  commercial accruing tdrs often result from loans receiving a concession with terms that are not considered a market transaction to huntington the tdr remains in accruing status as long as the customer is less than 90days past due on payments per the restructured loan terms and no loss is expectedcommercial nonaccrual tdrs result from either 1 an accruing commercial tdr being placed on nonaccrual status or 2 a workout where an existing commercial nal is restructured and a concession is given at times these workouts restructure the nal so that two or more new notes are created the primary note is underwritten based upon our normal underwriting standards and is sized so projected cash flows are sufficient to repay contractual principal and interest the terms on the secondary notes vary by situation and may include notes that defer principal and interest payments until after the primary note is repaid creating two or more notes often allows the borrower to continue a project and allows huntington to rightsize a loan based upon the current expectations for a borrowers or projects performanceour strategy involving tdr borrowers includes working with these borrowers to allow them to refinance elsewhere as well as allow them time to improve their financial position and remain a huntington customer through refinancing their notes according to market terms and conditions in the future a subsequent refinancing or modification of a loan may occur when either the loan matures according to the terms of the tdrmodified agreement or the borrower requests a change to the loan agreements at that time the loan is evaluated to determine if the borrower is creditworthy it is subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan a new loan is considered for removal of the tdr designation whereas a continuation of the prior note requires a continuation of the tdr designation in order for a tdr designation to be removed the borrower must no longer be experiencing financial difficulties and the terms of the refinanced loan must not represent a concessionconsumer loan tdrs  residential mortgage tdrs represent loan modifications associated with traditional firstlien mortgage loans in which a concession has been provided to the borrower the primary concessions given to residential mortgage borrowers are amortization or maturity date changes and interest rate reductions residential mortgages identified as tdrs involve borrowers unable to refinance their mortgages through the companys normal mortgage origination channels or through other independent sources some but not all of the loans may be delinquent the company may make similar interest rate term and principal concessions for automobile home equity rv and marine finance and other consumer loan tdrstdr impact on credit qualityhuntingtons alll is largely determined by updated risk ratings assigned to commercial loans updated borrower credit scores on consumer loans and borrower delinquency history in both the commercial and consumer portfolios these updated risk ratings and credit scores consider the default history of the borrower including payment redefaults as such the provision for credit losses is impacted primarily by changes in borrower payment performance rather than the tdr classification tdrs can be classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans nonaccrual tdrs are included in nals whereas accruing tdrs are excluded from nals as it is probable that all contractual principal and interest due under the restructured terms will be collected132table of contentsthe companys tdrs may include multiple concessions and the disclosure classifications are presented based on the primary concession provided to the borrower the majority of the concessions for the campi and cre portfolios are the extension of the maturity date but could also include an increase in the interest rate in these instances the primary concession is the maturity date extensiontdr concessions may also result in the reduction of the alll within the campi and cre portfolios this reduction is derived from payments and the resulting application of the reserve calculation within the alll the transaction reserve for nontdr campi and cre loans is calculated based upon several estimated probability factors such as pd and lgd upon the occurrence of a tdr in our campi and cre portfolios the reserve is measured based on discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs of the modified loan in accordance with asc 31010 the resulting tdr alll calculation often results in a lower alll amount because 1 the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs indicate a lower estimated loss 2 if the modification includes a rate increase the discounting of the cash flows on the modified loan using the premodification interest rate exceeds the carrying value of the loan or 3 payments may occur as part of the modification the alll for campi and cre loans may increase as a result of the modification as the discounted cash flow analysis may indicate additional reserves are requiredtdr concessions on consumer loans may increase the alll the concessions made to these borrowers often include interest rate reductions and therefore the tdr alll calculation results in a greater alll compared with the nontdr calculation as the reserve is measured based on the estimation of the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs on the modified loan in accordance with asc 31010 the resulting tdr alll calculation often results in a higher alll amount because 1 the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs indicate a higher estimated loss or 2 due to the rate decrease the discounting of the cash flows on the modified loan using the premodification interest rate indicates a reduction in the present value of expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs however in certain instances the alll may decrease as a result of payments made in connection with the modificationcommercial loan tdrs  in instances where the bank substantiates that it will collect its outstanding balance in full the note is considered for return to accrual status upon the borrower showing a sustained period of repayment performance for a sixmonth period of time this sixmonth period could extend before or after the restructure date if a chargeoff was taken as part of the restructuring any interest or principal payments received on that note are applied to first reduce the banks outstanding book balance and then to recoveries of chargedoff principal unpaid interest andor fee expenses while the tdr is in nonaccrual statusconsumer loan tdrs  modified consumer loans identified as tdrs are aggregated into pools for analysis cash flows and weighted average interest rates are used to calculate impairment at the pooledloan level once the loans are aggregated into the pool they continue to be classified as tdrs until contractually repaid or chargedoffresidential mortgage loans not guaranteed by a us government agency such as the fha va and the usda including tdr loans are reported as accrual or nonaccrual based upon delinquency status nonaccrual tdrs are those that are greater than 150days contractually past due loans guaranteed by us government organizations continue to accrue interest on guaranteed rates upon delinquencythe following table presents by class and by the reason

is completed by evaluating the relevant credit and structural aspects of each pooledtrustpreferred security in the portfolio including collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in the security and terms of the securitys structure the credit review includes an analysis of profitability credit quality operating efficiency leverage and liquidity using available financial and regulatory information for each underlying collateral issuer the analysis also includes a review of historical industry default data current  near term operating conditions and the impact of macroeconomic and regulatory changes using the results of the analysis the company estimates appropriate default and recovery probabilities for each piece of collateral then estimates the expected cash flows for each security the fair value of each security is obtained by discounting the expected cash flows at a market discount rate the market discount rate is determined by reference to yields observed in the market for similarly rated collateralized debt obligations specifically highyield collateralized loan obligations the relatively high market discount rate is reflective of the uncertainty of the cash flows and illiquid nature of these securities the large differential between the fair value and amortized cost of some of the securities reflects the high market discount rate and the expectation that the majority of the cash flows will not be received until near the final maturity of the security the final maturities range from 2032 to 2035the following table summarizes the relevant characteristics of the companys cdo securities portfolio which are included in assetbacked securities at december 31 2016 and 2015 each security is part of a pool of issuers and supports

charges other ancillary revenues costs to service and other economic factors changes in the assumptions used may have a significant impact on the valuation of msrsmsr values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be greatly impacted by the level of

annual amount that is at least equal to the minimum funding requirements but not more than the amount deductible under the internal revenue code although not required huntington made a 150 million contribution to the plan in the third quarter of 2016 in addition huntington has an unfunded defined benefit postretirement plan that provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees who have attained the age of 55 and have at least 10 years of vesting service under this plan for any employee retiring on or after january 1 1993 postretirement healthcare benefits are based upon the employees number of months of service and are limited to the actual cost of coverage life insurance benefits are a percentage of the employees base salary at the time of retirement with a maximum of 50000 of coverage the employer paid portion of the postretirement health and life insurance plan was eliminated for employees retiring on and after march 1 2010 eligible employees retiring on and after march 1 2010 who elect retiree medical coverage will pay the full cost of this coverage huntington will not provide any employer paid life insurance to employees retiring on and

allowance was based on the uncertainty of forecasted state taxable income 162table of contentsexpected in applicable jurisdictions in order to utilize the state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards based on current analysis of both positive and negative evidence and projected forecasted taxable income within applicable jurisdictions the company believes that it is

assets and liabilities following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchyloans held for salehuntington has elected to apply the fair value option for mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell which are included in loans held for sale mortgage loans held for sale are classified as level 2 and are estimated using security prices for similar product typesloans held for investmentcertain mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell have been reclassified to mortgage loans held for investment these loans continue to be measured at fair value the fair value is determined using fair value of similar mortgagebacked securities adjusted for loan specific variableshuntington elected the fair value option for consumer loans with deteriorated credit quality acquired from firstmerit in accordance with asc 825 management decided to elect the fair value option on these consumer loans to allow for operational efficiencies not normally associated with purchased credit impaired loans the consumer loans are classified as level 3 the key assumption used to determine the fair value of the consumer loans is discounted cash flows availableforsale securities and trading account securitiessecurities accounted for at fair value include both the availableforsale and trading portfolios huntington uses prices obtained from thirdparty pricing services and recent trades to determine the fair value of securities afs and trading securities are classified as level 1 using quoted market prices unadjusted in active markets for identical securities that huntington has the ability to access at the measurement date less than 1 of the positions in these portfolios are level 1 and consist of us treasury securities and money market mutual funds when quoted market prices are not available fair values are classified as level 2 using quoted prices for similar assets in active markets quoted prices of identical or similar assets in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 81 of the positions in these portfolios are level 2 and consist of us government and agency debt securities agency mortgage backed securities assetbacked securities other than the cdopreferred securities portfolio certain municipal securities and other securities for level 2 securities management uses various methods and techniques to corroborate prices obtained from the pricing service including references to dealer or other market quotes and by reviewing valuations of comparable instruments if relevant market prices are limited or unavailable valuations may require significant management judgment or estimation to determine fair value in which case the fair values are classified as level 3 19 of our positions are level 3 and consist of cdopreferred securities and municipal securities a significant change in the unobservable inputs for these securities may result in a significant change in the ending fair value measurement of these securitiesthe municipal securities portion that is classified as level 3 uses significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the fair value is determined by utilizing thirdparty valuation services the thirdparty service provider reviews credit worthiness prevailing market rates analysis of similar securities and projected cash flows the thirdparty service provider also incorporates industry and general economic conditions into their analysis huntington evaluates the analysis provided for reasonablenessthe cdopreferred securities portfolios are classified as level 3 and as such use significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the cdopreferred securities portfolio are subjected to a quarterly review of the projected cash flows these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties and are used as a basis for impairment analysis163table of contentscdopreferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies a cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio we engage a thirdparty pricing specialist with direct industry experience in cdopreferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio the pd of each issuer and the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value the company evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the thirdparty pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter actual defaults and deferrals in the current period and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value msrsmsrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices accordingly the fair value of these assets is classified as level 3 huntington determines the fair value of msrs using an income approach model based upon the monthend interest rate curve and prepayment assumptions the model utilizes assumptions to estimate future net servicing income cash flows including estimates of time decay payoffs and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions servicing brokers and other sources of information eg discussion with other mortgage servicers and industry surveys are used to obtain information on market practice and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis thirdparty marks are obtained from at least one servicing broker huntington reviews the valuation assumptions against this market data for reasonableness and adjusts the assumptions if deemed appropriate any recommended change in assumptions andor inputs are presented for review to the mortgage price risk subcommittee for final approvalderivative assets and liabilitiesderivatives classified as level 2 consist of foreign exchange and commodity contracts which are valued using exchange traded swaps and futures market data in addition level 2 includes interest rate contracts which are valued using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates current market interest rates level 2 also includes exchange traded options and forward commitments to deliver mortgagebacked securities which are valued using quoted pricesderivatives classified as level 3 consist of interest rate lock agreements related to mortgage loan commitments the determination of fair value includes assumptions related to the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan which is a significant unobservable assumption a significant increase or decrease in the external market price would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurementshortterm borrowingsshortterm borrowings classified as level 2 consist primarily of us treasury bond securities sold under agreement to repurchase

unobservable inputs such relationships have not been included in the discussion belowa significant change in the unobservable inputs may result in a significant change in the ending fair value measurement of level 3 instruments in general prepayment rates increase when market interest rates decline and decrease when market interest rates rise and higher prepayment rates generally result in lower fair values for msr assets assetbacked securities and automobile loanscredit loss estimates such as probability of default constant default cumulative default loss given default cure given deferral and loss severity are driven by the ability of the borrowers to pay their loans and the value of the underlying collateral and are impacted by changes in macroeconomic conditions typically increasing when economic conditions worsen and decreasing when conditions improve an increase in the estimated prepayment rate typically results in a decrease in estimated credit losses and vice versa higher credit loss estimates generally result in lower fair values credit spreads generally increase when liquidity risks and market volatility increase and decrease when liquidity conditions and

mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights deposit base and other customer relationship intangibles are not considered financial instruments and are not included above accordingly this fair value information is not intended to and does not represent huntingtons underlying value many of the assets and liabilities subject to the disclosure requirements are not actively traded requiring fair values to be estimated 172table of contentsby management these estimations necessarily involve the use of judgment about a wide variety of factors including but not limited to relevancy of market prices of comparable instruments expected future cash flows and appropriate discount ratesthe following methods and assumptions were used by huntington to estimate the fair value of the remaining classes of financial instrumentsheldtomaturity securitiesfair values are determined by using models that are based on securityspecific details as well as relevant industry and economic factors the most significant of these inputs are quoted market prices and interest rate spreads on relevant benchmark securitiesloans and direct financing leasesvariablerate loans that reprice frequently are based on carrying amounts as adjusted for estimated credit losses the fair values for other loans and leases are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and employ interest rates currently being offered for loans and leases with similar terms the rates take into account the position of the yield curve as well as an adjustment for prepayment risk operating costs and profit this value is also reduced by an estimate of expected losses and the credit risk associated in the loan and lease portfolio the valuation of the loan portfolio reflected discounts that huntington believed are consistent with transactions occurring in the marketplacedepositsdemand deposits savings accounts and money market deposits are by definition equal to the amount payable on demand the fair values of fixedrate time deposits are estimated by discounting cash flows using interest rates currently being offered on certificates with similar maturitiesdebtlongterm debt is based upon quoted market prices which are inclusive of huntingtons credit risk in the absence of quoted market prices discounted cash flows using market rates for similar debt with the same maturities are used in the determination of fair value19 derivative financial instrumentsderivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities respectively and measured at fair valuederivative financial instruments can be designated as accounting hedges under gaap designating a derivative as an accounting hedge allows huntington to recognize gains and losses less any ineffectiveness in the income statement within the same period that the hedged item affects earnings gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated to an effective hedge relationship under gaap immediately impact earnings within the period they occur derivatives used in asset and liability management activitieshuntington engages in balance sheet hedging activity principally for asset liability management purposes to convert fixed rate assets or liabilities into floating rate or vice versa balance sheet hedging activity is arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment and is classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges fair value hedges are purchased to convert deposits and subordinated and other longterm debt from fixedrate obligations to floating rate cash flow hedges are also used to convert floating rate loans made to customers into fixed rate loansthe following table presents the gross notional values

counterparties with substantially matching terms and currencies in order to economically hedge significant exposure related to derivatives used in trading activitiesthe interest rate risk of customer derivatives is mitigated by entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with other counterparties the credit risk to these customers is evaluated and included in the calculation of fair

that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a

primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements including commercial paper bond financing and similar transactions most of these arrangements mature within two years the carrying amount of deferred revenue associated with these guarantees was 8 million and 7 million at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 respectivelycommercial lettersofcredit represent shortterm

31 2016 and 2015 huntington had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of 819 million and 659 million respectively these contracts mature in less than one yearlitigationthe nature of huntingtons business ordinarily results in a certain amount of pending as well as threatened claims litigation investigations regulatory and legal and administrative cases matters and proceedings all of which are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business when the company determines it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted it vigorously defends itself the company considers settlement of cases when in managements judgment it is in the best interests of both the company and its shareholders to do soon at least a quarterly basis huntington assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with threatened and outstanding legal cases matters and proceedings utilizing the latest information available for cases matters and proceedings where it is both probable the company will incur a loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated huntington establishes an accrual for the loss once established the accrual is adjusted as appropriate to reflect any relevant developments for cases matters or proceedings where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated no accrual is establishedin certain cases matters and proceedings exposure to loss exists in excess of the accrual to the extent such loss is reasonably possible but not probable management believes an estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued for current legal proceedings is up to 65 million at december 31 2016 for certain other cases and matters management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss at this time any estimate involves significant judgment given the varying stages of the proceedings including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages the existence of multiple defendants in several of the current proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined the numerous unresolved issues in many of the proceedings and the inherent uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings accordingly managements estimate will change from timetotime and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimatewhile the final outcome of legal cases matters and proceedings is inherently uncertain based on information currently available advice of counsel and available insurance coverage management believes that the amount it has already accrued is adequate and any incremental liability arising from the companys legal cases matters or proceedings will not have a material negative adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position as a whole however in the event of unexpected future developments it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these cases matters and proceedings if unfavorable may be material to the companys consolidated financial position in a particular period182table of contentsmeoli v the huntington national bank cyberco litigation the bank has been named a defendant in a lawsuit arising from the

duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury  other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury  other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilitiesconsumer and business banking  the consumer and business banking segment provides a wide array of financial products and
