noninterestbearing funds partially offset by an 11 basis point increase in funding costs the provision for credit losses was 191 million up 91 million or 91 the higher provision expense was due to several factors including the migration of the acquired portfolio to the originated portfolio and the corresponding reserve build portfolio growth and transitioning the firstmerit portfolio to

interest income from earning assets primarily loans securities and direct financing leases and interest expense of funding sources primarily interestbearing deposits and borrowings earning asset balances and related funding sources as well as changes in the levels of interest rates impact net interest income the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interestbearing liabilities is the net interest spread noninterestbearing sources of funds such as demand deposits and shareholders equity also support earning assets the impact of the noninterestbearing sources of funds often referred to as free funds is captured in the net interest margin which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a fullytaxable equivalent basis which means that taxfree interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income assuming a 35 tax

comprehensive discussion of risk management and capital matters affecting us can be found in the risk governance section included in item 1a and the regulatory matters section of item 1 of this form 10ksome of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit market liquidity operational and compliance risks are described in the following sectionscredit riskcredit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending we also have credit risk associated with our afs and htm securities portfolios see note 5 and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management mortgage banking and trading activities while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity based on our underwriting practices we believe this exposure is minimal see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statementswe continue to focus on the identification monitoring and managing of our credit risk in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes market risk management activities and portfolio diversification we use quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources enhanced use of modeling technology and internal stress testing processes our portfolio management resources demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile in our efforts to continue to identify risk mitigation techniques we have focused on product design features origination policies and solutions for delinquent or stressed borrowers 43table of contentsthe maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers all authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type geography industry and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives although we offer a broad set of products we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk portfolio profilethe checks and balances in the credit process and the separation of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and provide for effective problem asset management and resolution for example we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage positionloan and lease credit exposure mixat december 31 2016 our loans and leases totaled 670 billion representing a 166 billion or 33 increase compared to 503 billion at december 31 2015 total commercial loans and leases were 354 billion at december 31 2016 and

other projects the majority of these borrowers are customers doing business within our geographic regions campi loans and leases are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company andor the personal guarantee of the business owners the financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a campi loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral this treatment is a result of the credit decision process which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt the operation sale rental or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans as we have expanded our campi portfolio we have developed a series of vertical specialties to ensure that new products or lending types are embedded within a structured centralized commercial lending area with designated experienced credit officers these specialties are comprised of either targeted industries for example healthcare food amp agribusiness energy etc andor lending disciplines equipment finance abl etc all of which requires a high degree of expertise and oversight to effectively mitigate and monitor risk as such we have dedicated colleagues and teams focused on bringing value added expertise to these specialty clients cre  cre loans consist of loans to developers and reits supporting incomeproducing or forsale commercial real estate properties we mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement these loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings office and industrial buildings and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation sale or refinance of the property for loans secured by real estate appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirementsconstruction cre  construction cre loans are loans to developers companies or individuals used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be

commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower assessment of the borrowers management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process we utilize a centralized preview and senior loan approval committee led by our chief credit officer the risk rating see next paragraph size and complexity of the credit determines the threshold for approval of the senior loan committee with a minimum credit exposure of 100 million for loans not requiring senior loan committee approval with the exception of small business loans credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority for small business loans we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures in this centralized decision environment certain individuals who understand each local region may make creditextension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities in which we operate in addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval processin commercial lending ongoing credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan we monitor all significant exposures on an ongoing basis all commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrowers pd and lgd this twodimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process the pd is rated and applied at the borrower level the lgd is rated and applied based on the specific type of credit extension and the quality and lien position associated with the underlying collateral the internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each periodic monitoring event there is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an ongoing basis we continually review and adjust our riskrating criteria based on actual experience which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate allowance for credit losses acl amount for the commercial portfolio a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio including small business loans to provide consistent oversightin addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and risk of new loan originations this group is part of our risk management area and conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans validate risk ratings and test the consistency of credit processesour standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment one of which is guarantor support on an annual basis or more frequently if warranted we consider among other things the guarantors reputation and creditworthiness along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth assuming such information is available our assessment of the guarantors credit strength or lack thereof is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans which is directly tied to and an integral component of our acl methodology when a loan goes to impaired status viable guarantor support is considered in the determination of a credit loss47table of contentsif our assessment of the guarantors credit strength yields an inherent capacity to

terms however there are times when subsequent modifications are required such as when the modified loan matures often the loans are performing in accordance with the tdr terms and a new note is originated with similar modified terms these loans are subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing if the loan is not performing in accordance with the existing tdr terms typically an individualized approach to repayment is established in accordance with gaap the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan a new loan is considered for removal of the tdr designation a continuation of the prior note requires the continuation of the tdr designation and because the refinanced note constitutes a new or amended debt instrument it is included in our tdr activity table below as a new tdr and a restructured tdr removal during the periodthe types of concessions granted for existing tdrs are consistent with those granted on new tdrs and include interest rate reductions amortization or maturity date changes beyond what the collateral supports and principal forgiveness based on the borrowers specific needs at a point in time our policy does not limit the number of times a loan may be modified a loan may be modified multiple times if it is considered to be in the best interest of both the borrower and uscommercial loans are not automatically considered to be accruing tdrs upon the granting of a new concession if the loan is in accruing status and no loss is expected based on the modified terms the modified tdr remains in accruing status for loans that are on nonaccrual status before the modification collection of both principal and interest must not be in doubt and the borrower must be able to exhibit sufficient cash flows for at least a sixmonth period of time to service the debt in order to return to accruing status this sixmonth period could extend before or after the restructure dateany granted change in terms or conditions that are not readily available in the market for that borrower requires the designation as a tdr there are no provisions for the removal of the tdr designation based on payment activity for consumer loans a loan may be returned to accrual status when all contractually due interest and principal has been paid and the borrower demonstrates the financial capacity to continue to pay as agreed with the risk of loss diminished during the 2016 third quarter huntington transferred 81

determining the appropriateness of the acl the alll represents the estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reported date additions to the alll result from recording provision expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting from loan riskrating downgrades while reductions reflect chargeoffs net of recoveries decreased risk levels resulting from loan riskrating upgrades or the sale of loans the aulc is determined by applying the same quantitative reserve determination process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statementsthe acquired loans were recorded at their fair value as of the acquisition date and the prior alll was eliminated an alll for acquired loans is estimated using a methodology similar to that used for originated loans the allowance determined for each acquired loan is compared to the remaining fair value adjustment for that loan if the computed allowance is greater the excess is added to the allowance through a provision for loan losses if the computed allowance is less no additional allowance is recognizedour acl evaluation process

2amounts presented above exclude writedowns of loans transferred to loans heldforsalein assessing nco trends it is helpful to understand the process of how commercial loans are treated as they deteriorate over time the alll established is consistent with the level of risk associated with the original underwriting as a part of our normal portfolio management process for commercial loans the loan is periodically reviewed and the alll is increased or decreased based on the updated risk rating in certain cases the standard alll is determined to not be appropriate and a specific reserve is established based on the projected cash flow or collateral value of the specific loan chargeoffs if necessary are generally recognized in a period after the specific alll was established if the previously established alll exceeds that necessary to satisfactorily resolve the problem loan a reduction in the overall level of the alll could be recognized consumer loans are treated in much the same manner as commercial loans with increasing reserve factors applied based on the risk characteristics of the loan although specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans in summary if loan quality deteriorates the typical credit sequence would be periods of reserve building followed by periods of higher ncos as the previously established alll is utilized additionally an increase in the alll either precedes or is in conjunction with increases in nals when a loan is classified as nal it is evaluated for specific alll or chargeoff as a result an increase in nals does not necessarily result in an increase in the alll or an expectation of higher future ncosall residential mortgage loans greater than 150days past due are chargeddown to the estimated value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs the remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed or the loan goes through the foreclosure process 2016 versus 2015 ncos

losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices including the correlation among these factors and their volatility when the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors the holder faces market risk we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiary foreign exchange positions equity investments and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans61table of contentsinterest rate riskoverviewwe actively manage interest rate risk as changes in market interest rates can have a significant impact on reported earnings changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of our financial instruments cash flows and net interest income we seek to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates alco oversees market risk management establishing risk measures limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital according to these policies responsibility for measuring and the management of interest rate risk resides in the corporate treasury group interest rate risk on our balance sheet consists of reprice option and basis risks reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing of asset and liability portfolios option risk arises from embedded options present in the investment portfolio and in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options deposit early withdrawal options and interest rate options these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for us basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices which subsequently result in a narrowing of profit spread on an earning asset or liability basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities such as interestbearing checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates the interest rate risk position is measured and monitored using risk management tools including earnings simulation modeling and eve sensitivity analysis which capture both shortterm and longterm interest rate risk exposures combining the results from these separate risk measurement processes allows a reasonably comprehensive view of our shortterm and longterm interest rate riskinterest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the alco monthly and roc at least quarterly the information reported includes periodend results and identifies any policy limits exceeded along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution mitigation or assumption of the riskwe use two approaches to model interest rate risk net interest income at risk nii at risk and evenii at risk uses net interest income simulation analysis which involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios including changes in the level of interest rates the shape of the yield curve and spreads between market interest rates the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is measured using numerous interest rate scenarios including shocks gradual ramps curve flattening curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rates scenarios modeling the sensitivity of net interest earnings to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process to the extent that actual performance is different than what was assumed actual net interest earnings sensitivity may be different than projected the assumptions used in the models are our best estimates based on studies conducted by the treasury department the treasury department uses a data warehouse to study interest rate risk at a transactional level and uses various adhoc reports to refine assumptions continuously assumptions and methodologies regarding administered rate liabilities eg savings money market and interestbearing checking accounts balance trends and repricing relationships reflect our best estimate of expected behavior and these assumptions are reviewed regularlywe also have longerterm interest rate risk exposure which may not be appropriately measured by earnings sensitivity analysis alco uses economic value of equity at risk modeling or eve sensitivity analysis to study the impact of longterm cash flows on earnings and capital eve involves discounting present values of all cash flows of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios the discounted present value of all cash flows represents our eve the analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario which will impact the discounted present value the amount of basecase measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow us to measure longerterm repricing and option risk in the balance sheettable 20  net interest income at risk       net interest income at risk basis point change scenario25 100 200board policy limits  20  40 december 31 201610  27  56 december 31 201503

for rising interest rates msrsthis section should be read in conjunction with note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statementsat december 31 2016 we had a total of 186 million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service 189 billion in mortgage loans of this 186 million 137 million was recorded using the fair value method and 1725 million was recorded using the amortization methodmsr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be reduced by prepayments prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise we have employed hedging strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment however volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges we report msr fair value adjustments net of hedgerelated trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking incomemsrs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with historically low interest rates resulting in a lower probability of prepayments and ultimately impairment msr assets are included in servicing rights in the consolidated financial statements63table of contentsprice riskprice risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting we have price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiary foreign exchange positions equity investments and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held liquidity riskliquidity risk is the possibility of us being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner liquidity is managed to ensure stable reliable and costeffective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities we consider core earnings strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings which allows us costeffective access to marketbased liquidity we rely on a large stable core deposit base and a diversified base of wholesale funding sources to manage liquidity risk the alco is appointed by the roc to oversee liquidity risk management and the establishment of liquidity risk policies and limits the treasury department is responsible for identifying measuring and monitoring our liquidity profile the position is evaluated daily weekly and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future months and identifying sources and uses of funds the overall management of our liquidity position is also integrated into retail and commercial pricing policies to ensure a stable core deposit base liquidity risk is reviewed and managed continuously for the bank and the parent company as well as its subsidiaries in addition liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions provide policy guidance review funding strategies and oversee the adherence to and maintenance of the contingency funding plansour primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base core deposits comprised approximately 94 of total deposits at december 31 2016 we also have available unused wholesale sources of liquidity including advances from the fhlb of cincinnati issuance through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers liquidity is further provided by unencumbered or unpledged investment securities that totaled 150 billion as of december 31 2016 the treasury department also prepares a contingency funding plan that details the potential erosion of funds in the event of a systemic financial market crisis or institutionalspecific stress scenario an example of an institution specific event would be a downgrade in our public credit rating by a rating agency due to factors such as deterioration in asset quality a large charge to earnings a decline in profitability or other financial measures or a significant merger or acquisition examples of systemic events unrelated to us that could have an effect on our access to liquidity would be terrorism or war natural disasters political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources the liquidity contingency plan therefore outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles

include commitments to extend credit interest rate swaps financial guarantees contained in standby lettersofcredit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loanscommitments to extend creditcommitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates are variablerate and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly shortterm variablerate nature see note 21 for

huntington private client group rbhpcg and home lending a treasury  other function includes technology and operations other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expense business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutionson august 16 2016 we completed our acquisition

sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocationsexpense allocationthe management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all five business segments from treasury  other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury  other expenses except reported significant items and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the five business segmentsfunds transfer pricing ftpwe use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury  other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury  other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilities75table of contentsnet income by business segmentnet income by business segment for the past three years is presented in the following table

results of operations or financial position where nongaap financial measures are used the comparable gaap financial measure as well as the reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure can be found herein significant itemsfrom timetotime revenue expenses or taxes are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities andor by items that while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or shortterm in nature we refer to such items as significant items most often these significant items result from factors originating outside the company eg regulatory actions  assessments windfall gains changes in accounting principles onetime tax assessments  refunds litigation actions etc in other cases they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business eg merger  restructuring charges recapitalization actions goodwill impairment etceven though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions as a general rule volatility alone does not define a significant item for example changes in the provision for credit losses gains  losses from investment activities asset valuation writedowns etc reflect ordinary banking activities and are therefore typically excluded from consideration as a significant itemwe believe the disclosure of significant items provides a better understanding of our performance and trends to ascertain which of such items if any to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance ie within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations as well as how if at all to adjust estimates of future performance accordingly to this end we adopted a practice of listing significant items in our external disclosure documents eg earnings press releases investor presentations forms 10q and 10ksignificant items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performancefullytaxable equivalent basisinterest income yields and ratios on a fte basis are considered nongaap financial measures management believes net interest income on a fte basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes the fte basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and taxexempt sources the fte basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent we encourage readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10k in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measurenonregulatory capital ratiosin addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy includingtangible common equity to tangible assets andtangible common equity to riskweighted assets using basel iii definitions93table of contentsthese nonregulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the companys capitalization to other financial services companies these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies these ratios are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap or federal banking regulations as a result these nonregulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company are considered nongaap financial measuresbecause there are no standardized definitions for these nonregulatory capital ratios the companys calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies also there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors as a result the company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10k

by reference into the mdampacritical accounting policies and use of significant estimatesour consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference into this mdampa describes the significant accounting policies we use in our consolidated financial statementsan accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed belowallowance for credit lossesour acl of 07 billion at december 31 2016 represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risk associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsvaluation of financial instrumentsassets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility assets measured at fair value include certain loans held for sale loans held for investment availableforsale and trading securities certain securitized automobile loans msrs derivatives and certain shortterm borrowings at december 31 2016 approximately 158 billion of our assets and 01 billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in addition to the above mentioned ongoing fair value measurements fair value is also used for recording business combinations and measuring other nonrecurring financial assets and liabilities at the end of each quarter we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured at fair value as necessary assets or liabilities may be transferred within fair value hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement datewhere available we use quoted market prices to determine fair value if quoted market prices are not available fair value is determined using either internally developed or independent thirdparty valuation models based on inputs that are either directly observable or derived from market data these inputs include but are not limited to interest rate yield curves option volatilities or option adjusted spreads where neither quoted market prices nor observable market data are available fair value is determined using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on managements expectation that market participants 94table of contentswould use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability the determination of appropriate unobservable inputs requires exercise of significant judgment a significant portion of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value are measured based on quoted market prices or observable market independent inputsthe following is a description of the significant estimates used in the valuation of financial assets and liabilities for which quoted market prices and observable market parameters are not availablemunicipal and assetbacked securitiesthe municipal securities portion that is classified as level 3 uses significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the fair value is determined by utilizing thirdparty valuation services the thirdparty service provider reviews credit worthiness prevailing market rates analysis of similar securities and projected cash flows the thirdparty service provider also incorporates industry and general economic conditions into their analysis huntington evaluates the analysis provided for reasonablenessour cdo preferred securities portfolios are measured at fair value using a valuation methodology involving use of significant unobservable inputs and are thus classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy the private label cmo securities portfolio is subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows while the cash flows of our cdo preferred securities portfolio is reviewed quarterly these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties and are used as a basis for impairment analysiscdo preferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio we engage a thirdparty pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooledtrustpreferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio the pd of each issuer and the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value management evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the thirdparty pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter actual defaults and deferrals in the current period and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with asc 820derivatives used for hedging purposesderivatives designated as qualified hedges are tested for hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis assessments are made at the inception of the hedge and on a recurring basis to determine whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item a statistical regression analysis is performed to measure the effectivenessif based on the assessment a derivative is not expected to be a highly effective hedge or it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge hedge accounting is discontinued as of the quarter the hedge is not highly effective as the statistical regression analysis requires the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are sensitive to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates we consider this a critical accounting estimateloans held for salehuntington has elected to apply the fair value option to certain residential mortgage loans that are classified as held for sale at origination the fair value of such loans is estimated based on the inputs that include prices of mortgage backed securities adjusted for other variables such as interest rates expected credit defaults and market discount rates the adjusted value reflects the price we expect to receive from the sale of such loanscertain consumer and commercial loans are classified as held for sale and are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value the determination of fair value for these consumer loans is based on observable prices for similar products or discounted expected cash flows which takes into consideration factors such as future interest rates prepayment speeds default and loss curves and market discount rates mortgage servicing rightsretained rights to service mortgage loans are recognized as a separate and distinct asset at the time the loans are sold mortgage servicing rights msrs are initially recorded at fair value at the time the related loans are sold and subsequently remeasured at each reporting date under either the fair value or amortization method the election of the fair value or amortization method is made at the time each servicing asset is established all newly created msrs since 2009 are recorded using the amortization method any increase or decrease in fair value of msrs accounted for under the fair value method as well as any amortization andor impairment of msrs recorded under the amortization method is reflected in earnings in the period that the changes occur msrs are subject to 95table of contentsinterest rate risk in that their fair value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment fair value is determined based upon the application of an income approach valuation model we use an independent thirdparty valuation model which incorporates assumptions in estimating future cash flows these assumptions include prepayment speeds payoffs and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions the reasonableness of these pricing models is validated on a minimum of a quarterly basis by at least one independent external service broker valuation because the fair values of msrs are significantly impacted by the use of estimates the use of different assumptions can result in different estimated fair values of those msrscontingent liabilitieswe are a party to various claims litigation and legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current andor former operations we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a casebycase basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering among other factors the progress of each case or proceeding our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings and the opinions and views of legal counsel litigation exposure represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our controlincome taxesthe calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments we have two accruals for income taxes 1 our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal state and local taxing jurisdictions net of any reserve for potential audit issues and any tax refunds and the net receivable balance is reported as a component of accrued income and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 2 our deferred federal and state income tax and related valuation accounts reported as a component of accrued income and other assets represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under gaap and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under federal and state tax lawin the ordinary course of business we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes the effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws we believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements we review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions in addition we rely on various tax opinions recent tax audits and historical experiencefrom timetotime we engage in business transactions that may affect our tax liabilities where appropriate we obtain opinions of outside experts and assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking into account statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position however changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates implementation of new business strategies resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance such changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position andor results of operations see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statementsdeferred tax assetsat december 31 2016 we had a net federal deferred tax asset of 76 million and a net state deferred tax asset of 41 million a valuation allowance is provided when it is morelikelythannot some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized all available evidence both positive and negative was considered to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence impairment should be recognized our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change if our forecast of taxable income within the carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets such assets may be impaired based on our analysis of both positive and negative evidence and our ability to offset the net deferred tax assets against our forecasted future taxable income there was no impairment of the net deferred tax assets at december 31 2016 other than a valuation allowance relating to state net operating loss carryoversgoodwill and intangible assetsthe acquisition method of accounting requires that acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair values as of the date of acquisition this often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques all of which are inherently subjective acquisitions typically result in goodwill the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value which is subject to impairment testing at least annually the amortization of identified intangible assets recognized in a business combination is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received over their economic life which is also subjective customer attrition rates that are based on historical 96table of
