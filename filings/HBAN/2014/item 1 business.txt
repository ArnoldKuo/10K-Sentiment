have fewer regulatory constraints broader geographic service areas greater capital and in some cases lower cost structures in addition competition for quality customers has intensified as a result of changes in regulation advances in technology and product delivery systems consolidation among financial service providers bank failures and the conversion of certain former investment banks to bank holding companies  regulatory matters  we are subject to regulation by the sec the federal reserve the occ the cfpb and other federal and state regulators  because we are a public company we are subject to regulation by the sec the sec has established five categories of issuers for the purpose of filing periodic and annual reports under these regulations we are considered to be a large accelerated filer and as such must comply with sec accelerated reporting requirements  we are a bank holding company and are qualified as a financial holding company with the federal reserve we are subject to examination and supervision by the federal reserve pursuant to the bank holding company act we are required to file reports and other information regarding our business operations and the business operations of our subsidiaries with the federal reserve    7    table of contents the federal reserve maintains a bank holding company rating system that emphasizes risk management introduces a framework for analyzing and rating financial factors and provides a framework for assessing and rating the potential impact of nondepository entities of a holding company on its subsidiary depository institutions the ratings assigned to us like those assigned to other financial institutions are confidential and may not be disclosed except to the extent required by law  the federal reserve utilizes an updated framework for the consolidated supervision of large financial institutions including bank holding companies with consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the objectives of the framework are to enhance the resilience of a firm lower the probability of its failure and reduce the impact on the financial system in the event of an institutions failure with regard to resiliency each firm is expected to ensure that the consolidated organization and its core business lines can survive under a broad range of internal or external stresses this requires financial resilience by maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity and operational resilience by maintaining effective corporate governance risk management and recovery planning with respect to lowering the probability of failure each firm is expected to ensure the sustainability of its critical operations and banking offices under a broad range of internal or external stresses this requires among other things effective resolution planning that addresses the complexity and the interconnectivity of the firms operations  the bank which is chartered by the occ is a national bank and our only bank subsidiary it is subject to examination and supervision by the occ and also by the cfpb which was established by the doddfrank act in 2010 our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to examination and supervision by the federal reserve or in the case of nonbank subsidiaries of the bank by the occ all subsidiaries are subject to examination and supervision by the cfpb to the extent they offer any consumer financial products or services our subsidiaries are subject to examination by other federal and state agencies including in the case of certain securities and investment management activities regulation by the sec and the financial industry regulatory authority  the bank is subject to affiliate transaction restrictions under federal law which limit certain transactions generally involving the transfer of funds by a bank or its subsidiaries to its parent corporation or any nonbank subsidiary of its parent corporation whether in the form of loans extensions of credit investments or asset purchases or otherwise undertaking certain obligations on behalf of such affiliates see also the volcker rule discussion below for additional affiliate transaction restrictions  legislative and regulatory reforms continue to have significant impacts throughout the financial services industry  the doddfrank act enacted in 2010 is complex and broad in scope and several of its provisions are still being implemented the doddfrank act established the cfpb which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services and the financial stability oversight council which has oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk in addition the doddfrank act altered the authority and duties of the federal banking and securities regulatory agencies implemented certain corporate governance requirements for all public companies including financial institutions with regard to executive compensation proxy access by shareholders and certain whistleblower provisions and restricted certain proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks and their affiliates the doddfrank act also required the issuance of numerous implementing regulations many of which have not yet been issued the regulations will continue to take effect over several more years continuing to make it difficult to anticipate the overall impact to us our customers or the financial industry in general  in midjanuary 2013 the cfpb issued eight final regulations governing mainly consumer mortgage lending the first of these rules was issued on january 10 2013 and included the ability to repay and qualified mortgage rule this rule imposes additional requirements on lenders including rules designed to require lenders to ensure borrowers ability to repay their mortgage and took effect january 10 2014 the same day the cfpb also finalized a rule on escrow accounts for higher priced mortgage loans and a rule expanding the scope of the highcost mortgage provision in the truth in lending act on january 17 2013 the cfpb issued its final rules implementing provisions of the doddfrank act that relate to mortgage servicing which took effect on january 10 2014 on january 18 2013 the cfpb issued a final appraisal rule under the equal credit opportunity act and six agencies including the cfpb frb occ fdic ncua and fhfa issued an interagency rule on appraisals for higherpriced mortgage loans on november 20 2013 the cfpb issued its final rule on integrated mortgage disclosures under the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act for which compliance is required by august 1 2015 we are evaluating these integrated mortgage disclosure rules to determine their impact on the bank and its affiliates  during the 2013 first quarter the cfpb provided guidance on fair lending practices to indirect automobile lenders with recommendations to ensure compliance with fair lending laws  recently banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address unethical or otherwise bad business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law prior to the doddfrank act there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with the unfair or deceptive acts or practices udap law however the udap provisions have been expanded under the doddfrank act to apply to unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices which has been delegated to the cfpb for supervision    8    table of contents large bank holding companies and national banks are required to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve and occ respectively and conduct stress tests  the federal reserve published final amendments to regulation y to require large bank holding companies to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and to require such bank holding companies to obtain approval from the federal reserve under certain circumstances before making a capital distribution this rule applies to us and all other bank holding companies with 50 billion or more of total consolidated assets  a large bank holding companys capital plan must include an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over at least the next nine quarters a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon a detailed description of the entitys process for assessing capital adequacy the entitys capital policy and a discussion of any expected changes to the banking holding companys business plan that are likely to have a material impact on the firms capital adequacy or liquidity the planning horizon for the most recent capital planning and stress testing cycle encompasses the 2013 fourth quarter through the 2015 fourth quarter as was submitted in our capital plan in january 2014 rules to implement the basel iii capital reforms in the united states were finalized in july 2013 and will be phasedin beginning in 2015 for us under the standardized approach as such the most recent ccar cycle which began october 1 2013 overlaps with the implementation of the basel iii capital reforms based on the required nine quarter projection horizon the interim final rules clarify that banking organizations with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including us must incorporate the revised capital framework into the capital planning projections and into the stress tests required under the doddfrank act the rule also clarifies that for the upcoming cycle capital adequacy at large banking organizations including us would continue to be assessed against a minimum 5 percent tier 1 common ratio as calculated by the federal reserve  capital plans for 2014 were required to be submitted by january 6 2014 the federal reserve will either object to a capital plan in whole or in part or provide a notice of nonobjection no later than march 31 2014 for plans submitted by the january 6 2014 submission date if the federal reserve objects to a capital plan the bank holding company may not make any capital distributions other than those with respect to which the federal reserve has indicated its nonobjection while we can give no assurances as to the outcome or specific interactions with the regulators based on the capital plan we submitted on january 5 2014 we believe we have a strong capital position and that our capital adequacy process is robust  in addition to the ccar submission section 165 of the doddfrank act requires that national banks like the huntington national bank conduct annual stress tests for submission in january 2014 the results of the stress tests will provide the occ with forwardlooking information that will be used in bank supervision and will assist the agency in assessing a companys risk profile and capital adequacy we submitted our stress test results to the occ on january 6 2014  the regulatory capital rules indicate that common stockholders equity should be the dominant element within tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on noncommon equity elements under the doddfrank act the ratio of tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets became significant as a measurement of the predominance of common equity in tier 1 capital and an indication of the quality of capital  final rules have been issued to implement the volcker rule  on december 10 2013 the federal reserve the occ the fdic the cftc and the sec issued final rules to implement the volcker rule contained in section 619 of the doddfrank act generally to become effective on july 21 2015 the volcker rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates referred to as banking entities from i engaging in proprietary trading and ii investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds covered funds subject to certain limited exceptions these prohibitions impact the ability of us banking entities to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with nonus banking organizations in overseas markets the rule also effectively prohibits shortterm trading strategies by any us banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for trading  the final volcker rule regulations do provide certain exemptions allowing banking entities to continue underwriting marketmaking and hedging activities and trading certain government obligations as well as various exemptions and exclusions from the definition of covered funds the level of required compliance activity depends on the size of the banking entity and the extent of its trading ceos of larger banking entities including huntington will have to attest annually in writing that their organization has in place processes to establish maintain enforce review test and modify compliance with the volcker rule regulations banking entities with significant permitted trading operations will have to report certain quantitative information beginning between june 30 2014 and december 31 2016 depending on the size of the banking entitys trading assets and liabilities  on january 14 2014 the five federal agencies approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of the volcker rule under the interim final rule the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities if certain qualifications are met in addition the agencies released a nonexclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of    9    table of contents  the interim final rule at december 31 2013 we had investments in ten different pools of trust preferred securities eight of our pools are included in the list of nonexclusive issuers we have analyzed the other two pools that were not included on the list and believe that we will continue to be able to own these investments under the final volcker rule regulations  the rules effecting debit card interchange fees under the durbin amendment which became effective on october 1 2011 have negatively impacted our electronic banking income  the durbin amendment which was section 1075 of the doddfrank act required the federal reserve to establish a cap on the rate merchants pay banks for electronic clearing of debit transactions ie the interchange rate the federal reserve issued final rules effective october 1 2011 for establishing standards including a cap for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions the final rule established standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers were reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions under the final rule the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction a 1 cent fraud prevention adjustment and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction as a result of implementing this lower debit card interchange fee structure our electronic banking income was negatively impacted by over 55 million in 2012 when compared to 2011  on july 31 2013 the federal district court in the district of columbia issued a ruling in a lawsuit filed by a merchant group challenging the validity of the federal reserves final rule under the durbin amendment the court ruling vacated the provisions of the federal reserves final rule relating to standards for debit card interchange fees and the provision dealing with network nonexclusivity but stayed its action until further briefing on issues identified by the court eventually the district courts ruling was appealed to the federal circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia where the case is currently pending if the court of appeals rules in favor of the merchants the federal reserve will likely be required to provide even more stringent caps on debit interchange fees which could adversely impact all banks that issue debit cards including us and which could result in an industrywide retraction of debit card products and replacement with other card products not subject to the durbin amendment the federal reserve and a banking trade organization are submitting briefs arguing that the court of appeals should overrule the district court and uphold the federal reserves final rule under the durbin amendment oral argument before the court of appeals was held on january 17 2014 and an expedited ruling is anticipated  there are restrictions on our ability to pay dividends  dividends from the bank to the parent company are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders however there are statutory limits on the amount of dividends that the bank can pay to the holding company regulatory approval is required prior to the declaration of any dividends in an amount greater than its undivided profits or if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus or common stock as a result of the deficit position of its undivided profits prior to december 31 2013 the bank could not have declared and paid any cash dividends to the parent company without regulatory approval  since the first quarter of 2008 the bank has made a capital reduction each quarter to enable payment of periodic dividends to shareholders outside the banks consolidated group on preferred and common stock of its reit and capital financing subsidiaries we anticipate that those subsidiaries and the bank will be able to resume normal dividend payments during the first half of 2014  if in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice such authority may require after notice and hearing that such bank cease and desist from such practice depending on the financial condition of the bank the applicable regulatory authority might deem us to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice if the bank were to pay dividends the federal reserve and the occ have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings additionally the federal reserve may prohibit bank holding companies from making any capital distributions including payment of preferred and common dividends if the federal reserve objects to the annual capital plan  we are subject to the current capital requirements mandated by the federal reserve and final capital rules to implement basel iii that were adopted in july 2013  the federal reserve sets riskbased capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies under the guidelines and related policies bank holding companies must maintain capital sufficient to meet both a riskbased asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis the riskbased ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet commitments into four weighted categories with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived as representing greater risk the riskbased ratio represents total capital divided by total riskweighted assets the leverage ratio is core capital divided by total assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines the bank is subject to substantially similar capital requirements    10    table of contents on july 2 2013 the federal reserve voted to adopt final capital rules implementing basel iii requirements for us banking organizations the final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the united states the basel iii regulatory capital reforms from the basel committee on banking supervision and certain changes required by the doddfrank act under the final rule minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations consistent with the international basel framework the final rule includes a new minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital tier i common to riskweighted assets and a tier 1 common capital conservation buffer of 25 of riskweighted assets that will apply to all supervised financial institutions the rule also raises the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4 for all banking organizations these new minimum capital ratios will become effective for us on january 1 2015 and will be fully phasedin on january 1 2019  following are the basel iii regulatory capital levels that we must satisfy to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments during the applicable transition period from january 1 2015 until january 1 2019                                basel iii regulatory capital levels        january 12015     january 12016     january 12017     january 12018     january 12019     tier 1 common     45       5125       575       6375       70     tier 1 riskbased capital ratio     60       6625       725       7875       85     total riskbased capital ratio     80       8625       925       9875       105    the final rule emphasizes tier 1 common capital the most lossabsorbing form of capital and implements strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments the final rule also improves the methodology for calculating riskweighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity banks and regulators use risk weighting to assign different levels of risk to different classes of assets  we have evaluated the impact of the basel iii final rule on our regulatory capital ratios and estimate a reduction of approximately 60 basis points to our basel i tier i common riskbased capital ratio based on our june 30 2013 balance sheet composition the estimate is based on managements current interpretation expectations and understanding of the final us basel iii rules we anticipate that our capital ratios on a basel iii basis will continue to exceed the well capitalized minimum capital requirements we are evaluating options to mitigate the capital impact of the final rule prior to its effective implementation date  based on our review of the basel iii final rule it is likely that when basel iii becomes effective the hpci class c preferred securities will no longer constitute tier 1 capital for us or the bank as such we determined that a regulatory capital event had occurred based on an opinion of counsel rendered by a law firm experienced in such matters and the hpci board of directors determined to redeem the outstanding class c preferred securities hpci redeemed all 50 million of the class c preferred securities on december 31 2013 the holders of such securities received the redemption price of 2500 per share  based on the final basel iii rule banking organizations with more than 15 billion in total consolidated assets are required to phaseout of additional tier 1 capital any nonqualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred shares issued before september 12 2010 we will begin the additional tier i capital phaseout our trust preferred securities in 2015 but will be able to include these instruments in tier ii capital as a nonadvanced approaches institution  generally under the currently applicable guidelines a financial institutions capital is divided into two tiers institutions that must incorporate market risk exposure into their riskbased capital requirements may also have a third tier of capital in the form of restricted shortterm subordinated debt these tiers are            tier 1 riskbased capital or core capital which includes total equity plus qualifying capital securities and minority interests excluding unrealized gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income and nonqualifying intangible and servicing assets            tier 2 riskbased capital or supplementary capital which includes among other things cumulative and limitedlife preferred stock mandatory convertible securities qualifying subordinated debt and the acl up to 125 of riskweighted assets            total riskbased capital is the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 riskbased capital  the federal reserve and the other federal banking regulators require that all intangible assets net of deferred tax except originated or purchased msrs nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships intangible assets be deducted from tier 1 capital however the total amount of these items included in capital cannot exceed 100 of its tier 1 capital  under the riskbased guidelines to remain adequatelycapitalized financial institutions are required to maintain a total riskbased capital ratio of 8 with 4 being tier 1 riskbased capital the appropriate regulatory authority may set higher capital requirements when they believe an institutions circumstances warrant    11    table of contents under the leverage guidelines financial institutions are required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 3 the minimum ratio is applicable only to financial institutions that meet certain specified criteria including excellent asset quality high liquidity low interest rate risk exposure and the highest regulatory rating financial institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4  failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the financial institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities these include limitations on the ability to pay dividends the issuance by the regulatory authority of a directive to increase capital and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic in addition the financial institution could be subject to the measures described below under prompt corrective action as applicable to undercapitalized institutions  the riskbased capital standards of the federal reserve the occ and the fdic specify that evaluations by the banking agencies of a banks capital adequacy will include an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of a banks capital due to changes in interest rates these banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active oversight of risk management activities by senior management  fdicia requires federal banking regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements for these purposes fdicia establishes five capital tiers wellcapitalized adequatelycapitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized  throughout 2013 our regulatory capital ratios and those of the bank were in excess of the levels established for wellcapitalized institutions an institution is deemed to be wellcapitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of 10 or greater a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 6 or greater and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 5 or greater and is not subject to a regulatory order agreement or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure
