  risk governance  we use a multifaceted approach to risk governance it begins with the board of directors defining our risk appetite in aggregate as moderatetolow this does not preclude engagement in select higher risk activities rather the definition is intended to represent an average of where we want our overall risk to be managed  two board committees primarily oversee implementation of this desired risk profile the audit committee and the risk oversight committee            the audit committee is principally involved with overseeing the integrity of financial statements providing oversight of the internal audit department and selecting our external auditors our chief auditor reports directly to the audit committee chair            the risk oversight committee supervises our risk management processes which primarily cover credit market liquidity operational compliance legal strategic and reputational risks it also approves the charters of executive risk management committees sets risk limits on certain risk measures eg economic value of equity receives results of the risk selfassessment process and routinely engages management in review of key risks our credit review executive reports directly to the risk oversight committee  both committees are comprised of independent directors and routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and risk management on a periodic basis the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both such as the construct and appropriateness of the acl which is reviewed quarterly all directors have access to information provided to each committee and all scheduled meetings are open to all directors  further through its compensation committee the board of directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards is risksensitive and aligns the interests of management creditors and shareholders we utilize a variety of compensationrelated tools to induce appropriate behavior including common stock ownership thresholds for the chief executive officer and certain members of senior management a requirement to hold until retirement a portion of net shares received upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards 50 for executive officers and 25 for other award recipients equity deferrals recoupment provisions and the right to terminate compensation plans at any time  management has introduced a number of steps to help ensure an aggregate moderatetolow risk appetite is maintained foremost is a quarterly selfassessment process in which each business segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls the segment analyses are combined with assessments by our risk management organization of major risk sectors eg credit market operational reputational compliance etc to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment outcomes of the process include a determination of the quality of the overall control process the direction of risk and our position compared to the defined risk appetite  management also utilizes a wide series of metrics key risk indicators to monitor risk positions throughout the company in general a range for each metric is established which allows the company in aggregate to maintain its moderatetolow risk profile deviations from the range will indicate if the risk being measured is moving which may then necessitate corrective action  we also have four other executive level committees to manage risk alco credit policy and strategy risk management and capital management each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature we believe this structure helps ensure appropriate elevation of issues and overall communication of strategies    14    table of contents huntington utilizes three levels of defense with regard to risk management 1 business segments 2 corporate risk management and 3 internal audit and credit review to induce greater ownership of risk within its business segments segment risk officers have been embedded to identify and monitor risk elevate and remediate issues establish controls perform selftesting and oversee the quarterly selfassessment process segment risk officers report directly to the related segment manager with a dotted line to the chief risk officer corporate risk management establishes policies sets operating limits reviews new or modified productsprocesses ensures consistency and quality assurance within the segments and produces the enterprise risk assessment the chief risk officer has significant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans as they apply to risk internal audit and credit review provide additional assurance that riskrelated functions are operating as intended  risk overview  we like other financial companies are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations many of which are outside of our direct control though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns among the risks assumed are 1 credit risk which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms 2 market risk which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads 3 liquidity risk which is a the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external macro market issues investor and customer perception of financial strength and events unrelated to us such as war terrorism or financial institution market specific issues and b the risk of loss based on our ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments due to the mix and maturity structure of our balance sheet amount of onhand cash and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding 4 operational and legal risk which is the risk of loss due to human error inadequate or failed internal systems and controls violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters and security risks and 5 compliance risk which exposes us to money penalties enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws rules and regulations that apply to the financial services industry  we also expend considerable effort to contain risk which emanates from execution of our business strategies and work relentlessly to protect the companys reputation strategic risk and reputational risk do not easily lend themselves to traditional methods of measurement rather we closely monitor them through processes such as new product  initiative reviews frequent financial performance reviews employee and client surveys monitoring market intelligence periodic discussions between management and our board and other such efforts  in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report readers should carefully consider that the following important factors among others could negatively impact our business future results of operations and future cash flows materially  credit risks  1 our acl level may prove to be inappropriate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could materially adversely affect our net income and capital  our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers our acl of 7108 million at december 31 2013 represented managements estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we periodically review our acl for appropriateness in doing so we consider economic conditions and trends collateral values and credit quality indicators such as past chargeoff experience levels of past due loans and npas there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases if the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  in addition bank regulators periodically review our acl and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan chargeoffs any increase in our acl or loan chargeoffs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  2 weakness in economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business  our performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us our customers and our counterparties these conditions could result in one or more of the following            a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us      15    table of contents         a decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us and            an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us  an increase in the number of delinquencies bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of npas ncos provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale the markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and thus are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors  market risks  1 changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income reduce transactional income and negatively impact the value of our loans securities and other assets this could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows financial condition results of operations and capital  our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions conditions such as inflation deflation recession unemployment money supply and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates if our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment net interest income could be materially adversely impacted likewise if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment net interest income could be adversely impacted  changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans securities assets under management and other assets including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights an increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in npas and a reduction of income recognized which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows when we place a loan on nonaccrual status we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable which decreases interest income however we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding nals without any corresponding interest income in addition transactional income including trust income brokerage income and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from periodtoperiod based on a number of factors including the interest rate environment  rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixedrate debt securities and cash flow hedging derivatives portfolio any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts oci shareholders equity and the tangible common equity ratio any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios notably tier i and total riskbased capital ratios in a rising interest rate environment pension and other postretirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative oci impacts from securities and financial instruments  certain investment securities notably mortgagebacked securities are very sensitive to rising and falling rates generally when rates rise prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will increase conversely when rates fall prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will decrease in either case interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgagebacked securities investments  liquidity risks  1 if we lose access to capital markets we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors creditors and borrowers or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities  liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost the bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers the board of directors establishes liquidity policies and limits and management establishes operating guidelines for liquidity  wholesale funding sources include securitization federal funds purchased securities sold under repurchase agreements noncore deposits and medium and longterm debt the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank of cincinnati which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgagerelated assets we maintain a portfolio of highlyrated marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity    16    table of contents capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of the bank and corporation the inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations cash flows and level of regulatoryqualifying capital we may from timetotime consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions  2 due to the losses that the bank incurred in 2008 and 2009 prior to december 31 2013 the bank and its subsidiaries could not declare and pay dividends to the holding company any subsidiary of the holding company outside the banks consolidated group or any security holder outside the banks consolidated group without regulatory approval also the bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits  dividends from the bank to the parent company are the primary source of funds for the payment of dividends to our shareholders under applicable statutes and regulations a national bank may not declare and pay dividends in any year greater than its undivided profits or in excess of an amount equal to the sum of the total of the net income of the bank for that year and the retained net income of the bank for the preceding two years minus the sum of any transfers required by the occ and any transfers required to be made to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock unless the occ approves the declaration and payment of dividends in excess of such amount the banks undivided profits were in a deficit position until december 2013 we anticipate that the bank will declare dividends to the holding company during the first half of 2014  operational and legal risks  1 the resolution of significant pending litigation if unfavorable could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period  we face legal risks in our businesses and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters if unfavorable may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period  note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements updates the status of litigation concerning cyberco holdings inc although the bank maintains litigation reserves related to this case the ultimate resolution of the matter if unfavorable may be material to our results of operations for a particular reporting period  2 we face significant operational risks which could lead to expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and capital markets  we are exposed to many types of operational risks including cyberattack risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders unauthorized transactions by employees or outsiders or operational errors by employees including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems these operational risks could lead to expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and the capital markets  moreover negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including lending practices corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action  relative to acquisitions we cannot predict if or when we will be able to identify and attract acquisition candidates or make acquisitions on favorable terms we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of acquired institutions in a timely and efficient manner and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies  huntington is under continuous threat of loss due to cyberattacks especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business the most significant cyberattack risks that we face are efraud denial of service and loss of sensitive customer data loss from efraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from customer or our accounts loss can occur as a result of negative customer experience in the event of a successful denial of service attack that disrupts availability of our online banking services the attempts to breach sensitive customer data such as account numbers and social security numbers could present significant reputational legal andor regulatory costs to us if successful our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers our plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers    17    table of contents 3 failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and stock price  effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud as a financial holding company we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures such controls and procedures are modified supplemented and changed from timetotime as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments any failure to maintain in the future an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis which could result in regulatory actions loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our business and stock price  compliance risks  1 bank regulators and other regulations including basel iii capital standards and ccar may require higher capital levels impacting our ability to pay common stock dividends or repurchase our common stock  on july 2 2013 the federal reserve voted to adopt final basel iii capital rules for us banking organizations the final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the united states the basel iii regulatory capital reforms from the basel committee on banking supervision and certain changes required by the doddfrank act under the final rule minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations as a standardized approach institution the basel iii minimum capital requirements will become effective for us on january 1 2015 and will be fully phasedin on january 1 2019  the federal reserve has issued guidelines for evaluating proposals by certain bank holding companies including us to undertake capital actions such as increasing dividend payments or repurchasing or redeeming stock this process is known as ccar ccar includes a quantitative examination component in which bhcspecific data is run through models developed by the federal reserve with the intention of estimating capital levels in a hypothetical severely adverse economic scenario capital plans for 2014 were required to be submitted by january 6 2014 the federal reserve will either object to a capital plan in whole or in part or provide a notice of nonobjection no later than march 31 2014 for plans submitted by the january 6 2014 submission date we submitted our capital plan to the federal reserve on january 5 2014  the federal reserve and occ are expected to undertake these capital plan reviews on a regular basis in the future there can be no assurance that the federal reserve or occ will respond favorably to our capital plan as part of their future capital plan reviews and the federal reserve occ or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including common stock dividends and stock repurchases although not currently anticipated our regulators may require us to raise additional capital in the future issuing additional common stock may dilute existing stockholders  2 if our regulators deem it appropriate they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our ability to compete for new business constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends and increase the cost of our services  we are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators including the occ federal reserve fdic sec cfpb financial industry regulatory authority and various state regulatory agencies as such we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations many of which are discussed in the regulatory matters section as part of their supervisory process which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways including monetary fines impacting our ability to pay dividends precluding mergers or acquisitions limiting our ability to offer certain products or services or imposing additional capital requirements  with the development of the cfpb our consumer products and services are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations we may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations enforcement actions and litigation in the future related to consumer practices thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions in addition increased regulatory inquiries and investigations as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments could result in significant loss of revenue limit the products or services we offer require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products impose additional compliance costs on us cause harm to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses    18    table of contents 3 legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs adding complexity in doing business impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets requiring us to increase our regulatory capital limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities and otherwise result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operation liquidity or stock price  the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states establishes the cfpb and requires the bureau and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations at this time it is difficult to predict the extent to which the doddfrank act or the resulting rules and regulations in their entirety will impact our business compliance with these new laws and regulations will result in additional costs which could be significant and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations in addition if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to our consumer operations we may be subject to fines penalties or judgments or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses which could adversely affect operations and in turn financial results
