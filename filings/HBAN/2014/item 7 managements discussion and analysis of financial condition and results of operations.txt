executive overview  2013 financial performance review  in 2013 we reported net income of 6387 million or 072 per common share relatively unchanged from the prior year this resulted in a 113 return on average assets and a 127 return on average tangible common equity in addition we grew our base of consumer and business customers while our efficiency ratio decreased to 629 in 2013 from 634 in 2012 results from our strategic business investments and ocr sales approach continued in 2013 also see significant items influencing financial performance comparisons within the discussion of results of operations  fullytaxable equivalent net interest income was 17 billion in 2013 an increase of 10 million or less than 1 compared with 2012 this reflected the impact of 4 loan growth offset by a 5 basis point decline in the net interest margin to 336 as well as a 7 reduction in other earning assets the majority of which were loans held for sale the loan growth reflected an increase in average campi loans due to continued growth within the middle market healthcare vertical equipment finance and dealer floorplan loans also our average automobile loans increased as the growth in originations remained strong and we kept these loans on our balance sheet instead of selling them through securitizations as expected our cre portfolio declined reflecting continued runoff as acceptable returns for new originations were balanced against internal concentration limits and increased competition for projects sponsored by high quality developers average loans heldforsale decreased reflecting the impact of automobile securitizations completed in 2012 and no such securitizations in 2013    24    table of contents noninterest income was 10 billion in 2013 a 9 decrease compared with 2012 mortgage banking income was down 642 million due to a reduction in volume lower gain on sale margin and a higher percentage of originations held on the balance sheet in addition gains on sale of loans were down 400 million due to no auto securitizations in 2013 service charges increased 96 million in 2013 despite a decrease of approximately 28 million due to a change that we made in february 2013 on posting order for our consumer transaction accounts  noninterest expense was 18 billion in 2013 a 4 decrease compared with 2012 the decrease was primarily due to lower marketing deposit and other insurance professional services and other expense as we actively managed the pace and size of investment other expense declined due to lower mortgage repurchase and warranty and oreo and foreclosure expenses this was partially offset by franchise repositioning expense related significant items included in net occupancy 121 million personnel costs 67 million equipment 24 million outside data processing and other services 14 million and other expense 10 million the increase in personnel costs primarily related to the increase in the number of average fulltime equivalent employees was partially offset by a significant item of 339 million from the pension curtailment gain  most credit quality related metrics in 2013 reflected continued improvement nals declined 856 million or 21 from 2012 to 3221 million or 075 of total loans and leases npas declined 936 million or 21 compared to a yearago to 3522 million or 082 of total loans and leases oreo and other npas the decreases primarily reflected meaningful improvement in both cre and campi nals the provision for credit losses decreased 573 million or 39 from 2012 due to the continued decline in classified criticized and nonaccrual loans and included the implementation of enhancements to our alll model ncos decreased 1538 million or 45 from the prior year to 1887 million ncos were an annualized 045 of average loans and leases in the current year compared to 085 in 2012 within the consumer portfolio ncos related to chapter 7 bankruptcy loans amounted to 228 million in 2013 and 346 million in 2012 the acl as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 165 from 199 a year ago while the acl as a percentage of periodend total nals increased to 221 from 199  the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio at december 31 2013 was 883 up 7 basis points from a year ago our tier 1 common riskbased capital ratio at year end was 1090 up from 1048 at the end of 2012 the regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital ratio at december 31 2013 was 1228 up from 1202 at december 31 2012 the increase in the regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital ratio reflected the increase in retained earnings partially offset by the redemption of 50 million of qualifying reit preferred securities in the 2013 fourth quarter and growth in riskweighted assets all capital ratios were impacted by the repurchase of 17 million common shares over the last four quarters none of which were repurchased during the 2013 fourth quarter we have the ability to repurchase up to 136 million additional shares of common stock through the first quarter of 2014 we intend to continue disciplined repurchase activity consistent with our annual capital plan our capital return objectives and market conditions  business overview  general  our general business objectives are 1 grow net interest income and fee income 2 increase crosssell and shareofwallet across all business segments 3 improve efficiency ratio 4 continue to strengthen risk management including sustained improvements in credit metrics and 5 maintain strong capital and liquidity positions  in 2013 we grew our base of consumer and business customers while achieving positive operating leverage our performance in the second half of 2013 demonstrates strong business momentum positioning us well for 2014 highlights of our financial strength in 2013 include a strong balance sheet ongoing deposit growth and quality loan growth in commercial and auto lending our deposit and lending growth is the result of focused execution and key strategic investments made over the last four years we have done all of this while decreasing expenses by 4 percent year over year as the result of disciplined expense management  we continue to face strong competition from other banks and financial service firms in our markets to address these challenges the cornerstone of our strategy has been to invest in the franchise in order to grow our market share and shareofwallet in this regard our ocr methodology continued to deliver success in 2013 consumer checking account households grew by 96 thousand households or 8 over the last year commercial relationships grew at a rate of 6 and have increased by 9 thousand commercial customers since 2012 our fair play philosophy combined with continued ocr success positively impacted results in 2013  economy  the environment in 2013 was different than we thought it would be when we started the year as the economic interest rate and political environments were more challenging currently we are seeing good momentum going into 2014 as customers seem to have a slightly better mindset as the political environment seems to be less of an issue and the general economic outlook is more positive as evidenced by the following            although slower than the national growth rate of 174 aggregate employment growth in our footprint states remained positive at 089 over the 12 month period ended october 2013      25    table of contents         according to the philadelphia frb coincident economic activity index michigan indiana and ohio outperformed the nation in the economic recovery to date and prospects for growth over the next six months appear positive            industrial vacancy rates have shown declining trends in our large footprint msas            consistent with longterm trends housing prices have been rising broadly across our footprint over 2013 and have tended to be more stable than the national average  legislative and regulatory  a comprehensive discussion of legislative and regulatory matters affecting us can be found in the regulatory matters section included in item 1 of this form 10k  2014 expectations  net interest income is expected to moderately increase we anticipate an increase in earning assets as total loans moderately grow and investment securities remain near current levels however those benefits to net interest income are expected to be mostly offset by continued downward pressure on nim while we are maintaining a disciplined approach to loan pricing asset yields remain under pressure but the continued opportunity of deposit repricing remains albeit closer to current levels  the campi portfolio is expected to grow consistent with the anticipated increase in customer activity our campi loan pipeline remains robust with much of this reflecting the positive impact from our investments in specialized commercial verticals automotive dealer relationships focused ocr sales process and continued support of middle market and small business lending automobile loan originations remain strong and we currently do not anticipate any automobile securitizations in the near future residential mortgages home equity and cre loan balances are expected to increase modestly  we anticipate the increase in total loans will modestly outpace growth in total deposits this reflects our continued focus on the overall cost of funds through the issuance of longterm debt as well as the continued shift towards low and nocost demand deposits and money market deposit accounts  noninterest income excluding the impact of any net msr activity is expected to be slightly lower than recent levels due to the anticipated decline in mortgage banking revenues and the continued refinement of products under our fair play philosophy  noninterest expense excluding the net 10 million of benefit from significant items we experienced in 2013 is expected to remain around current levels we are committed to delivering positive operating leverage for the 2014 full year  npas are expected to show continued improvement this year ncos represented the midpoint of our expected normalized range of 35 to 55 basis points the level of provision for credit losses was below our longterm expectation and we continue to expect moderate quarterly volatility  the effective tax rate for 2014 is expected to be in the range of 25 to 28 primarily reflecting the impacts of taxexempt income taxadvantaged investments and general business credits    26    table of contents table 2selected annual income statements 1                                       year ended december 31

contents discussion of results of operations  this section provides a review of financial performance from a consolidated perspective it also includes a significant items section that summarizes key issues important for a complete understanding of performance trends key consolidated balance sheet and income statement trends are discussed all earnings per share data is reported on a diluted basis for additional insight on financial performance please read this section in conjunction with the business segment discussion  significant items  definition of significant items  from timetotime revenue expenses or taxes are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities and  or by items that while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or shortterm in nature we refer to such items as significant items most often these significant items result from factors originating outside the company eg regulatory actions  assessments windfall gains changes in accounting principles onetime tax assessments  refunds litigation actions etc in other cases they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of business eg merger  restructuring charges recapitalization actions goodwill impairment etc  even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions as a general rule volatility alone does not define a significant item for example changes in the provision for credit losses gains  losses from investment activities asset valuation writedowns etc reflect ordinary banking activities and are therefore typically excluded from consideration as a significant item  we believe the disclosure of significant items provides a better understanding of our performance and trends to ascertain which of such items if any to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance ie within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations as well as how if at all to adjust estimates of future performance accordingly to this end we adopted a practice of listing significant items in our external disclosure documents eg earnings press releases investor presentations forms 10q and 10k  significant items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance  significant items

is net interest income which is the difference between interest income from earning assets primarily loans securities and direct financing leases and interest expense of funding sources primarily interestbearing deposits and borrowings earning asset balances and related funding sources as well as changes in the levels of interest rates impact net interest income the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interestbearing liabilities is the net interest spread noninterestbearing sources of funds such as demand deposits and shareholders equity also support earning assets the impact of the noninterestbearing sources of funds often referred to as free funds is captured in the net interest margin which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a fullytaxable equivalent basis which means that taxfree interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income assuming a 35 tax rate    29    table of contents the following table shows changes in fullytaxable equivalent interest income interest expense and net interest income due to

versus 2012  the provision for income taxes was 2158 million for 2013 compared with a provision for income taxes of 1841 million in 2012 both years included the benefits from taxexempt income taxadvantaged investments and general business credits in 2013 a 60 million reduction in the 2013 provision for state income taxes net of federal was recorded for the portion of state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards that are more likely than not to be realized compared to a 213 million reduction in 2012 at december 31 2013 we had a net federal and state deferred tax asset of 1376 million based on both positive and negative evidence and our level of forecasted future taxable income we determined no impairment existed to the net federal and state deferred tax asset at december 31 2013 for regulatory capital purposes there was no disallowed net deferred tax asset at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012  we file income tax returns with the irs and various state city and foreign jurisdictions federal income tax audits have been completed for tax years through 2009 in the first quarter of 2013 the irs began an examination of our 2010 and 2011 consolidated federal income tax returns we have appealed certain proposed adjustments resulting from the irs examination of our 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 tax returns we believe the tax positions taken related to such proposed adjustments are correct and supported by applicable statutes regulations and judicial authority and intend to vigorously defend them it is possible the ultimate resolution of the proposed adjustments if unfavorable may be material to the results of operations in the period it occurs nevertheless although no assurances can be given we believe the resolution of these examinations will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position various state and other jurisdictions remain open to examination including kentucky indiana michigan pennsylvania west virginia and illinois  on september 13 2013 the irs released final tangible property regulations under sections 162a and 263a of the irc and proposed regulations under section 168 of the irc these regulations generally apply to taxable years beginning on or after january 1 2014 and will affect all taxpayers that acquire produce or improve tangible property based upon preliminary analysis we do not expect that the adoption of these regulations will have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements  2012 versus 2011  the provision for income taxes was 1841 million for 2012 compared with a provision of 1646 million in 2011 both years included the benefits from taxexempt income taxadvantaged investments and

governance section included in item 1a and the regulatory matters section of item 1 of this form 10k  some of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit market liquidity operational and compliance risks are described in the following paragraphs    37    table of contents credit risk  credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending we also have credit risk associated with our afs and htm securities portfolio see note 4 and note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management mortgage banking and trading activities while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity we believe this exposure is minimal  we continue to focus on the identification monitoring and managing of our credit risk in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes market risk management activities and portfolio diversification we use additional quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources enhanced use of modeling technology and internal stress testing processes our portfolio management resources demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile in our efforts to continue to identify risk mitigation techniques we have focused on product design features origination policies and treatment strategies for delinquent or stressed borrowers  the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers all authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type geography industry and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives although we offer a broad set of products we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk portfolio profile  the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution for example we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage position to that end we continue to expand resources in our risk management areas  although credit quality improved significantly in 2013 there remained a degree of economic stress that continued to negatively impact us and the financial services industry as a whole we continued to experience higher than historical levels of delinquencies and ncos in our residential secured consumer loan portfolios the performance metrics associated with the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios continued to be the most significantly impacted portfolios as real estate prices remain lower than pre2008 levels and the unemployment rate remains high  loan and lease credit exposure mix  at december 31 2013 our loans and leases totaled 431 billion representing a 24 billion or 6 increase compared to 407 billion at december 31 2012 the majority of the portfolio growth occurred in the automobile portfolio with campi and residential showing modest growth huntington remained committed to the high quality origination strategy in the automobile portfolio the cre portfolio declined as a result of continued runoff as acceptable returns for new originations were balanced against internal concentration limits and increased competition for projects sponsored by high quality developers  total commercial loans were 224 billion at december 31 2013 and represented 52 of our total loan and lease credit exposure our commercial loan portfolio is diversified along product type customer size and geography within our footprint and is comprised of the following see commercial credit discussion  campi  campi loans and leases are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs equipment purchases or other projects the majority of these borrowers are customers doing business within our geographic regions campi loans and leases are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company andor the personal guarantee of the business owners the financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a campi loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral this treatment is a result of the credit decision process which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt the operation sale rental or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans as we have expanded our campi portfolio we have developed a series of verticals to ensure that new products or lending types are embedded within a structured centralized commercial lending area with designated experienced credit officers    38    table of contents cre  cre loans consist of loans to developers and reits supporting incomeproducing or forsale commercial real estate properties we mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement these loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings office and industrial buildings and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation sale or refinance of the property  construction cre

financing of the property our construction cre portfolio primarily consists of retail multi family office and warehouse project types generally these loans are for construction projects that have been presold or preleased or have secured permanent financing as well as loans to real estate companies with significant equity invested in each project these loans are underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate lending group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule  total consumer loans and

borrowers management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process we utilize a centralized preview and senior loan approval committee led by our chief credit officer the risk rating see next paragraph and complexity of the credit determines the threshold for approval of the senior loan committee with a minimum credit exposure of 100 million for loans not requiring senior loan committee approval with the exception of small business loans credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority for small business loans we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures in this centralized decision environment certain individuals who understand each local region may make creditextension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities we operate in in addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval process  in commercial lending ongoing credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan we monitor all significant exposures on an ongoing basis all commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrowers pd and lgd this twodimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process the pd is rated and applied at the borrower level the lgd is rated and applied based on the specific type of credit extension and the quality and lien position associated with the underlying collateral the internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each periodic    40    table of contents  monitoring event there is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an ongoing basis we continually review and adjust our riskrating criteria based on actual experience which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate allowance for credit losses acl amount for the commercial portfolio a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio including small business loans to provide consistent oversight  in addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and  or risk of new loan originations this group is part of our risk management area and conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of credit processes  our standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment one of which is guarantor support on an annual basis or more frequently if warranted we consider among other things the guarantors reputation and creditworthiness along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth assuming such information is available our assessment of the guarantors credit strength or lack thereof is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans which is directly tied to and an integral component of our acl methodology when a loan goes to impaired status viable guarantor support is considered in the determination of a credit loss  if our assessment of the guarantors credit strength yields an inherent capacity to perform we will seek repayment from the guarantor as part of the collection process and have done so successfully however we do not formally track the repayment success from guarantors  substantially all loans categorized as classified see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements are managed by our special assets department sad the sad group is a specialized group of credit professionals that handle the daytoday management of workouts commercial recoveries and problem loan sales its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans assessing risk ratings and determining the appropriateness of the allowance the accrual status and the ultimate collectability of the classified loan portfolio  campi portfolio  the campi portfolio is comprised of loans to businesses where the source of repayment is associated with the ongoing operations of the business generally the loans are secured with the financing of the borrowers assets such as equipment accounts receivable andor inventory in many cases the loans are secured by real estate although the operation sale or refinancing of the real estate is not a primary source of repayment for the loan for loans secured by real estate appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements  there were no commercial loan segments considered an industry or geographic concentration of lending currently higherrisk segments of the campi portfolio include loans to borrowers supporting the home building industry contractors and leveraged lending we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio through origination policies a defined loan concentration policy with established limits ongoing loan level reviews and portfolio level reviews recourse requirements and continuous portfolio risk management activities our origination policies for this portfolio include loan producttype specific policies such as ltv and debt service coverage ratios as applicable  the campi portfolio continues to have strong origination activity as evidenced by the growth over the past 12 months the credit quality of the portfolio continues to improve as we maintain focus on high quality originations problem loans have trended downward reflecting a combination of proactive risk identification and effective workout strategies implemented by the sad we continue to maintain a proactive approach to identifying borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty in order to maximize the potential solutions  cre portfolio  we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio specific to cre lending focusing on the quality of the developer and the specifics associated with each project generally we 1 limit our loans to 80 of the appraised value of the commercial real estate at origination 2 require net operating cash flows to be 125 of required interest and principal payments and 3 if the commercial real estate is nonowner occupied require that at least 50 of the space of the project be preleased we actively monitor both geographic and projecttype concentrations and performance metrics of all cre loan types with a focus on loans identified as higher risk based on the risk rating methodology both macrolevel and loanlevel stresstest scenarios based on existing and forecast market conditions are part of the ongoing portfolio management process for the cre portfolio    41    table of contents dedicated real estate professionals originated the majority of the portfolio with the remainder obtained from prior bank acquisitions appraisals are obtained from approved vendors and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process the portfolio is diversified by project type and loan size and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio subsequent to the origination of the loan the credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting andor risk of new loan originations  appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals and on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements we continue to perform ongoing portfolio level reviews within the cre portfolio these reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the projects being reviewed property values are updated using appraisals on a regular basis to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the ongoing management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions this highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers as well as an indepth knowledge of cre project lending and the market environment  consumer credit  consumer credit approvals are based on among other factors the financial strength and payment history of the borrower type of exposure and the transaction structure consumer credit decisions are generally made in a centralized environment utilizing decision models importantly certain individuals who understand each local region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our focus on the local communities we operate in each credit extension is assigned a specific pd and lgd the pd is generally based on the borrowers most recent credit bureau score fico which we update quarterly while the lgd is related to the type of collateral and the ltv ratio associated with the credit extension  in consumer lending credit risk is managed from a segment ie loan type collateral position geography etc and vintage performance analysis all portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators we make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio which may result in changes to future origination strategies the ongoing analysis and review process results in a determination of an appropriate alll amount for our consumer loan portfolio the independent risk management group has a consumer process review component to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes  collection action is initiated as needed through a centrally managed collection and recovery function the collection group employs a series of collection methodologies designed to maintain a high level of effectiveness while maximizing efficiency in addition to the consumer loan portfolio the collection group is responsible for collection activity on all sold and securitized consumer loans and leases collection practices include a single contact point for the majority of the residential real estate secured portfolios  during a 2013 review of our consumer portfolios we identified additional loans associated with borrowers who had filed chapter 7 bankruptcy and had not reaffirmed their debt thus meeting the definition of collateral dependent per occ regulatory guidance these loans were not identified in the 2012 third quarter implementation of the occs regulatory guidance the bankruptcy courts discharge of the borrowers debt is considered a concession when the discharged debt is not reaffirmed and as such the loan is placed on nonaccrual status and written down to collateral value less anticipated selling costs as a result of the review of our existing consumer portfolios additional ncos of 228 million were recorded in 2013 the majority of the nco impact was in the home equity portfolio and relates to juniorlien loans that meet the regulatory guidance  automobile portfolio  our strategy in the automobile portfolio continued to focus on high quality borrowers as measured by both fico and internal custom scores combined with appropriate ltvs terms and profitability our strategy and operational capabilities allow us to appropriately manage the origination quality across the entire portfolio including our newer markets although increased origination volume and entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels we believe our disciplined strategy and operational processes significantly mitigate these risks  we have continued to consistently execute our value proposition and take advantage of available market opportunities importantly we have maintained our high credit quality standard while expanding the portfolio we have developed and implemented a successful loan securitization strategy to ensure we remain within our established portfolio concentration limits    42    table of contents residential real estate secured portfolios  the properties securing our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are primarily located within our geographic footprint while home prices have clearly rebounded from the 20092010 levels they remain below the peak causing the performance in these portfolios to remain weaker than historical levels the residentialsecured portfolio originations continue to be of high quality with the majority of the negative credit impact coming from loans originated in 2006 and earlier we continue to evaluate all of our policies and processes associated with managing these portfolios our portfolio management strategies associated with our home savers group are consolidated in one

with underwriting criteria based on minimum credit scores debttoincome ratios and ltv ratios we offer closedend home equity loans which are generally fixedrate with principal and interest payments and variablerate interestonly home equity linesofcredit which do not require payment of principal during the 10year revolving period of the lineofcredit applications are underwritten centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system  given the low interest rate environment over the past several years many borrowers have utilized the lineofcredit home equity product as the primary source of financing their home versus residential mortgages the proportion of the home equity portfolio secured by a firstlien has increased significantly over the past three years positively impacting the portfolios risk profile at december 31 2013 48 billion or 58 of our total home equity portfolio was secured by firstlien mortgages compared to 52 in the prior year the firstlien position combined with continued high average fico scores significantly reduces the credit risk associated with these loans  we focus on high quality borrowers primarily located within our footprint further we actively manage the extension of credit and the amount of credit extended through a combination of criteria including financial position debttoincome policies and ltv policy limits the combination of high quality borrowers as measured by financial condition and fico score as well as the concentration of firstlien position loans provides a high degree of confidence regarding the performance of the 20092013 originations because we focus on developing complete relationships with our customers many of our home equity borrowers utilize other products and services also the majority of our home equity lineofcredit borrowers consistently pay in excess of the required minimum payment each month  we believe we have underwritten credit conservatively within this portfolio however home price volatility has decreased the value of the collateral for this portfolio and has caused a portion of the portfolio to have an ltv greater than 100 these higher ltv ratios are directly correlated with borrower payment patterns and are a focus of our home saver group    43    table of contents real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended and in the event of default subsequent changes in these values impact the severity of losses we obtain a property valuation for every loan or lineofcredit as part of the origination process and the valuation is reviewed by a real estate professional in conjunction with the credit underwriting process the type of property valuation obtained is based on credit parameters and a majority of these valuations are based on complete walkthrough appraisals we believe an avm estimate with a signed property inspection is an appropriate valuation source for a portion of our home equity lending activities this valuation policy along with our other credit policies are reevaluated on an ongoing basis with the intent of ensuring complete independence in the requesting and reviewing of real estate valuations associated with loan decisions we update values as appropriate and in compliance with applicable regulations particularly for loans identified as higher risk loans are identified as higher risk based on performance indicators and the updated values are utilized to facilitate our portfolio management processes as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions  we continue to make origination policy adjustments based on our assessment of an appropriate risk profile and industry actions in addition to origination policy adjustments we take actions as necessary to manage the risk profile of this portfolio we believe our credit risk management systems allow for effective portfolio analysis and segmentation to identify the highest risk exposures in the portfolio our disclosures regarding lien position and fico distribution are examples of segmentation analysis   although the collateral value assessment is an important component of the overall credit risk analysis there are very few instances of available equity in juniorlien default situations further effective in 2012 any juniorlien loan associated with a nonaccruing firstlien loan is also placed on nonaccrual status  within the home equity lineofcredit portfolio the standard product is a 10year interestonly draw period with a 20year fully amortizing term at the end of the draw period prior to 2007 the standard product was a 10year draw period with a balloon payment while subsequent originations convert to a 20year amortizing loan structure after the 10year draw period the borrower must reapply to extend the existing structure or begin repaying the debt in a traditional term structure  the principal and interest payment associated with the term structure will be higher than the interestonly payment resulting in maturity risk our maturity risk can be segregated into two distinct segments 1 home equity linesofcredit underwritten with a balloon payment at maturity and 2 home equity linesofcredit with an automatic conversion to a 20year amortizing loan we manage this risk based on both the actual maturity date of the lineofcredit structure and at the end of the 10year draw period this maturity risk is embedded in the portfolio which we address with proactive contact strategies beginning one year prior to maturity in certain circumstances our home saver group is able to provide payment and structure relief to borrowers experiencing significant financial hardship associated with the payment adjustment  the table below summarizes our home equity lineofcredit portfolio by maturity date

                    the amounts in the above table maturing in four years or less primarily consist of balloon payment structures and represent the most significant maturity risk the amounts maturing in more than four years primarily consist of exposure with a 20year amortization period after the 10year draw period  historically less than 30 of our home equity linesofcredit that are one year or less from maturity actually reach the maturity date and we anticipate this percentage will decline in future periods as our proactive approach to managing maturity risk continues to evolve  residential mortgages portfolio  we focus on higher quality borrowers and underwrite all applications centrally we do not originate residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options we have incorporated regulatory requirements and guidance into our underwriting process and will continue to evaluate the impact of the qm requirements impact on the industry    44    table of contents all residential mortgages are originated based on a completed full appraisal during the credit underwriting process we update values on a regular basis in compliance with applicable regulations to facilitate our portfolio management as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions  generally our practice is to sell a significant portion of our fixedrate originations in the secondary market as such at december 31 2013 46 of our total residential mortgage portfolio were arms these arms primarily consist of a fixedrate of interest for the first 3 to 5 years and then adjust annually at december 31 2013 arm loans that were expected to have rates reset through 2016 totaled 15 billion these loans scheduled to reset are primarily associated with loans originated subsequent to 2007 and as such are not subject to the most significant declines in underlying property value given the quality of our borrowers the relatively low current interest rates and the results of our continued analysis including possible impacts of changes in interest rates we believe that we have a relatively limited exposure to arm reset risk nonetheless we have taken actions to mitigate our risk exposure we initiate borrower contact at least six months prior to the interest rate resetting and have been successful in converting many arms to fixedrate loans through this process given the relatively low current interest rates many fixedrate products currently offer a better interest rate to our arm borrowers we are subject to repurchase risk associated with residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market an appropriate level of reserve for representations and warranties related to residential mortgage loans sold has been established to address this repurchase risk inherent in the portfolio see operational risk discussion  several government programs continued to impact the residential mortgage portfolio including various refinance programs such as hamp and harp which positively affected the availability of credit for the industry during the year ended december 31 2013 we closed 600 million in harp residential mortgages and 60 million in hamp residential mortgages the harp residential mortgage loans are considered current and are either part of our residential mortgage portfolio or serviced for others the hamp refinancings are associated with residential mortgages that are serviced for others  credit quality  this section should be read in conjunction with note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of credit quality performance ratios this approach forms the basis of most of the discussion in the sections immediately following npas and nals tdrs acl and ncos in addition we utilize delinquency rates risk distribution and migration patterns and product segmentation in the analysis of our credit quality performance  our overall credit quality performance returned to normalized prerecession levels nals declined 21 to 3221 million compared to december 31 2012 as both the campi and cre portfolio segments showed declines ncos decreased 45 compared to the prior year as a result of significant declines in the campi and cre portfolios combined with significant recovery activity and net reductions in the residential and home equity portfolios the home equity portfolio in particular was significantly impacted by the implementation of chapter 7 bankruptcy regulatory accounting guidance with an additional impact in 2013 commercial classified loans declined reflecting the continued improvement across the portfolio the acl to total loans ratio declined to 165 but our coverage ratios as demonstrated by the acl to nal ratio of 221 remained strong  npas nals and tdrs  this section should be read in conjunction with note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial

concessions subsequent to the initial tdr terms however there are times when subsequent modifications are required such as when the modified loan matures often the loans are performing in accordance with the tdr terms and a new note is originated with similar modified terms these loans are subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing if the loan is not performing in accordance with the existing tdr terms typically an individualized approach to repayment is established in accordance with asc 3102035 the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan a new loan is considered for removal from the tdr designation a continuation of the prior note requires the continuation of the tdr designation and because the refinanced note constitutes a new or amended debt instrument it is included in our tdr activity table below as a new tdr and a restructured tdr removal during the period  the types of concessions granted are consistent with those granted on new tdrs and include interest rate reductions amortization or maturity date changes beyond what the collateral supports and principal forgiveness based on the borrowers specific needs at a point in time our policy does not limit the number of times a loan may be modified a loan may be modified multiple times if it is considered to be in the best interest of both the borrower and us  loans are not automatically considered to be accruing tdrs upon the granting of a new concession if the loan is in accruing status and no loss is expected based on the modified terms the modified tdr remains in accruing status for loans that are on nonaccrual status before the modification collection of both principal and interest must not be in doubt and the borrower must be able to exhibit sufficient cash flows for a sixmonth period of time to service the debt in order to return to accruing status this sixmonth period could extend before or after the restructure date  tdrs in the home equity and residential mortgage portfolio will continue to increase for a time as we continue to appropriately manage the portfolio any granted change in terms or conditions that are not readily available in the market for that borrower requires the designation as a tdr  the following table reflects tdr

components both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the alll and the aulc combined these reserves comprise the total acl our credit administration group is responsible for developing the methodology assumptions and estimates used in the calculation as well as determining the appropriateness of the acl the alll represents the estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reported date additions to the alll result from recording provision expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting from loan riskrating downgrades while reductions reflect chargeoffs net of recoveries decreased risk levels resulting from loan riskrating upgrades or the sale of loans the aulc is determined by applying the transaction reserve process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures multiplied by an applicable funding expectation  a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the acl to the level we have determined to be appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the provision for credit losses in 2013 was 900 million compared with 1474 million in 2012  we regularly evaluate the appropriateness of the acl by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above we also consider the impact of collateral value trends and portfolio diversification  in 2013 we implemented an enhanced commercial risk rating system and acl calculation process in addition we enhanced some of our qualitative assessments specifically around the impact of the prevailing economic conditions these enhancements had an immaterial impact on the overall credit reserve and the overall decline in the acl was primarily due to an improvement in underlying credit quality across the portfolio the portfolio level changes are more fully described below  our acl evaluation process includes the ongoing assessment of credit quality metrics and a comparison of certain acl benchmarks to current performance while the total acl balance has declined in recent quarters all of the relevant benchmarks remain strong  the following table reflects

2012 primarily due to the enhancements to the risk rating system and assumptions regarding the unfunded portion of loan commitments the cre acl decreased 1228 million compared with december 31 2012 due to the impact of incorporating the current collateral value in the calculation of the expected loss in addition to a property type analysis this provides a more specific assessment of the potential loss given default the current portfolio management practices focus on increasing borrower equity in the projects and recent underwriting includes meaningfully lower ltv the december 31 2013 cre acl covers nals by more than two times and represents 13 quarters of the average 4 quarter chargeoff level the decrease associated with the auto portfolio is based on the continued positive performance metrics and the high quality origination strategy the home equity alll increased slightly as the juniorlien lien component remains the riskiest portion of the portfolio the residential mortgage portfolio alll declined consistent with the improving credit quality metrics the alll for the other consumer portfolio is consistent with expectations given the increasing level of overdraft exposure the reduction in the acl compared with december 31 2012 is primarily a function of the decline in the cre portfolio  compared with december 31 2012 the aulc increased 222 million primarily reflecting the impact of an enhanced assessment of the unfunded commercial exposure  the acl to total loans declined to 165 at december 31 2013 compared to 199 at december 31 2012 we believe the decline in the ratio is appropriate given the continued improvement in the risk profile of our loan portfolio further we believe that early identification of loans with changes in credit metrics and aggressive action plans for these loans combined with originating high quality new loans will contribute to continued improvement in our key credit quality metrics  we have significant exposure to loans secured by residential real estate and continue to be an active lender in our communities the impact of the downturn in real estate values over the past several years has had a significant impact on some of our borrowers as evidenced by the higher delinquencies and ncos since late 2007 recently real estate values have begun to slowly rise from their 2007 levels in our primary markets  given the combination of these noted positive and negative factors we believe that our acl is appropriate and its coverage level is reflective of the quality of our portfolio and the current operating environment  ncos  any loan in any portfolio may be chargedoff prior to the policies described below if a loss confirming event has occurred loss confirming events include but are not limited to bankruptcy unsecured continued delinquency foreclosure or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency and that asset is the sole source of repayment additionally discharged collateral dependent nonreaffirmed debt in chapter 7 bankruptcy filings will result in a chargeoff to estimated collateral value less anticipated selling costs at the time of the modification  campi

            in assessing nco trends it is helpful to understand the process of how commercial loans are treated as they deteriorate over time the alll established is consistent with the level of risk associated with the original underwriting as a part of our normal portfolio management process for commercial loans the loan is periodically reviewed and the alll is increased or decreased based on the updated risk rating in certain cases the standard alll is determined to not be appropriate and a specific reserve is established based on the projected cash flow or collateral value of the specific loan chargeoffs if necessary are generally recognized in a period after the specific alll was established if the previously established alll exceeds that necessary to satisfactorily resolve the problem loan a reduction in the overall level of the alll could be recognized consumer loans are treated in much the same manner as commercial loans with increasing reserve factors applied based on the risk characteristics of the loan although specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans in summary if loan quality deteriorates the typical credit sequence would be periods of reserve building followed by periods of higher ncos as the previously established alll is utilized additionally an increase in the alll either precedes or is in conjunction with increases in nals when a loan is classified as nal it is evaluated for specific alll or chargeoff as a result an increase in nals does not necessarily result in an increase in the alll or an expectation of higher future ncos  our overall ncos are returning to prerecession levels however we anticipate nco levels for both the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios will remain at elevated levels in the near future the home equity portfolio will continue to be impacted by borrowers that are seeking to refinance but are in a negative equity position because of the juniorlien loan rightsizing and debt forgiveness associated with these situations are becoming more frequent as borrowers realize the impact to their credit is minor and that a default on a juniorlien loan is not likely to cause borrowers to lose their home  all residential mortgage loans greater than 150days past due are chargeddown to the estimated value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs the remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed or the loan goes through the foreclosure process for the home equity portfolio virtually all of the defaults represent full chargeoffs as there is no remaining equity creating a lower delinquency rate but a higher nco impact  2013 versus 2012  campi ncos decreased 479 million or 74 primarily reflecting credit quality improvement in the underlying portfolio as well as our ongoing proactive credit management practices also 2013 included significant recoveries from prior year chargeoffs  cre ncos decreased 536 million or 68 reflecting both a reduction in loss events and significant recoveries during 2013 this performance is consistent with our expectations for the portfolio as some degree of quarterly volatility is expected given the low absolute levels of ncos in the portfolio there was no concentration in either geography or project type    51    table of contents automobile ncos increased 11 million or 12 the relatively low levels of ncos reflected the continued high credit quality of originations and a strong resale market for used vehicles the slight increasing trend was expected given the absolute low levels achieved in 2012  home equity ncos decreased 341 million or 29 primarily reflecting improved delinquency rates and fewer significant dollar size losses compared to the prior year the impact from the chapter 7 bankruptcy treatment decision inflated the 2012 results with an additional lesser impact in 2013 absent the chapter 7 bankruptcy impact the improvement would have been 15 year over year  residential mortgage ncos declined 208 million or 43 and reflected improvement in the overall housing market compared to the prior year  market risk  market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities we incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads we have identified two primary sources of market risk interest rate risk and price risk  interest rate risk  overview  huntington actively manages interest rate risk as changes in market interest rates can have a significant impact on reported earnings the interest rate risk process is designed to compare income simulations in market scenarios designed to alter the direction magnitude and speed of interest rate changes as well as the slope of the yield curve these scenarios are designed to illustrate the embedded optionality in the balance sheet from among other things faster or slower mortgage prepayments and changes in deposit mix  income simulation and economic value analysis  interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the alco monthly and roc at least quarterly the information reported includes periodend results and identifies any policy limits exceeded along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution mitigation or assumption of the risk  huntington uses two approaches to model interest rate risk interest sensitive earnings at risk ise analysis and economic value of equity eve analysis under ise analysis net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets liabilities and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a oneyear time horizon market implied forward rates and various likely and extreme interest rate scenarios are used for ise analysis these likely and extreme scenarios include rapid and gradual interest rate ramps rate shocks and yield curve twists eve analysis measures the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change  table 20interest sensitive earnings at risk                        net interest income at risk      basis point change scenario     25       100       200                                     board policy limits             20       40                                      december 31 2013     04      02      00   the ise results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management it models gradual 25 100 and 200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates over the next oneyear period beyond the interest rate change implied by the forward yield curve due to the current low level of shortterm interest rates the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of 25 basis points the point at which many assets and liabilities reach zero percent  huntington is within board policy limits for the 100 and 200 basis point scenarios there is no policy limit for the 25 basis point scenario the ise analysis reported at december 31 2013 shows that huntingtons earnings are not significantly sensitive to changes in interest rates due to an increase in the amount of fixed rate assets consisting primarily of indirect auto loans and fixed rate securities the amount of asset sensitivity declined through the year the scenarios above also include the impact of market rate changes on the duration of fixedrate mortgagerelated assets which extend as rates rise and reduce asset sensitivity as interest rates rise the net earnings from our interest rate swaps declines faster under the 200 than 100 basis point scenario resulting in lower asset sensitivity as shown above    52    table of contents table 21economic

immediate 25 100 and 200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates due to the current low level of shortterm interest rates the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of 25 basis points the point at which many assets and liabilities reach zero percent  huntington is within board policy limits for the 100 and 200 basis point scenarios there is no policy limit for the 25 basis point scenario the eve at risk reported at december 31 2013 shows that as interest rates increase decrease immediately the economic value of equity position will decrease increase when interest rates rise fixed rate assets generally lose economic value the longer the duration the greater the value lost the opposite is true when interest rates fall  compared to recent periods the eve results for december 31 2013 reflect the impact of additional mortgagebacked securities which were added to increase the amount of highly liquid assets in our investment portfolio and higher market rates  msr  this section should be read in conjunction with note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  at december 31 2013 we had a total of 1623 million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service 152 billion in mortgage loans of this 1623 million 342 million was recorded using the fair value method and 1281 million was recorded using the amortization method  msr fair values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be greatly reduced by prepayments prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise we have employed strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment in addition we engage a third party to provide valuation tools and assistance with our strategies with the objective to decrease the volatility from msr fair value changes however volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these hedges we typically report msr fair value adjustments net of hedgerelated trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking income  msrs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with historically low interest rates resulting in a lower probability of prepayments and ultimately impairment msr assets are included in accrued income and other assets in the consolidated financial statements  price risk  price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting we have price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions equity investments investments in securities backed by mortgage loans and marketable equity securities held by our insurance subsidiaries we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held by the insurance subsidiaries   liquidity risk  liquidity risk is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments resulting from external macro market issues investor and customer perception of financial strength and events unrelated to us such as war terrorism or financial institution market specific issues in addition the mix and maturity structure of huntingtons balance sheet the amount of onhand cash and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding can have an impact on huntingtons ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments we manage liquidity risk at both the bank and the parent company    53    table of contents the overall objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can obtain costeffective funding to meet current and future obligations and can maintain sufficient levels of onhand liquidity under both normal businessasusual and unanticipated stressed circumstances the alco was appointed by the roc to oversee liquidity risk management and the establishment of liquidity risk policies and limits contingency funding plans are in place which measure forecasted sources and uses of funds under various scenarios in order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages liquidity risk is reviewed monthly for the bank and the parent company as well as its subsidiaries in addition liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions provide policy guidance review funding strategies and oversee the adherence to and maintenance of the contingency funding plans  availableforsale and other securities portfolio

brokered deposits and negotiable cds deposits in foreign offices shortterm borrowings fhlb advances other longterm debt and subordinated notes at december 31 2013 total wholesale funding was 70 billion an increase from 52 billion at december 31 2012 the increase from prior year primarily relates to an increase in other longterm debt and fhlb borrowings partially offset by a decrease in subordinated notes and shortterm borrowings the amounts included in wholesale funding at december 31 2013 had a weighted average maturity of 295 years    57    table of contents in august 2013 the

funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders debt service income taxes operating expenses funding of nonbank subsidiaries repurchases of our stock and acquisitions the parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from interest received from the bank interest and dividends received from direct subsidiaries net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return fees for services provided to subsidiaries and the issuance of debt securities  at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 the parent company had 10 billion and 09 billion respectively in cash and cash equivalents  based on the current quarterly dividend of 005 per common share cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately 415 million per quarter based on the current dividend cash demands required for series a preferred stock are estimated to be approximately 77 million per quarter cash demands required for series b preferred stock are expected to be approximately 03 million per quarter the preferred a and b dividends are payable on april 15 2014 to shareholders of record on april 1 2014  based on a regulatory dividend limitation the bank could not have declared and paid a dividend to the parent company until december 31 2013 without regulatory approval due to the deficit position of its undivided profits we anticipate that the bank will declare dividends to the holding company during the first half of 2014 to help meet any additional liquidity needs we have an openended automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the sec which permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities    58    table of contents with the exception of the items discussed above the parent company does not have any significant cash demands it is our policy to keep operating cash on hand at the parent company to satisfy cash demands for the next 18 months  in august 2013 the parent company issued 4000 million of senior notes at 998 of face value the senior note issuances mature on august 2 2018 and have a fixed coupon rate of 260 the senior note issuances may be redeemed one month prior to the maturity date at 100 of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest  on october 24 2013 the occ us treasury frb and the fdic issued an npr regarding the implementation of a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with the lcr standard established by the basel committee on banking supervision the requirements are designed to promote the short term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks to which it applies comments on the requirement could be submitted until january 31 2014 if implemented as proposed the requirement will likely cause some banks including us to purchase additional amounts of unencumbered high quality liquid assets which can easily be converted into cash  considering the factors discussed above and other analyses that we have performed we believe the parent company has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future  offbalance sheet arrangements  in the normal course of business we enter into various offbalance sheet arrangements these arrangements include financial guarantees contained in standby lettersofcredit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans  standby lettersofcredit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements including commercial paper bond financing and similar transactions most of these arrangements mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon standby lettersofcredit are included in the determination of the amount of riskbased capital that the parent company and the bank are required to hold  through our credit process we monitor the credit risks of outstanding standby lettersofcredit when it is probable that a standby letterofcredit will be drawn and not repaid in full a loss is recognized in the provision for credit losses at december 31 2013 we had 4398 million of standby lettersofcredit outstanding of which 84 were collateralized included in this 4398 million are lettersofcredit issued by the bank that support securities that were issued by our customers and remarketed by the huntington investment company our brokerdealer subsidiary  we enter into forward contracts relating to the mortgage banking business to hedge the exposures we have from commitments to extend new residential mortgage loans to our customers and from our mortgage loans held for sale at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 we had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of 4526 million and 8498 million respectively these contracts mature in less than one year  we do not believe that offbalance sheet arrangements will have a material

operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error inadequate or failed internal systems and controls violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters and security risks we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations and to improve the oversight of our operational risk for example we actively and continuously monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to efraud and loss of sensitive customer data we evaluate internal systems processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any material losses  to mitigate operational risks we have established a senior management operational risk committee and a senior management legal regulatory and compliance committee the responsibilities of these committees among other duties include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns risks or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues both of these committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the risk management committee additionally potential concerns may be escalated to our roc as appropriate  the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies minimize operational and fraud losses and enhance our overall performance  representation and warranty reserve  we primarily conduct our mortgage loan sale and securitization activity with fnma and fhlmc in connection with these and other securitization transactions we make certain representations and warranties that the loans meet certain criteria such as collateral type and underwriting standards we may be required to repurchase individual loans and  or indemnify these organizations against losses due to a loan not meeting the established criteria as part of the consumer portfolio review that was initiated during the 2013 third quarter see consumer credit section for description we continue to evaluate representation and warranty exposure of loans sold with servicing retained associated with borrowers who filed bankruptcy we have a reserve for such losses and exposure which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities the reserves are estimated based on historical and expected repurchase activity average loss rates and current economic trends the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon economic factors investor demand strategies and other external conditions containing a level of uncertainty and risk that may change over the life of the underlying loans we currently do not have sufficient information to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss related to representation and warranty exposure  the tables below reflect activity in the representations and warranties reserve  table 30summary of reserve for representations and warranties on mortgage loans serviced for

reflected an increase in retained earnings partially offset by the repurchase of 167 million common shares and the impacts related to the payments of dividends  shareholders equity  we generate shareholders equity primarily through earnings net of dividends other potential sources of shareholders equity include issuances of common and preferred stock our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives to meet both regulatory and market expectations and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities shareholders equity totaled 61 billion at december 31 2013 representing a 03 billion or 5 increase compared with december 31 2012 primarily due to an increase in retained earnings  dividends  we consider disciplined capital management as a key objective with dividends representing one component our strong capital ratios and expectations for continued earnings growth positions us to continue to actively explore additional capital management opportunities  on january 16 2014 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 005 per common share payable on april 1

share repurchases  from time to time the board of directors authorizes the company to repurchase shares of our common stock although we announce when the board of directors authorizes share repurchases we do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares future stock repurchases may be private or openmarket repurchases including block transactions accelerated or delayed block transactions forward transactions and similar transactions various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases including our capital requirements the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions market conditions including the trading price of our stock and regulatory and legal considerations including the frbs response to our capital plan  our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program consistent with our capital plan of the potential repurchase of up to 2270 million of common stock during 2013 we repurchased 167 million common shares at a weighted average share price of 746 huntington has the ability to repurchase up to 136 million of additional shares of common stock through the first quarter of 2014 we intend to continue disciplined repurchase activity consistent with our annual capital plan our capital return objectives and market conditions  business segment discussion  overview  we have four major business segments retail and business banking regional and commercial banking automobile finance and commercial real estate and wealth advisors government finance and home lending a treasury  other function also includes our insurance business and other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expenses while this section reviews financial performance from a business segment perspective it should be read in conjunction with the discussion of results of operations note 25 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and other sections for a full understanding of our consolidated financial performance  business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions  revenue sharing  revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations  expense allocation  the management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from treasury  other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury  other expenses except those related to our insurance business reported significant items except for the goodwill impairment and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the four business segments    63    table of contents funds transfer pricing ftp  we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury  other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury  other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilities  net income by business segment  the segregation of net income by business segment for the past three years is presented in the following table  table 34net income by business segment                        year ended december 31     dollar amounts in thousands   2013     2012     2011     retail and business

treasury  other function includes revenue and expense related to our insurance business and assets liabilities and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the four business segments other assets include investment securities and bank owned life insurance the financial impact associated with our ftp methodology as described above is also included  net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios and the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity noninterest income includes insurance income miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments such as bank owned life insurance income and any investment security and trading asset gains or losses noninterest expense includes any insurancerelated expenses as well as certain corporate administrative merger and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments the provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 35 tax rate though our overall effective tax rate is lower as a result treasury  other reflects a credit for income taxes representing the difference between the lower actual effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate used to allocate income taxes to the business segments  the 575 million or 45 year over year increase in net income for treasuryother was primarily the result of the ftp process described above the ftp process produced increased net income for treasuryother as the sustained low market interest rate environment combined with a shift in funding mix to include additional wholesale sources resulted in lower ftp credits paid to the business segments  optimal customer relationship ocr  our ocr initiative is a crossbusiness segment strategy designed to increase overall customer profitability and retention by deepening product and service penetration to consumer and commercial customers we believe this can be accomplished by taking our broad array of services and products and delivering them through a rigorous and disciplined sales management process that is consistent across all business segments and regions it is also supported by robust sales and crossreferral technology  ocr was introduced in late 2009 through 2010 much of the effort was spent on defining processes sales training and systems development to fully capture and measure ocr performance metrics in 2011 we introduced ocrrelated metrics for commercial relationships which complements the previously disclosed consumer ocrrelated metrics in 2013 we continue to experience strong consumer household and commercial relationship growth    64    table of contents consumer ocr performance  for consumer ocr performance there are three key performance metrics 1 the number of checking account households 2 the number of product penetration per consumer checking household and 3 the revenue generated from the consumer households of all business segments  the growth in consumer checking account number of households is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing checking account households the overall objective is to grow the number of households along with an increase in product penetration  we use the checking account since it typically represents the primary banking relationship product we count additional services by type not number of services for example a household that has one checking account and one mortgage we count as having two services a household with four checking accounts we count as having one service the household relationship utilizing four or more services is viewed to be more profitable and loyal the overall objective therefore is to decrease the percentage of 13 services per consumer checking account household while increasing the percentage of those with 4 or more services since we have made significant strides toward having the vast majority of our customers with 4 services during the 2013 second quarter we changed our measurement to 6 services we are holding ourselves to a higher performance standard  the following table presents consumer checking account household ocr

millions    9481      9834                          our emphasis on crosssell coupled with customers increasingly being attracted by the benefits offered through our fair play banking philosophy with programs such as 24hour grace on overdrafts and asteriskfree checking are having a positive effect the percent of consumer households with 6 services at the end of 2013 was 476 up from 472 at the end of last year for 2013 consumer checking account households grew 8 total consumer checking account household revenue in 2013 was 9481 million down 353 million or 4 from 2012 household revenue was negatively impacted by the february 2013 implementation of a new posting order for consumer transactions  commercial ocr performance  for commercial ocr performance there are three key performance metrics 1 the number of commercial relationships 2 the number of services penetration per commercial relationship and 3 the revenue generated commercial relationships include relationships from all business segments  the growth in the number of commercial relationships is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing commercial accounts the overall objective is to grow the number of relationships along with an increase in product service distribution  the commercial relationship is defined as a business banking or commercial banking customer with a checking account relationship we use this metric because we believe that the checking account anchors a business relationship and creates the opportunity to increase our crosssell multiple sales of the same type of service are counted as one service the same as consumer    65    table of contents the following table presents commercial relationship ocr metrics  table 36commercial relationship

quarter at december 31 2013 and 2012 we had a net deferred tax asset of 1376 million and 2039 million respectively  credit quality  credit quality performance in the 2013 fourth quarter reflected continued improvement in the overall loan portfolio relating to nco activity as well as in key credit quality metrics including a 21 decline in npas  ncos  total ncos for the 2013 fourth quarter were 464 million or an annualized 043 of average total loans and leases ncos in the yearago quarter were 701 million or an annualized 069 these declines reflected improvement in the overall credit quality of the portfolio  nals  total nals were 3221 million at december 31 2013 and represented 075 of total loans and leases this was down 856 million or 21 from 4076 million or 100 of total loans and leases at the end of the year ago period this decrease primarily reflected substantial improvement in the campi and cre portfolio partially offset by an increase in consumer nals resulting from chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans    77    table of contents acl  this section should be read in conjunction with note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  acl as a percent of total loans and leases at december 31 2013 was 165 down from 199 at december 31 2012 we believe the decline in the ratio is appropriate given the continued improvement in the risk profile of our loan portfolio further we believe that early identification of loans with changes in credit metrics and aggressive action plans for these loans combined with originating high quality new loans will contribute to continued improvement in our key credit quality metrics   78    table of contents table 46selected quarterly income statement data1                            2013     dollar amounts in

nonregulatory capital ratios  in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including         tangible common equity to tangible assets         tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets using basel i and basel iii definitions and         tangible common equity to riskweighted assets using basel i definition  these nonregulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the companys capitalization to other financial services companies these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies these ratios are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap or federal banking regulations as a result these nonregulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company are considered nongaap financial measures  because there are no standardized definitions for these nonregulatory capital ratios the companys calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies also there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors as a result the company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10k in

incorporated by reference into this mdampa additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the risk management and capital discussion as well as the regulatory matters section included in item 1 and incorporated by reference into the mdampa  critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates  our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference into this mdampa describes the significant accounting policies we use in our consolidated financial statements  an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below  allowance for credit losses  our acl of 07 billion at december 31 2013 represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risk associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations    83    table of contents in addition bank regulators periodically review our acl and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan chargeoffs any increase in our acl or loan chargeoffs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  goodwill impairment  goodwill is an intangible asset representing the difference between the purchase price of an asset and its fair market value and is created when a company pays a premium to acquire another company we test goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a twostep process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit goodwill impairment exists when a reporting units carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value goodwill is also tested for impairment on an interim basis using the same twostep process as the annual testing if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount  significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment this judgment includes developing cash flow projections selecting appropriate discount rates identifying relevant market comparables incorporating general economic and market conditions and selecting an appropriate control premium the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value  the first step step 1 of impairment testing requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill to its carrying value to identify potential impairment for our annual impairment testing conducted during 2013 we identified four reporting units with goodwill retail and business banking regional and commercial banking wealth advisors government finance and home lending wgh and insurance auto finance and commercial real estate was not subject to impairment testing as it had no goodwill associated with the unit in addition although insurance is included within treasuryother for business segment reporting it was evaluated as a separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing because it had its own separately allocated goodwill resulting from prior acquisitions and met the reporting unit criteria  for all four reporting units identified in the above paragraph we utilized both income and market approaches to determine the fair value for each reporting unit the income approach was based on discounted cash flows derived from assumptions of balance sheet and income statement activity an internal forecast was developed by considering several longterm key business drivers such as anticipated loan and deposit growth net interest margins and efficiency ratios longterm growth rates were estimated to assist in determining the terminal values the discount rates were estimated based on the capital asset pricing model which considered the riskfree interest rate 20year treasury bonds marketrisk premium equityrisk premium and a companyspecific risk factor the companyspecific risk factor was used to address the uncertainty of growth estimates and earnings projections of management for the market approach revenue earnings and market capitalization multiples of comparable public companies were selected and applied to each reporting units applicable metrics such as book and tangible book values the results of the income and market approaches are combined to arrive at the final calculation of fair value all four of the reporting units tested passed step 1  the second step step 2 of impairment testing is necessary only if the reporting unit does not pass step 1 step 2 compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as none of the reporting units failed step 1 step 2 was not applicable during 2013 testing  due to potential economic uncertainties it is possible that our estimates and assumptions may adversely change in the future if our market capitalization decreases we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing or prior to that time if any changes constitute a triggering event  valuation of financial instruments  assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility assets measured at fair value include mortgage loans held for sale availableforsale and trading securities certain securitized automobile loans derivatives and certain securitization trust notes payable at december 31 2013 approximately 76 billion of our assets and 01 billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value in addition to the above mentioned ongoing fair value measurements fair value is also the unit of measure for recording business combinations and other nonrecurring financial assets and liabilities   at the end of each quarter we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured at fair value as necessary assets or liabilities may be transferred within fair value hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date    84    table of contents where available we use quoted market prices to determine fair value if quoted market prices are not available fair value is determined using either internally developed or independent third party valuation models based on inputs that are either directly observable or derived from market data these inputs include but are not limited to interest rate yield curves option volatilities or option adjusted spreads where neither quoted market prices nor observable market data are available fair value is determined using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on managements expectation that market participants would use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability the determination of appropriate unobservable inputs requires exercise of management judgment a significant portion of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value are measured based on quoted market prices and observable market or independent inputs  the following is a description of the significant estimates used in the valuation of financial assets and liabilities for which quoted market prices and observable market parameters are not available  mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities  our alta private label cmo and pooledtrustpreferred securities portfolios are classified as level 3 and as such use significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the alta and private label cmo securities portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows while the cash flows of our pooledtrustpreferred securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties and are used as a basis for impairment analysis  alta mortgagebacked and privatelabel cmo securities are collateralized by firstlien residential mortgage loans the securities valuation methodology incorporates values obtained from a third party pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and a proprietary pricing model and includes assumptions management believes market participants would use to value the securities under current market conditions the model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds losses recoveries default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures house price depreciation  appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts and discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities with similar collateral structures  pooledtrustpreferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio we engage a third party pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooledtrustpreferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio the pd of each issuer and the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value management evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the third party pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter actual defaults and deferrals in the current period and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with asc 820  derivatives used for hedging purposes  derivatives designated as qualified hedges are tested for hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis assessments are made at the inception of the hedge and on a recurring basis to determine whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item a statistical regression analysis is performed to measure the effectiveness  if based on the assessment a derivative is not expected to be a highly effective hedge or it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge hedge accounting is discontinued as of the quarter the hedge is not highly effective as the statistical regression analysis requires the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are sensitive to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates we consider this a critical accounting estimate  loans held for sale  huntington has elected to apply the fair value option to certain residential mortgage loans that are classified as held for sale at origination the fair value is estimated based on security prices for similar product types  certain consumer and commercial loans are classified as held for sale and are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value the determination of fair value for these consumer loans is based on security prices for similar product types or discounted expected cash flows which takes into consideration factors such as future interest rates prepayment speeds default and loss curves and market discount rates the determination of fair value for commercial loans takes into account factors such as the location and appraised value of the related collateral as well as the estimated cash flows from realization of the collateral    85    table of contents mortgage servicing rights  retained rights to service mortgage loans are recognized as a separate and distinct asset at the time the loans are sold mortgage servicing rights msrs are initially recorded at fair value at the time the related loans are sold and subsequently remeasured at each reporting date under either the fair value or amortization method any increase or decrease in fair value of msrs accounted for under the fair value method as well as any amortization andor impairment of msrs recorded under the amortization method is reflected in earnings in the period that the changes occur msrs are subject to interest rate risk in that their fair value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment fair value is determined based upon the application of an income approach valuation model the valuation model maintained by an independent third party incorporates assumptions in estimating future cash flows these assumptions include time decay payoffs and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions the reasonableness of these pricing models is validated on a minimum of a quarterly basis by at least one independent external service broker valuation because the fair values of msrs are significantly impacted by the use of estimates the use of different assumption estimates can result in different estimated fair values of those msrs  pension valuation  pension plan assets consist of mutual funds corporate bonds us government bonds our common stock and other investment assets investments are accounted for at cost on the trade date and are reported at fair value mutual funds are valued at quoted net asset value our common stock is traded on a national securities exchange and is valued at the last reported sales price  the discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to determine the benefit obligation and pension expense are both significant assumptions actual results may be materially different see note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  contingent liabilities  we are parties to various claims litigation and legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current andor former operations we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a casebycase basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering among other factors the progress of each case or proceeding our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings and the opinions and views of legal counsel litigation exposure represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our control  income taxes  the calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments we have two accruals for income taxes 1 our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal state and local taxing jurisdictions net of any reserve for potential audit issues and any tax refunds and the net receivable balance is reported as a component of accrued income and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 2 our deferred federal and state income tax and related valuation accounts reported as a component of accrued income and other assets represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under gaap and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under federal and state tax law  in the ordinary course of business we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes the effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws we believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements we review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions in addition we rely on various tax opinions recent tax audits and historical experience  from timetotime we engage in business transactions that may affect our tax liabilities where appropriate we have obtained opinions of outside experts and have assessed the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking into account statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position however changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates implementation of new business strategies resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance such changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position and  or results of operations see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements    86    table of contents deferred tax assets  at december 31 2013 we had a net federal deferred tax asset of 979 million and a net state deferred tax asset of 397 million a valuation allowance is provided when it is morelikelythannot that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized all available evidence both positive and negative was considered to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence impairment should be recognized our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change if our forecast of taxable income within the carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets such assets may be impaired based on our analysis of both positive and negative evidence and our ability to offset the net deferred tax assets against our forecasted future taxable income there was no impairment of the net deferred tax assets at december 31 2013 for regulatory capital purposes  recent accounting pronouncements and developments  note 2 to consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2013 and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affect financial condition results of operations or liquidity the impacts are discussed in the applicable section of this mdampa and the notes to
