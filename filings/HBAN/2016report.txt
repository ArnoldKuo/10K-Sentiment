contentsnondepository entities of a holding company on its subsidiary depository institutions the ratings assigned to us like those assigned to other financial institutions are confidential and may not be disclosed except to the extent required by lawunder the doddfrank act because we are a bank holding company with consolidated assets greater than 50 billion we are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards as a result we expect to be subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable to smaller institutions including with respect to capital requirements leverage limits and stress testing the federal reserve has issued supervisory guidance which sets forth an updated framework for the consolidated supervision of large financial institutions including bank holding companies with consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the objectives of the framework are to enhance the resilience of a firm lower the probability of its failure and reduce the impact on the financial system in the event of an institutions failure with regard to resiliency each firm is expected to ensure that the consolidated organization and its core business lines can survive under a broad range of internal or external stresses this requires financial resilience by maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity and operational resilience by maintaining effective corporate governance risk management and recovery planning with respect to lowering the probability of failure each firm is expected to ensure the sustainability of its critical operations and banking offices under a broad range of internal or external stresses this requires among other things that we have robust forwardlooking capitalplanning processes that account for our unique risksthe bank which is

institutions including national banks with 50 billion or more in average total consolidated assets such as the bank the guidelines became effective november 10 2014 and require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risktaking activities in addition the guidelines provide standards for the institutions boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework given its size and the phased implementation schedule the bank is subject to these heightened standards effective may 2016 as discussed in item 1a risk factors the bank currently has a written governance framework and associated controlslegislative and regulatory reforms continue to have significant impacts throughout the financial services industrythe doddfrank act enacted in 2010 is complex and broad in scope and several of its provisions are still being implemented the doddfrank act established the cfpb which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services and the financial stability oversight council which has oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk in addition the doddfrank act altered the authority and duties of the federal banking and securities regulatory agencies implemented certain corporate governance requirements for all public companies including financial institutions with regard to executive compensation proxy access by shareholders and certain whistleblower provisions and restricted certain proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks and their affiliates the doddfrank act also required the issuance of numerous implementing regulations many of which have not yet been issued the regulations will continue to take effect over several more years continuing to make it difficult to anticipate the overall impact to us our customers or the financial industry in generalon october 3 2015 the cfpbs final rules on integrated mortgage disclosures under the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act became effective on january 1 2016 most requirements of the occs final rule in loans in areas having special flood hazards the flood final rule became effective including the requirement that flood insurance premiums and fees for most mortgage loans be escrowed subject to certain exceptions the flood final rule also incorporated other existing flood insurance requirements and exceptions eg the exemption from flood insurance requirements for nonresidential detached structures  a discretionary item with those portions of the flood final rule becoming effective on october 1 2015 we continue to monitor evaluate and implement these new regulationsthroughout 2015 the cfpb continued its focus on fair lending practices of indirect automobile lenders this focus led to some lenders to enter into consent orders with the cfpb and department of justice indirect automobile lenders have also received continued pressure from the cfpb to limit or eliminate discretionary pricing by dealers finally the cfpb has implemented its 11table of contentslarger participant rule for indirect automobile lending which brings larger nonbank indirect automobile lenders under cfpb supervisionbanking regulatory agencies have increasingly used their authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices udap by banks under standards developed many years ago by the federal trade commission in order to address practices that may not necessarily fall within the scope of a specific banking or consumer finance law the doddfrank act also gave to the cfpb similar authority to take action in connection with unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices udaap by entities subject to cfpb supervisory or enforcement authority banks face considerable uncertainty as to the regulatory interpretation of abusive practicesfinancial services companies face increased regulation and exposure under the new military lending act mla final rules issued by the department of defense that become effective for new loans entered into on and after october 3 2016 the new rules dramatically expand the scope of coverage of the mla and compliance with the new rules will affect operations of more financial services companies than under the previous rules on july 10 2015 the federal communication commission interpreting the telephone consumer protection act issued an omnibus declaratory ruling and order that among other things restricted the use of automated telephone dialing machines the ruling effectively increases the cost of collecting debts as well as increases the litigation risk associated with the use of autodialerslarge bank holding companies and national banks are required to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve and occ respectively and conduct stress teststhe federal reserves regulation y requires large bank holding companies to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and requires such bank holding companies to obtain approval from the federal reserve under certain circumstances before making a capital distribution this rule applies to us and all other bank holding companies with 50 billion or more of total consolidated assetsa large bank holding companys capital plan must include an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over at least the next nine quarters a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon a detailed description of the entitys process for assessing capital adequacy the entitys capital policy and a discussion of any expected changes to the bank holding companys business plan that are likely to have a material impact on the firms capital adequacy or liquidity the planning horizon for the most recently completed capital planning and stress testing cycle encompasses the 2014 fourth quarter through the 2016 fourth quarter as was submitted in our capital plan in january 2015 rules to implement the basel iii capital reforms in the united states were finalized in july 2013 and are being phasedin by us beginning with 1q 2015 results under the standardized approach capital adequacy at large banking organizations including us is assessed against a minimum 45 cet1 ratio and a 4 tier 1 leverage ratio as determined by the federal reservecapital plans for 2016 are required to be submitted to the federal reserve by april 5 2016 and the federal reserve will either object to the capital plan andor planned capital actions or provide a notice of nonobjection no later than june 30 2016 we intend to submit our capital plan to the federal reserve on or before april 5 2016 there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will respond favorably to our capital plan capital actions or stress test and the federal reserve occ or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including common stock dividends and stock repurchasesin addition to the ccar submission section 165 of the doddfrank act requires that national banks like the huntington national bank conduct annual stress tests for submission beginning in january 2015 the results of the stress tests will provide the occ with forwardlooking information that will be used in bank supervision and will assist the agency in assessing a companys risk profile and capital adequacy we submitted our stress test results to the occ in january 2015 we intend to submit our 2016 capital plan to the occ on or before april 5 2016 the regulatory capital rules indicate that common stockholders equity should be the dominant element within tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on noncommon equity elements under the doddfrank act the ratio of common equity tier 1 to riskweighted assets became significant as a measurement of the predominance of common equity in tier 1 capital and an indication of the quality of capital in accordance with their requirementsconforming covered activities to implement the volcker ruleon december 10 2013 the federal reserve the occ the fdic the cftc and the sec issued final rules to implement the volcker rule contained in section 619 of the doddfrank act

12table of contentsas a bank holding company and any of their subsidiaries and affiliates collectively banking entities from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining

and definitions on december 18 2014 the federal reserve announced it acted under section 619 to give banking entities until july 21 2016 to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to december 31 2013 legacy covered funds the federal reserve also announced its intention to act this year to grant banking entities an additional oneyear extension of the conformance period until july 21 2017 to conform ownership interests in and relationships with legacy covered funds the bank continues its good faith efforts to conform with proprietary trading prohibitions and associated compliance requirements the company does not expect volcker compliance to have a material impact on its business modelthe volcker rules prohibitions impact the ability of us banking entities to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with nonus banking organizations in overseas markets the rule also effectively prohibits shortterm trading strategies by any us banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for tradingthe final volcker rule regulations do provide certain exemptions allowing banking entities to continue underwriting marketmaking and hedging activities and trading certain government obligations as well as various exemptions and exclusions from the definition of covered funds the level of required compliance activity depends on the size of the banking entity and the extent of its trading ceos of larger banking entities including huntington have to attest annually in writing that their organization has in place processes to establish maintain enforce review test and modify compliance with the volcker rule regulations banking entities with significant permitted trading operations will have to report certain quantitative information beginning between june 30 2014 and december 31 2016 depending on

collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of the volcker rule under the interim final rule the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities if certain qualifications are met in addition the agencies released a nonexclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of the interim final rule at december 31 2015 we had investments in eight different pools of trust preferred securities seven of our pools are included in the list of nonexclusive issuers we have analyzed the other pool that was not included on the list and believe that we will continue to be able to own this investment under the final volcker rule regulationsthere are restrictions on our ability to

in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice such authority may require after notice and hearing that such bank cease and desist from such practice depending on the financial condition of the bank the applicable regulatory authority might deem us to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice if the bank were to pay dividends to the holding companythe federal reserve and the occ have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings additionally the federal reserve may prohibit or limit bank holding companies from making capital distributions including payment of preferred and common dividends as part of the annual capital plan approval processwe are subject to the current capital requirements mandated by the federal reserve and basel iii capital and liquidity frameworksthe federal reserve sets riskbased capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies under the guidelines and related policies bank holding companies must maintain capital sufficient to meet both a riskbased asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis the riskbased ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet commitments into riskweighted categories with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived as representing greater risk the riskbased ratio represents total capital divided by total riskweighted assets the leverage ratio is core capital divided by total assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines the bank is subject to substantially similar capital requirements13table of contentsin 2013 the federal reserve and the occ adopted final capital rules implementing basel iii requirements for us banking organizations the final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and implement in the united states the basel iii regulatory capital reforms from the basel committee on banking supervision and certain changes required by the doddfrank act under the final rule minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations consistent with the international basel framework the final rule includes a new minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and a capital conservation buffer of 25 of riskweighted assets that will apply to all supervised financial institutions the rule also raises the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4 these new minimum capital ratios were effective for us on january 1 2015 and will be fully phasedin on january 1 2019the following are the basel iii regulatory capital levels that we must satisfy to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments during the applicable transition period from january 1 2015 until january 1 2019  basel iii regulatory capital levels

rule also improves the methodology for calculating riskweighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity banks and regulators use risk weighting to assign different levels of risk to different classes of assetsbased on the final basel iii rule banking organizations with more than 15 billion in total consolidated assets are required to phaseout of additional tier 1 capital any nonqualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred shares issued before september 12 2010 we began the additional tier 1 capital phaseout of our trust preferred securities in 2015 but will be able to include these instruments in tier 2 capital as a nonadvanced approaches institutionunder basel iii cet1 predominantly includes common stockholders equity less certain deductions for goodwill and other intangible assets net of related taxes overfunded net pension fund assets and dtas that arise from tax loss and credit carryforwards we elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from cet1 as permitted in the final rule tier 1 capital is predominantly comprised of cet1 as well as perpetual preferred stock and qualifying minority interests total capital predominantly includes tier 1 capital as well as certain longterm debt and allowance for credit losses qualifying for tier 2 capital the calculations of cet1 tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital include phaseout periods for certain instruments from january 2015 through december 2017 the primary items subject to the phaseout from capital for us are other intangible assets dtas that arise from tax loss and credit carryforwards and trust preferred securitiesriskweighted assets under the basel iii standardized approach are generally based on supervisory risk weightings that vary only by counterparty type and asset class the revisions to supervisory risk weightings for basel iii enhance risk sensitivity and include alternatives to the use of credit ratings when calculating the risk weight for certain assets specifically basel iii includes a more risksensitive treatment for past due and nonaccrual loans certain commercial loans msrs and certain unfunded commitments basel iii also prescribes a new formulaic approach for calculating the risk weight of securitization exposures that is also more risk sensitivefailure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the financial institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities these include limitations on the ability to pay dividends the issuance by the regulatory authority of a directive to increase capital and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic in addition the financial institution could be subject to the measures described below under prompt corrective action as applicable to undercapitalized institutionsthe riskbased capital standards of the federal reserve the occ and the fdic specify that evaluations by the banking agencies of a banks capital adequacy will include an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of a banks capital due to changes in interest rates these banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active oversight of risk management activities by senior management14table of

fdicia establishes five capital tiers wellcapitalized adequatelycapitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalizedthroughout 2015 our regulatory capital ratios and those of the bank were in excess of the levels established for wellcapitalized institutions an institution is deemed to be wellcapitalized if it meets or exceeds the wellcapitalized minimums

depository institution would become undercapitalized after such payment undercapitalized institutions are also subject to growth limitations and are required by the appropriate federal banking agency to submit a capital restoration plan if any depository institution subsidiary of a holding company is required to submit a capital restoration plan the holding company would be required to provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of such plandepending upon the severity of the under capitalization the undercapitalized institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequatelycapitalized requirements to reduce total assets cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks and restrictions on making any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming so classifiedunder fdicia a wellcapitalized bank may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval a depository institution that is not wellcapitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market since the bank is wellcapitalized the fdicia brokered deposit rule did not adversely affect its ability to accept brokered deposits the bank had 29 billion of such brokered deposits at december 31 2015on september 3 2014 the us banking regulators approved a final rule to implement the us version of the basel committees minimum liquidity coverage ratio lcr requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more and a less stringent modified lcr requirement to depository institution holding companies below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the lcr requires covered banking organizations to maintain an amount of unencumbered hqla equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendarday stress scenario we are covered by the modified lcr requirement and therefore subject to the initial phasein of the rule beginning in january 2016 with the requirement fully phasedin january 2017 we will also be required to calculate the lcr monthly the modified lcr is a minimum requirement and the federal reserve can impose additional liquidity requirements as a supervisory matterwe are required to submit annual resolution plansas a bank holding company with greater than 50 billion of assets we are required annually to submit to the federal reserve and the fdic a resolution plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the company in the event of material financial distress or failure if both the federal reserve and the fdic determine that our plan is not credible and the deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner the federal reserve and the fdic may jointly impose on us more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth activities or operations15table of contentsthe fdic separately has adopted a final rule requiring an insured depository institution with 50 billion or more in total assets such as the bank to submit periodically to the fdic a resolution plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure the fdic rule requires each covered institution to provide a resolution plan that should enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the institution in an orderly manner that enables prompt access of insured deposits maximizes the return from the failed institutions assets and minimizes losses realized by creditors and the deposit insurance fund we filed our resolution plans pursuant to each rule in december 2015as a bank holding company we must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the bankunder the doddfrank act a bank holding company must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and must commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank the federal reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank it may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the federal reserve believes might jeopardize the bank holding companys ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bankany loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy an appointed bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank moreover the bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institutions general unsecured creditors including the holders of its note obligationsfederal law permits the occ to order the prorata assessment of shareholders of a national bank whose capital stock has become impaired by losses or otherwise to relieve a deficiency in such national banks capital stock this statute also provides for the enforcement of any such prorata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of capital stock by sale to the extent necessary of the capital stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to pay the assessment as the sole shareholder of the bank we are subject to such provisionsmoreover the claims of a receiver of

imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the banks bank holding company and certain companies the bank holding company may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on armslength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the banks regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bank holding company may be required to provide itprovisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of i the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment advisor ii credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and iii transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction they also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july 21 2012 the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement themas a financial holding company we are subject to additional laws and regulationsas a financial holding company we are permitted to engage in and affiliate with financial companies engaging in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company in order to maintain our status as a financial holding company we and the bank must each remain wellcapitalized and wellmanaged in addition the bank must receive 16table of contentsa community reinvestment act cra rating of at least satisfactory at its most recent examination for us to engage in the full range of activities permissible for financial holding companies pursuant to cra the occ examines the bank to assess the banks record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank and assigns a rating based on that assessment the cra assessment and rating is reviewed by the federal reserve in evaluating a variety of applications including to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of other institutions or to open or relocate a branch officefinancial holding company powers relate to financial activities that are specified in the bank holding company act or determined by the federal reserve in coordination with the secretary of the treasury to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity provided that the complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness risk in addition we are required by the bank holding company act to obtain federal reserve approval prior to acquiring directly or indirectly ownership or control of voting shares of any bank if after such acquisition we would own or control more than 5 of its voting stock furthermore the doddfrank act added a new provision to the bank holding company act which requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than 50 billion to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve to acquire a nondepository company having total consolidated assets of 10 billion or morewe also must comply with antimoney laundering and customer privacy regulations as well as corporate governance accounting and reporting requirementsthe usa patriot act of 2001 and its related regulations require insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions to have

disclosures relating to corporate insiders and insider transactions code of ethics and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reportingthe federal reserve jointly with the occ and fdic has issued guidance to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at financial institutions take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices in addition the federal financial regulators issued a proposed rule in april 2011 pursuant to the doddfrank act to adopt standards for determining whether an incentivebased compensation arrangement may encourage inappropriate risktaking that are consistent with the key principles established for incentive compensation in the guidance the proposed rule would apply to financial institutions with 1 billion or more in assets with heightened standards for financial institutions with 50 billion or more in assets the guidance from the regulators on compensation is still evolving available informationthis

multifaceted approach to risk governance it begins with the board of directors defining our risk appetite as aggregate moderatetolow this does not preclude engagement in select higher risk activities rather the definition is intended to represent an aggregate view of where we want our overall risk to be managedthree board committees primarily oversee implementation of this desired risk appetite and monitoring of our risk profile the audit committee oversees the integrity of the consolidated financial statements including policies procedures and practices regarding the preparation of financial statements the financial reporting process disclosures and internal control over financial reporting the audit committee also provides assistance to the board in overseeing the internal audit division and the independent registered public accounting firms qualifications and independence compliance with our financial code of ethics for the chief executive officer and senior financial officers and compliance with corporate securities trading policiesthe risk oversight committee assists the board of directors in overseeing management of material risks the approval and monitoring of

adherence to the boards stated risk appetite the committee has oversight responsibility with respect to the full range of inherent risks market credit liquidity legal complianceregulatory operational strategic and reputational this committee also oversees our capital management and planning process ensures that the amount and quality of capital are adequate in relation to expected and unexpected risks and that our capital levels exceed wellcapitalized requirements the technology committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to all technology cyber security and thirdparty risk management strategies and plans the committee is charged with evaluating huntingtons capability to properly perform all technology functions necessary for its business plan including projected growth technology capacity planning operational execution product development and management capacity the committee provides oversight of the technology segment investments and plans to drive efficiency as well as to meet defined standards for risk security and redundancy the committee oversees the allocation of technology costs and ensures that they are understood by the board of directors the technology committee monitors and evaluates innovation and technology trends that may affect the companys strategic plans including monitoring of overall industry trends the technology committee reviews and provides oversight of the companys continuity and disaster recovery planning and preparednessthe audit and risk oversight committees routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and risk management on a periodic basis the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both such as the construct and appropriateness of the acl which is reviewed quarterly all directors have access to information provided to each committee and all scheduled meetings are open to all directorsfurther through its compensation committee the board of directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards is risksensitive and aligns the interests of management creditors and shareholders we utilize a variety of compensationrelated tools to induce appropriate behavior including common stock ownership thresholds for the chief executive officer and certain members of senior management a requirement to hold until retirement or exit from the company a portion of net shares received upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards 50 for executive officers and 25 for other award recipients equity deferrals recoupment provisions and the right to terminate compensation plans at any timemanagement has implemented an enterprise risk management and risk appetite framework critically important is our selfassessment process in which each business segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls the segment analyses are combined with assessments by our risk management organization of major risk sectors eg credit market liquidity operational legal compliance reputational and strategic to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment outcomes of the process include a determination of the quality of the overall control process the direction of risk and our position compared to the defined risk appetitemanagement also utilizes a wide series of metrics key risk indicators to monitor risk positions throughout the company in general a range for each metric is established which allows the company in aggregate to operate within an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile deviations from the range will indicate if the risk being measured exceeds desired tolerance which may then necessitate corrective actionwe also have four executive level committees to manage risk alco credit policy and strategy risk management and capital management each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature we believe this structure helps ensure appropriate escalation of issues and overall communication of strategies18table of contentshuntington utilizes three lines of defense with regard to risk management 1 business segments 2 corporate risk management and 3 internal audit and credit review to induce greater ownership of risk within its business segments segment risk officers have been embedded to identify and monitor risk elevate and remediate issues establish controls perform selftesting and oversee the selfassessment process corporate risk management establishes policies sets operating limits reviews new or modified productsprocesses ensures consistency and quality assurance within the segments and produces the enterprise risk assessment the chief risk officer has significant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans as they apply to risk internal audit and credit review provide additional assurance that riskrelated functions are operating as intendedrisk overviewwe like other financial companies are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations many of which are outside of our direct control though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns among the risks assumed are credit risk which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms market risk which occurs when fluctuations in interest rates impact earnings and capital financial impacts are realized through changes in the interest rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities net interest margin or directly through valuation changes of capitalized msr andor trading assets noninterest income liquidity risk which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels liquidity risk also results from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the banks ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value operational and legal risk which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems human errors or misconduct or adverse external events operational losses result from internal fraud external fraud inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety failure to meet professional obligations involving customers products and business practices damage to physical assets business disruption and systems failures and failures in execution delivery and process management legal risk includes but is not limited to exposure to orders fines penalties or punitive damages resulting from litigation as well as regulatory actions and compliance risk which exposes us to money penalties enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws rules and regulations that apply to the financial services industrywe also expend considerable effort to contain risk which emanates from execution of our business processes and strategies and work relentlessly to protect the companys reputation strategic risk and reputational risk do not easily lend themselves to traditional methods of measurement rather we closely monitor them through processes such as new product  initiative reviews frequent financial performance reviews colleague and client surveys monitoring market intelligence periodic discussions between management and our board and other such effortsin addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report readers should carefully consider that the following important factors among others could negatively impact our business future results of operations and future cash flows materiallycredit risks1 our acl level may prove to be inappropriate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could materially adversely affect our net income and capitalour business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers our acl of 670 million at december 31 2015 represented managements estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we periodically review our acl for appropriateness in doing so we consider economic conditions and trends collateral values and credit quality indicators such as past chargeoff experience levels of past due loans and npas there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases if the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsin addition regulatory review of risk ratings and loan and lease losses may impact the level of the acl and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations19table of contents2 weakness in economic conditions could materially adversely affect our businessour performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us our customers and our counterparties these conditions could result in one or more of the followinga decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by usa decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us andan increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to usan increase in the number of delinquencies bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of npas ncos provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale the markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and thus are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectorsmarket risks1 changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income reduce transactional income and negatively impact the value of our loans securities and other assets this could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows financial condition results of operations and capitalour results of operations depend substantially on net interest income which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions conditions such as inflation deflation recession unemployment money supply and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates if our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment net interest income could be materially adversely impacted likewise if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment net interest income could be adversely impacted the continuation of the current low interest rate environment or a deflationary environment with negative interest rates could affect consumer and business behavior in ways that are adverse to us and could also constrict our net interest income margin which may restrict our ability to increase net interest incomechanges in interest rates can affect the value of loans securities assets under management and other assets including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights an increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in npas and a reduction of income recognized which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows when we place a loan on nonaccrual status we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable which decreases interest income however we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding nals without any corresponding interest income in addition transactional income including trust income brokerage income and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from periodtoperiod based on a number of factors including the interest rate environment a decline in interest rates along with a flattening yield curve limits our ability to reprice deposits given the current historically low level of interest rates and could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixedrate securities and cash flow hedging derivatives portfolio any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts oci shareholders equity and the tangible common equity ratio any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios in a rising interest rate environment pension and other postretirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative oci impacts from securities and financial instruments for more information refer to market risk of the mdampacertain investment securities notably mortgagebacked securities are very sensitive to rising and falling rates generally when rates rise prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will increase conversely when rates fall prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will decrease in either case interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgagebacked securitiesthe value of our msr asset is also a function of changes in interest rates and prepayment expectations declining interest rates primarily in the longer end of the yield curve reduces the value of the msr asset in addition to volatility associated with interest rates the company also has exposure to equity markets related to the investments within the benefit plans and other income from client based transactions 20table of contents2 industry competition may have an adverse effect on our successour profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully we operate in a highly competitive environment and we expect competition to intensify due in part to the sustained low interest rate and ongoing lowgrowth economic environment certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits in our market areas we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and therefore may have greater flexibility in competing for business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including customer convenience quality of service by investing in new products and services personal contacts pricing and range of products if we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in particular if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability or a desire to do business with our competitors we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin for more information refer to competition section of item 1 businessliquidity risks1 changes in either huntingtons financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidenceliquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost the bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers the board of directors establishes liquidity policies and limits and management establishes operating guidelines for liquidityour primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers the continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular the availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes eg changes in fdic insurance the liquidity coverage ratio etc and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits while we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding market related geopolitical or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits2 if we lose access to capital markets we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors creditors and borrowers or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activitieswholesale

litigation if unfavorable could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular periodwe face legal risks in our businesses and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters if unfavorable may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting periodnote 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements updates the status of certain material litigation including litigation related to the bankruptcy of cyberco holdings inc 3 we face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and capital marketswe are exposed to many types of operational risks including the risk of fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders unauthorized transactions by colleagues or outsiders operational errors by colleagues business disruption and system failures huntington executes against a significant number of controls a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and thirdparty service providers there is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack these operational risks could lead to financial loss expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and the capital marketsmoreover negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including clients products and business practices corporate governance acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory actionrelative to acquisitions we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions including our pending acquisition of firstmerit corporation acquisitions may be subject to and our pending acquisition of firstmerit corporation is subject to the receipt of approvals from certain governmental authorities including the federal reserve the occ and the united states department of justice as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire these approvals for acquisitions may not be received may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions subject to requisite regulatory approvals future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock which would dilute current shareholders ownership interests additionally acquisitions may also involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction 22table of contents4 failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock priceeffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud as a financial holding company we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures such controls and procedures are modified supplemented and changed from timetotime as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments any failure to maintain in the future an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis which could result in regulatory actions loss of investor confidence and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price5 we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial valuesquantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including estimating probable loan losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk and for capital planning purposes including during the ccar capital planning and capital adequacy process our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses particularly in times of market distress and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code bad data misuse of data or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the models designall models have certain limitations reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect missing or misleading information in addition our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable also information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleadingbanking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate including distributions to our shareholders could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient6 we rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure we rely on thirdparty service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice provide enhanced products and services and reduce costs although there are benefits in entering into thirdparty relationships with vendors and others there are risks associated with such activities when entering a thirdparty relationship the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the thirdparty but remain our responsibility the technology committee of the board of directors provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with thirdparty relationships management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing thirdparty relationships management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships increased risk could occur based on poor planning oversight and control and inferior performance or service on the part of the thirdparty and may result in legal costs or loss of business while we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of thirdparty service providers any problems caused by thirdparty service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business replacing a thirdparty service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses7 changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operationsthe fasb regulatory agencies and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements additionally those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations the fasb is currently close to issuing several new accounting standards that will have significant impacts on the banking industry most notably new guidance on the calculation of credit reserves using expected losses current expected credit losses versus incurred losses is close to being finalized and upon implementation could 23table of contentssignificantly impact our required credit reserves other impacts to capital levels profit and loss and various financial metrics will also resultcompliance risks1 bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity including the annual ccar assessment process and the basel iii capital and liquidity standards could require higher levels of capital and liquidity among other things these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends repurchase common stock attract costeffective sources of deposits or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securitiesthe federal reserve administers the annual ccar an assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies with consolidated assets of 50 billion or more and of the practices used by covered banks to assess capital needs under ccar the federal reserve makes a qualitative assessment of capital adequacy on a forwardlooking basis and reviews the strength of a bank holding companys capital adequacy process the federal reserve also makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisoryrun stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a cet1 ratio of 45 after making all capital actions included in a bank holding companys capital plan under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a ninequarter planning horizon capital plans for 2016 are required to be submitted by april 5 2016 and the federal reserve will either object to the capital plan andor planned capital actions or provide a notice of nonobjection no later than june 30 2016 we intend to submit our capital plan to the federal reserve on or before april 5 2016 the bank also must submit a capital plan to the occ on or before april 5 2016 there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will respond favorably to our capital plan capital actions or stress test and the federal reserve occ or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including common stock dividends and stock repurchasesin 2013 the federal reserve and the occ adopted final rules to implement the basel iii capital rules for us banking organizations the final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the united states the basel iii regulatory capital reforms from the basel committee on banking supervision and certain changes required by the doddfrank act under the final rule minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations as a standardized approach institution the basel iii minimum capital requirements became effective for us on january 1 2015 and will be fully phasedin on january 1 2019on september 3 2014 the us banking regulators approved a final rule to implement a minimum liquidity coverage ratio lcr requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more and a less stringent modified lcr requirement to depository institution holding companies below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the lcr requires covered banking organizations to maintain hqla equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendarday stress scenario we are covered by the modified lcr requirement and therefore subject to the phasein of the rule beginning january 2016 at 90 and january 2017 at 100 we will also be required to calculate the lcr monthly the lcr assigns less severe outflow assumptions to certain types of customer deposits which should increase the demand and perhaps the cost among banks for these deposits additionally the hqla requirements will increase the demand for direct us government and us government guaranteed debt that while high quality generally carry lower yields than other securities that banks hold in their investment portfolios2 if our regulators deem it appropriate they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results ability to compete for new business or preclude mergers or acquisitions in addition regulatory actions could constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends any of these actions could increase the cost of our services we are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators including the occ federal reserve fdic sec cfpb financial industry regulatory authority and various state regulatory agencies as such we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations many of which are discussed in the regulatory matters section as part of their supervisory process which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways including charging monetary fines impacting our ability to pay dividends precluding mergers or acquisitions limiting our ability to offer certain products or services or imposing additional capital requirementswith the addition of the cfpb our consumer products and services are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations we may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations enforcement actions and litigation in the future related to consumer practices thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions in addition increased regulatory inquiries and investigations as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments could result in significant loss of revenue require remuneration to our customers trigger fines or penalties limit the products or services we offer require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products impose additional compliance costs on us cause harm to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses24table of contents3 legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs adding

our business compliance with these new laws and regulations have and will continue to result in additional costs which could be significant and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations in addition if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to our consumer operations we may be subject to fines penalties or judgments or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses which could adversely affect operations and in turn financial results4 we may become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and activity restrictions if the federal reserve and fdic determine that our resolution plan is not credible the doddfrank act and implementing regulations jointly issued by federal reserve and the fdic require bank holding companies with more than 50 billion in assets to annually submit a resolution plan to the federal reserve and the fdic that in the event of material financial distress or failure establish the rapid orderly resolution of the company under the us bankruptcy code if the federal reserve and the fdic jointly determine that our 2015 resolution plan is not credible we could become subjected to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions or restrictions on our growth activities or operations and could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations in ways that could negatively impact its operations and strategy 5 our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our financial holding company statusin order for us to maintain our status as a financial holding company we and the bank must remain well capitalized and well managed if we or our bank cease to meet the requirements necessary for us to continue to qualify as a financial holding company the federal reserve may impose upon us corrective capital and managerial requirements and may place limitations on our ability to conduct all of the business activities that we conduct as a financial holding company if the failure to meet these standards persists we could be required to divest our bank or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies in addition our ability to commence or engage in certain activities as a financial

volatility based on the absolute low level of problem loans acl as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 133 from 140 a year ago while the acl as a percentage of periodend total nals decreased to 180 from 222 management believes the level of the acl is appropriate given the current composition of the overall loan and lease portfolio noninterest income was 10 billion in 2015 an increase of 60 million or 6 compared with 2014 this reflected an increase in cards and payment processing income mortgage banking income and gain on sale of loans cards and payment processing income increased due to higher card related income and underlying customer growth the increase in mortgage banking income was primarily driven by a 33 million or 58 increase in origination and secondary marketing revenue gain on sale of loans increased due to an automobile loan securitization during 2015 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in securities gains and trust services in 2014 we adjusted the mix of our securities portfolio to prepare for the lcr requirements which resulted in securities gains the decrease in trust services primarily related to our fiduciary trust businesses moving to a more open architecture platform and a decline in assets under management in proprietary mutual funds during the 2015 fourth quarter huntington sold haa hasi and unified noninterest expense was 20 billion in 2015 an increase of 94 million or 5 compared with 2014 this reflected an increase in personnel costs other expense and outside data processing and other services personnel costs increased primarily due to an increase in salaries related to annual merit increases the addition of huntington technology finance and a 3 increase in the number of average fulltime equivalent employees largely related to the buildout of the instore strategy other noninterest expense increased due to an increase in operating lease expense related to huntington technology finance outside data processing and other services increased primarily reflecting higher debit and credit card processing costs and increased other technology investment expense as we continue to invest in technology supporting our products services and our continuous improvement initiatives these increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangibles reflecting the full

outstanding diluted common shares3aftertaxnet interest income  average balance sheetour primary source of revenue is net interest income which is the difference between interest income from earning assets primarily loans securities and direct financing leases and interest expense of funding sources primarily interestbearing deposits and borrowings earning asset balances and related funding sources as well as changes in the levels of interest rates impact net interest income the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interestbearing liabilities is the net interest spread noninterestbearing sources of funds such as demand deposits and shareholders equity also support earning assets the impact of the noninterestbearing sources of funds often referred to as free funds is captured in the net interest margin which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a fullytaxable equivalent basis which means that taxfree interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income assuming a 35 tax ratethe following table shows changes

section included in item 1a and the regulatory matters section of item 1 of this form 10ksome of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit market liquidity operational and compliance risks are described in the following paragraphscredit riskcredit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending we also have credit risk associated with our afs and htm securities portfolios see note 4 and note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management mortgage banking and trading activities while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity we believe this exposure is minimalwe continue to focus on the identification monitoring and managing of our credit risk in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes market risk management activities and portfolio diversification we use quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources enhanced use of modeling technology and internal stress testing processes our portfolio management resources demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile in our efforts to continue to identify risk mitigation techniques we have focused on product design features origination policies and solutions for delinquent or stressed borrowers the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers all authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type geography industry and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives although we offer a broad set of products we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk portfolio profilethe checks and balances in the credit process and the separation of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and provide for effective problem asset management and resolution for example we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage positionour asset quality indicators reflected overall stabilization of our credit quality performance in 2015 compared to 2014loan and lease credit exposure mixat december 31 2015 our loans and leases totaled 503 billion representing a 27 billion or 6 increase compared to 477 billion at december 31 2014 there was continued growth in the campi portfolio primarily as a result of an increase in equipment leases of 08 billion related to the acquisition of huntington technology finance in addition the automobile portfolio increased by 43table of contents08 billion as a result of strong originations the cre portfolio had modest growth over the period as the continued runoff of the noncore portfolio was more than offset by new production within the requirements associated with our internal concentration limits total commercial loans and leases were 258 billion at december 31 2015 and represented 51 of our total loan and lease credit exposure our commercial loan portfolio is diversified along product type customer size and geography within our footprint and is comprised of the following see commercial credit discussioncampi  campi loans and leases are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs equipment purchases or other projects the majority of these borrowers are customers doing business within our geographic regions campi loans and leases are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company andor the personal guarantee of the business owners the financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a campi loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral this treatment is a result of the credit decision process which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt the operation sale rental or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans as we have expanded our campi portfolio we have developed a series of vertical specialties to ensure that new products or lending types are embedded within a structured centralized commercial lending area with designated experienced credit officers these specialties are comprised of either targeted industries for example healthcare food amp agribusiness energy etc andor lending disciplines equipment finance abl etc all of which requires a high degree of expertise and oversight to effectively mitigate and monitor risk as such we have dedicated colleagues and teams focused on bringing value added expertise to these specialty clients cre  cre loans consist of loans to developers and reits supporting incomeproducing or forsale commercial real estate properties we mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement these loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings office and industrial buildings and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation sale or refinance of the propertyconstruction cre  construction cre loans are loans to developers companies or individuals used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property our construction cre portfolio primarily consists of retail multi family office and warehouse project types generally these loans are for construction projects that have been presold or preleased or have secured permanent financing as well as loans to real estate companies with significant equity invested in each project these loans are underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate lending group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction scheduletotal consumer loans and leases were 245 billion at december 31 2015 and represented 49 of our total loan and lease credit exposure the consumer portfolio is comprised primarily of automobile loans home equity loans and linesofcredit and residential mortgages see consumer credit discussion the increase from december 31 2014 primarily relates to growth in the automobile portfolioautomobile  automobile loans are comprised primarily of loans made through automotive dealerships and include exposure in selected states outside of our primary banking markets

system that applies consistent policies and processes across the portfoliohome equity  home equity lending includes both home equity loans and linesofcredit this type of lending which is secured by a firstlien or juniorlien on the borrowers residence allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home or refinance existing mortgage debt products include closedend loans which are generally fixedrate with principal and interest payments and variablerate interestonly linesofcredit which do not require payment of principal during the 10year revolving period the home equity line of credit may convert to a 20year amortizing structure at the end of the revolving period applications are underwritten centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system the home equity underwriting criteria is based on minimum credit scores debttoincome ratios and ltv ratios with current collateral valuations the underwriting for the floating rate lines of credit also incorporates a stress analysis for a rising interest rateresidential mortgage  residential mortgage loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence these loans are generally financed over a 15year to 30year term and in most cases are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence applications are underwritten centrally using consistent credit policies and processes all

guidance there were no commercial loans outstanding that would be considered a concentration of lending to a particular industry or group of industriesour loan portfolio is diversified by consumer and commercial credit at the corporate level we manage the credit exposure in part via a credit concentration policy the policy designates specific loan types collateral types and loan structures to be formally tracked and assigned limits as a percentage of capital campi lending by naics categories specific limits for cre primary project types loans secured by residential real estate shared national credit exposure and designated high risk loan definitions represent examples of specifically tracked components of our concentration management process currently there are no identified concentrations

primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower assessment of the borrowers management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process we utilize a centralized preview and senior loan approval committee led by our chief credit officer the risk rating see next paragraph and complexity of the credit determines the threshold for approval of the senior loan committee with a minimum credit exposure of 100 million for loans not requiring senior loan committee approval with the exception of small business loans credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority for small business loans we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures in this centralized decision environment certain individuals who understand each local region may make creditextension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities in which we operate in addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval processin commercial lending ongoing credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan we monitor all significant exposures on an ongoing basis all commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrowers pd and lgd this twodimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process the pd is rated and applied at the borrower level the lgd is rated and applied based on the specific type of credit extension and the quality and lien position associated with the underlying collateral the internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each periodic monitoring event there is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an ongoing basis we continually review and adjust our riskrating criteria based on actual experience which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate allowance for credit losses acl amount for the commercial portfolio a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio including small business loans to provide consistent oversightin addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and risk of new loan originations this group is part of our risk management area and conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans validate risk ratings and test the consistency of credit processesour standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment one of which is guarantor support on an annual basis or more frequently if warranted we consider among other things the guarantors reputation and creditworthiness along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth assuming 46table of contentssuch information is available our assessment of the guarantors credit strength or lack thereof is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans which is directly tied to and an integral component of our acl methodology when a loan goes to impaired status viable guarantor support is considered in the determination of a credit lossif our assessment of the guarantors credit strength yields an inherent capacity to perform we will seek repayment from the guarantor as part of the collection process and have done so successfully substantially all loans categorized as classified see note 3 of notes to consolidated

collectability of the classified loan portfoliocampi portfoliothe campi portfolio is comprised of loans to businesses where the source of repayment is associated with the ongoing operations of the business generally the loans are secured by the borrowers assets such as equipment accounts receivable andor inventory in many cases the loans are secured by real estate although the operation sale or refinancing of the real estate is not a primary source of repayment for the loan for loans secured by real estate appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirementswe manage the risks inherent in the campi portfolio through origination policies a defined loan concentration policy with established limits ongoing loan level reviews and portfolio level reviews recourse requirements and continuous portfolio risk management activities our origination policies for the campi portfolio include loan producttype specific policies such as ltv and debt service coverage ratios as applicable currently a higherrisk segment of the campi portfolio is loans to borrowers supporting oil and gas exploration and production and is further described below the campi portfolio continues to have solid origination activity as evidenced by its growth over the past 12 months and we maintain a focus on high quality originations problem loans had trended downward over the last several years reflecting a combination of proactive risk identification and effective workout strategies implemented by the sad however over the past year campi problem loans began to increase primarily as a result of the oil and gas exploration and production customers and the increase in overall portfolio size we continue to maintain a proactive approach to identifying borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty in order to maximize the potential solutions subsequent to the origination of the loan the credit review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new loan originationswe have a dedicated energy lending group that focuses on upstream companies exploration and production or eampp firms as well as midstream pipeline transportation companies this lending group is comprised of colleagues with many years of experience in this area of specialized lending through several economic cycles the exposure to the eampp companies is centered in broadly syndicated reservebased loans and is 05 of our total loans all of these loans are secured and in a firstlien position the customer base consists of larger firms that generally have had access to the capital markets andor are backed by private equity firms this lending group has no exposure to oil field services companies however we have a few legacy oil field services customers for which the remaining aggregate credit exposure is negligiblethe significant reduction in oil and gas prices over the past year has had a negative impact on the energy industry particularly exploration and production companies as well as the oil field services providers the impact of low prices for an extended period of time has had some level of adverse impact on most if not all borrowers in this segment most of these borrowers have therefore had recent downward adjustments to their risk ratings which has increased our loan loss reserve we have other energy related exposures including gas stations wholesale distributors mining and utilities we continue to monitor these exposures closely however these exposures have different factors affecting their performance and we have not seen the same level of volatility in performance or risk rating migration  cre portfoliowe manage the risks inherent in this portfolio specific to cre lending focusing on the quality of the developer and the specifics associated with each project generally we 1 limit our loans to 80 of the appraised value of the commercial real estate at origination 2 require net operating cash flows to be 125 of required interest and principal payments and 3 if the commercial real estate is nonowner occupied require that at least 50 of the space of the project be preleased we actively monitor both geographic and projecttype concentrations and performance metrics of all cre loan types with a focus on loans identified as higher risk based on the risk rating methodology both macrolevel and loanlevel stresstest scenarios based on existing and forecast market conditions are part of the ongoing portfolio management process for the cre portfolio47table of contentsdedicated real estate professionals originate and manage the portfolio the portfolio is diversified by project type and loan size and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio subsequent to the origination of the loan the credit review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new loan originationsappraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals and on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements and to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the ongoing management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions appraisals are obtained from approved vendors and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process we continue to perform ongoing portfolio level reviews within the cre portfolio these reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the projects being reviewed this highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers as well as an indepth knowledge of cre project lending and the market environmentconsumer creditconsumer credit approvals are based on among other factors the financial strength and payment history of the borrower type of exposure and transaction structure consumer credit decisions are generally made in a centralized environment utilizing decision models importantly certain individuals who understand each local region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our focus on the local communities in which we operate each credit extension is assigned a specific pd and lgd the pd is generally based on the borrowers most recent credit bureau score fico which we update quarterly providing an ongoing view of the borrowers pd the lgd is related to the type of collateral associated with the credit extension which typically does not change over the course of the loan term this allows huntington to maintain a current view of the customer for credit risk management and acl purposes in consumer lending credit risk is managed from a segment ie loan type collateral position geography etc and vintage performance analysis all portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators we make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio which may result in changes to future origination strategies the ongoing analysis and review process results in a determination of an appropriate alll

tdrs transferred from loans to loans held for sale at september 30 2015our strategy is to structure tdrs in a manner that avoids new concessions subsequent to the initial tdr terms however there are times when subsequent modifications are required such as when the modified loan matures often the loans are performing in accordance with the tdr terms and a new note is originated with similar modified terms these loans are subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing if the loan is not performing in accordance with the existing tdr terms typically an individualized approach to repayment is established in accordance with asc 3102035 the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan a new loan is considered for removal of the tdr designation a continuation of the prior note requires the continuation of the tdr designation and because the refinanced note constitutes a new or amended debt instrument it is included in our tdr activity table below as a new tdr and a restructured tdr removal during the periodthe types of concessions granted are consistent with those granted on new tdrs and include interest rate reductions amortization or maturity date changes beyond what the collateral supports and principal forgiveness based on the borrowers specific 52table of contentsneeds at a point in time our policy does not limit the number of times a loan may be modified a loan may be modified multiple times if it is considered to be in the best interest of both the borrower and huntingtoncommercial loans are not automatically considered to be accruing tdrs upon the granting of a new concession if the loan is in accruing status and no loss is expected based on the modified terms the modified tdr remains in accruing status for loans that are on nonaccrual status before the modification collection of both principal and interest must not be in doubt and the borrower must be able to exhibit sufficient cash flows for at least a sixmonth period of time to service the debt in order to return to accruing status this sixmonth period could extend before or after the restructure dateany granted change in terms or conditions that are not readily available in the market for that borrower requires the designation as a tdr there are no provisions for the removal of the tdr designation based on payment activity for consumer loans a loan may be returned to accrual status when all contractually due interest and principal has

committee is responsible for developing the methodology assumptions and estimates used in the calculation as well as determining the appropriateness of the acl the alll represents the estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reported date additions to the alll result from recording provision expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting from loan riskrating downgrades while reductions reflect chargeoffs net of recoveries decreased risk levels resulting from loan riskrating upgrades or the sale of loans the aulc is determined by applying the same quantitative reserve determination process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectationduring the 2015 first quarter we reviewed our existing commercial and consumer credit models and enhanced certain processes and methods of acl estimation during this review we updated our analysis of the loss emergence periods used for consumer receivables collectively evaluated for impairment and as a result extended our loss emergence periods for products within these portfolios as part of these enhancements to our credit reserve process we also evaluated the methods used to separately estimate economic risks inherent in our portfolios and decided to no longer utilize these separate estimation techniques rather we now incorporate economic risks in our loss estimates as a component of our reserve calculation the enhancements made to our credit reserve processes during the 2015 first quarter allow for increased segmentation and analysis of the estimated incurred losses within our loan portfolios the net acl impact of these enhancements was immaterial53table of contentsduring the 2015 third quarter we reviewed our existing commercial

consumer home equity and residential mortgage portfolios based on more recently observed portfolio experience the net acl impact of these enhancements was immaterialwe regularly evaluate the appropriateness of the acl by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above additional factors considered include the impact of increasing or decreasing residential real estate values the diversification of cre loans the development of new or expanded commercial business verticals such as healthcare abl and energy a provision for credit

is helpful to understand the process of how commercial loans are treated as they deteriorate over time the alll established is consistent with the level of risk associated with the original underwriting as a part of our normal portfolio management process for commercial loans the loan is periodically reviewed and the alll is increased or decreased based on the updated risk rating in certain cases the standard alll is determined to not be appropriate and a specific reserve is established based on the projected cash flow or collateral value of the specific loan chargeoffs if necessary are generally recognized in a period after the specific alll was established if the previously established alll exceeds that necessary to satisfactorily resolve the problem loan a reduction in the overall level of the alll could be recognized consumer loans are treated in much the same manner as commercial loans with increasing reserve factors applied based on the risk characteristics of the loan although specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans in summary if loan quality deteriorates the typical credit sequence would be periods of reserve building followed by periods of higher ncos as the previously established alll is utilized additionally an increase in the alll either precedes or is in conjunction with increases in nals when a loan is classified as nal it is evaluated for specific alll or chargeoff as a result an increase in nals does not necessarily result in an increase in the alll or an expectation of higher future ncosall residential mortgage loans greater than 150days past due are chargeddown to the estimated value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs the remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed or the loan goes through the foreclosure process for the home equity portfolio all of the defaults represent full chargeoffs as there is no remaining equity creating a lower delinquency rate

changes in market values of assets and liabilities we incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads we have identified two primary sources of market risk interest rate risk and price riskinterest rate riskoverviewhuntington actively manages interest rate risk as changes in market interest rates can have a significant impact on reported earnings the interest rate risk process is designed to compare income simulations under different market scenarios designed to alter the direction magnitude and speed of interest rate changes as well as the slope of the yield curve these scenarios are designed to illustrate the embedded optionality in the balance sheet from among other things faster or slower mortgage and mortgage backed securities prepayments and changes in funding mixincome simulation and economic value analysisinterest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the alco monthly and roc at least quarterly the information reported includes periodend results and identifies any policy limits exceeded along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the

note 6 of notes to the consolidated financial statementsat december 31 2015 we had a total of 161 million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service 162 billion in mortgage loans of this 161 million 18 million was recorded using the fair value method and 143 million was recorded using the amortization methodmsr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be reduced by prepayments prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise we have employed strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment however volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges we report msr fair value adjustments net of hedgerelated trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking incomemsrs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with

renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly shortterm variablerate nature see note 20 for more informationinterest rate swapsbalance sheet hedging activity is arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment and is classified as either fair value or cash

internal systems processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any material lossesour objective for managing cyber security risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems we work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack and by diligently managing visibility

implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks we also use thirdparty services to test the effectiveness of our cyber security risk management framework and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentialityto mitigate operational risks we have a senior management operational risk committee and a senior management legal regulatory and compliance committee the responsibilities of these committees among other duties include establishing and maintaining management information

business banking commercial banking automobile finance and commercial real estate afcre regional banking and the huntington private client group rbhpcg and home lending a treasury  other function includes technology and operations other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expense business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutionsrevenue sharingrevenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocationsexpense allocationthe management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all five business segments from treasury  other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury  other expenses except reported significant items and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the five business segmentsfunds transfer pricing ftp71table of contentswe use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury  other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury  other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market

understanding huntingtons results of operations or financial position where nongaap financial measures are used the comparable gaap financial measure as well as the reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure can be found herein significant itemsfrom timetotime revenue expenses or taxes are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities andor by items that while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or shortterm in nature we refer to such items as significant items most often these significant items result from factors originating outside the company eg regulatory actions  assessments windfall gains changes in accounting principles onetime tax assessments  refunds litigation actions etc in other cases they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business eg merger  restructuring charges recapitalization actions goodwill impairment etceven though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions as a general rule volatility alone does not define a significant item for example changes in the provision for credit losses gains  losses from investment activities asset valuation writedowns etc reflect ordinary banking activities and are therefore typically excluded from consideration as a significant itemwe believe the disclosure of significant items provides a better understanding of our performance and trends to ascertain which of such items if any to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance ie within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations as well as how if at all to adjust estimates of future performance accordingly to this end we adopted a practice of listing significant items in our external disclosure documents eg earnings press releases investor presentations forms 10q and 10ksignificant items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performancefullytaxable equivalent basisinterest income yields and ratios on a fte basis are considered nongaap financial measures management believes net interest income on a fte basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes the fte basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and taxexempt sources the fte basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent we encourage readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other

regulators the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy includingtangible common equity to tangible assetstier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets using basel i definitions andtangible common equity to riskweighted assets using basel i and basel iii definitions90table of contentsthese nonregulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the companys capitalization to other financial services companies these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies these ratios are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap or federal banking regulations as a result these nonregulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company are considered nongaap financial measuresbecause there are no standardized definitions for these nonregulatory capital ratios the companys calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies also there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors as a result the company encourages

the risk management and capital discussion as well as the regulatory matters section included in item 1 and incorporated by reference into the mdampacritical accounting policies and use of significant estimatesour consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference into this mdampa describes the significant accounting policies we use in our consolidated financial statementsan accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed belowallowance for credit lossesour acl of 07 billion at december 31 2015 represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risk associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsvaluation of financial instrumentsassets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility assets measured at fair value include certain loans held for sale loans held for investment availableforsale and trading securities certain securitized automobile loans msrs derivatives and certain shortterm borrowings at december 31 2015 approximately 91 billion of our assets and 01 billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in addition to the above mentioned ongoing fair value measurements fair value is also used for recording business combinations and measuring other nonrecurring financial assets and liabilities at the end of each quarter we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured at fair value as necessary assets or liabilities may be transferred within fair value hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement datewhere available we use quoted market prices to determine fair value if quoted market prices are not available fair value is determined using either internally developed or independent thirdparty valuation models based on inputs that are either directly observable or derived from market data these inputs include but are not limited to interest rate yield curves option volatilities or option adjusted spreads where neither quoted market prices nor observable market data are available fair value is determined using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on managements expectation that market participants 91table of contentswould use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability the determination of appropriate unobservable inputs requires exercise of significant judgment a significant portion of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value are measured based on quoted market prices or observable market independent inputsthe following is a description of the significant estimates used in the valuation of financial assets and liabilities for which quoted market prices and observable market parameters are not availablemunicipal and assetbacked securitiesthe municipal securities portion that is classified as level 3 uses significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the fair value is determined by utilizing thirdparty valuation services the thirdparty service provider reviews credit worthiness prevailing market rates analysis of similar securities and projected cash flows the thirdparty service provider also incorporates industry and general economic conditions into their analysis huntington evaluates the analysis provided for reasonablenessour private label cmo and cdo preferred securities portfolios are measured at fair value using a valuation methodology involving use of significant unobservable inputs and are thus classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy the private label cmo securities portfolio is subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows while the cash flows of our cdo preferred securities portfolio is reviewed quarterly these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties and are used as a basis for impairment analysisalta mortgagebacked and privatelabel cmo securities are collateralized by firstlien residential mortgage loans the securities valuation methodology incorporates values obtained from a thirdparty pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and a proprietary pricing model and includes assumptions management believes market participants would use to value the securities under current market conditions the model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds losses recoveries default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures house price depreciation  appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts and discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities with similar collateral structurescdo preferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio we engage a thirdparty pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooledtrustpreferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio the pd of each issuer and the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value management evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the thirdparty pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter actual defaults and deferrals in the current period and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with asc 820derivatives used for hedging purposesderivatives designated as qualified hedges are tested for hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis assessments are made at the inception of the hedge and on a recurring basis to determine whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item a statistical regression analysis is performed to measure the effectivenessif based on the assessment a derivative is not expected to be a highly effective hedge or it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge hedge accounting is discontinued as of the quarter the hedge is not highly effective as the statistical regression analysis requires the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are sensitive to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates we consider this a critical accounting estimateloans held for salehuntington has elected to apply the fair value option to certain residential mortgage loans that are classified as held for sale at origination the fair value of such loans is estimated based on the inputs that include prices of mortgage backed securities adjusted for other variables such as interest rates expected credit defaults and market discount rates the adjusted value reflects the price we expect to receive from the sale of such loanscertain consumer and commercial loans are classified as held for sale and are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value the determination of fair value for these consumer loans is based on observable prices for similar products or discounted expected cash flows which takes into consideration factors such as future interest rates prepayment speeds default and loss curves and market discount rates 92table of contentsmortgage servicing rightsretained rights to service mortgage loans are recognized as a separate and distinct asset at the time the loans are sold mortgage servicing rights msrs are initially recorded at fair value at the time the related loans are sold and subsequently remeasured at each reporting date under either the fair value or amortization method the election of the fair value or amortization method is made at the time each servicing asset is established all newly created msrs since 2009 are recorded using the amortization method any increase or decrease in fair value of msrs accounted for under the fair value method as well as any amortization andor impairment of msrs recorded under the amortization method is reflected in earnings in the period that the changes occur msrs are subject to interest rate risk in that their fair value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment fair value is determined based upon the application of an income approach valuation model we use an independent thirdparty valuation model which incorporates assumptions in estimating future cash flows these assumptions include prepayment speeds payoffs and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions the reasonableness of these pricing models is validated on a minimum of a quarterly basis by at least one independent external service broker valuation because the fair values of msrs are significantly impacted by the use of estimates the use of different assumptions can result in different estimated fair values of those msrscontingent liabilitieswe are a party to various claims litigation and legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current andor former operations we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a casebycase basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering among other factors the progress of each case or proceeding our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings and the opinions and views of legal counsel litigation exposure represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our controlincome taxesthe calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments we have two accruals for income taxes 1 our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal state and local taxing jurisdictions net of any reserve for potential audit issues and any tax refunds and the net receivable balance is reported as a component of accrued income and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 2 our deferred federal and state income tax and related valuation accounts reported as a component of accrued income and other assets represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under gaap and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under federal and state tax lawin the ordinary course of business we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes the effective tax

positions and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance such changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position andor results of operations see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statementsdeferred tax assetsat december 31 2015 we had a net federal deferred tax asset of 7 million and a net state deferred tax asset of 43 million a valuation allowance is provided when it is morelikelythannot some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized all available evidence both positive and negative was considered to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence impairment should be recognized our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change if our forecast of taxable income within the carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets such assets may be impaired based on our analysis of both positive and negative evidence and our ability to offset the net deferred tax assets against our forecasted future taxable income there was no impairment of the

services are available through the headquarters office in columbus ohio and a limited purpose office located in the cayman islandsbasis of presentation  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of huntington and its majorityowned subsidiaries and are presented in accordance with gaap all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation companies in which huntington holds more than a 50 voting equity interest or a controlling financial interest or are a vie in which huntington has the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie which could potentially be significant to the vie are consolidated vies are legal entities with insubstantial equity whose equity investors lack the ability to make decisions about the entitys activities or whose equity investors do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity if they occur vies in which huntington does not hold the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance or does not have an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie which could potentially be significant to the vie are not consolidated for consolidated entities where huntington holds less than a 100 interest huntington recognizes noncontrolling interest included in shareholders equity for the equity held by others and noncontrolling profit or loss included in noninterest expense for the portion of the entitys earnings attributable to others interests investments in companies that are not consolidated are accounted for using the equity method when huntington has the ability to exert significant influence those investments in nonmarketable securities for which huntington does not have the ability to exert significant influence are generally accounted for using the cost method investments in private investment partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method or the cost method are included in accrued income and other assets and huntingtons proportional interest in the equity investments earnings are included in other noninterest income investment interests accounted for under the cost and equity methods are periodically evaluated for impairmentthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that significantly affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements huntington utilizes processes that involve the use of significant estimates and the judgments of management in determining the amount of its allowance for credit losses income taxes deferred tax assets and contingent liabilities as well as fair value measurements of investment securities derivatives goodwill pension assets and liabilities shortterm borrowings mortgage servicing rights and loans held for sale as with any estimate actual results could differ from those estimates for statement of cash flows purposes cash and cash equivalents are defined as the sum of cash and due from banks which includes amounts on deposit with the federal reserve and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreementscertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentationresale and repurchase agreements  securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest the fair value of collateral either received from or provided to a thirdparty is continually monitored and additional collateral is obtained or requested to be returned to huntington in accordance with the agreementsecurities  securities purchased with the intention of recognizing shortterm profits or which are actively bought and sold are classified as trading account securities and reported at fair value the unrealized gains or losses on trading account securities are recorded in other noninterest income except for gains and losses on trading account securities used to hedge the fair value of msrs which are included in mortgage banking income debt securities purchased in which huntington has the positive intent and ability to hold to their maturity are classified as heldtomaturity securities heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost all other debt and equity securities are classified as availableforsale and other securities unrealized gains or losses on availableforsale and other securities are reported as a separate component of accumulated oci in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders equity creditrelated declines in the value of debt securities that are considered otherthantemporary are recorded in noninterest incomehuntington evaluates its investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis for indicators of otti huntington assesses whether otti has occurred when the fair value of a debt security is less than the amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date management reviews the amount of unrealized loss the length of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position the credit rating history market trends of similar security classes time remaining to maturity and the source of both interest and principal payments to identify securities which could potentially be impaired otti is considered to have occurred 1 if huntington intends to sell the security 2 if it is more likely than not huntington will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 the present value of expected cash flows are not sufficient to recover all contractually required principal and interest payments for securities that huntington does not expect to sell or it is not more likely than not to be required to sell the otti is separated into credit and noncredit components a discounted cash flow analysis which includes evaluating the timing of the expected cash flows is completed for all debt securities subject to credit impairment the measurement of the credit loss component is equal to the difference between the debt securitys cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows discounted at the securitys effective yield the creditrelated otti represented by the expected loss in principal is recognized in noninterest income the remaining difference between the securitys fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not creditrelated and therefore are recognized in oci huntington believes that it will fully collect the carrying value of securities on which noncreditrelated otti has been recognized in oci noncreditrelated otti results from other factors including increased liquidity spreads and extension of the security for securities which huntington does expect to sell or if it is more likely than not huntington will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis all otti is recognized in earnings presentation of otti is made in the consolidated statements of income on a gross basis with a reduction for the amount of otti recognized in oci securities transactions are recognized on the trade date the date the order to buy or sell is executed the carrying value plus any related accumulated oci balance of sold securities is used to compute realized gains and losses interest and dividends on securities including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the effective interest method over the period to maturity are included in interest incomenonmarketable equity securities include stock acquired for regulatory purposes such as federal home loan bank stock and federal reserve bank stock these securities are accounted for at cost evaluated for impairment and included in availableforsale and other securities loans and leases  loans and direct financing leases for which huntington has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as loans and leases except for loans for which the fair value option has been elected loans and leases are carried at the principal amount outstanding net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs and net of unearned income direct financing leases are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values net of unearned and deferred income interest income is accrued as earned using the interest method based on unpaid principal balances huntington defers the fees it receives from the origination of loans and leases as well as the direct costs of those activities huntington also acquires loans at a premium and at a discount to their contractual values huntington amortizes loan discounts premiums and net loan origination fees and costs on a levelyield basis over the estimated lives of the related loans which would not include purchased credit impaired loanstroubled debt restructurings are loans for which the original contractual terms have been modified to provide a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties loan modifications are considered tdrs when the concessions provided are not available to the borrower through either normal channels or other sources however not all loan modifications are tdrs modifications resulting in troubled debt restructurings may include changes to one or more terms of the loan including but not limited to a change in interest rate an extension of the amortization period a reduction in payment amount and partial forgiveness or deferment of principal or accrued interestresidual values on leased equipment are evaluated quarterly for impairment impairment of the residual values of direct financing leases determined to be other than temporary is recognized by writing the leases down to fair value with a charge to other noninterest expense residual value losses arise if the expected fair value at the end of the lease term is less than the residual value recorded at the lease origination net of estimated amounts reimbursable by the lessee future declines in the expected residual value of the leased equipment would result in expected losses of the leased equipmentfor leased equipment the residual component of a direct financing lease represents the estimated fair value of the leased equipment at the end of the lease term huntington uses industry data historical experience and independent appraisals to establish these residual value estimates additional information regarding product life cycle product upgrades as well as insight into competing products are obtained through relationships with industry contacts and are factored into residual value estimates where applicableloans held for sale  loans in which huntington does not have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as loans held for sale loans held for sale excluding loans originated or acquired with the intent to sell which are carried at fair value are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell the fair value option is generally elected for mortgage loans held for sale to facilitate hedging of the loans the fair value of such loans is estimated based on the inputs that include prices of mortgage backed securities adjusted for other variables such as interest rates expected credit defaults and market discount rates the adjusted value reflects the price we expect to receive from the sale of such loansnonmortgage loans held for sale are measured on an aggregate asset basis106table of contentsallowance for credit losses  huntington maintains two reserves both of which reflect managements judgment regarding the appropriate level necessary to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the alll and the aulc combined these reserves comprise the total acl the determination of the acl requires significant estimates including the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and leases consideration of current economic conditions and historical loss experience pertaining to pools of homogeneous loans and leases all of which may be susceptible to changethe appropriateness of the acl is based on managements current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio these judgments consider ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support further management evaluates the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above additional factors also considered include the impact of increasing or decreasing residential real estate values the diversification of cre loans the development of new or expanded commercial business segments such as healthcare abl leveraged lending and energy and the overall condition of the manufacturing industry also the acl assessment includes the ongoing assessment of credit quality metrics and a comparison of certain acl benchmarks to current performance the alll consists of two components 1 the transaction reserve which includes a loan level allocation specific reserves related to loans considered to be impaired and loans involved in troubled debt restructurings and 2 the general reserve the transaction reserve component includes both 1 an estimate of loss based on pools of commercial and consumer loans and leases with similar characteristics and 2 an estimate of loss based on an impairment review of each impaired campi and cre loan where obligor balance is greater than 10 million for the campi and cre portfolios the estimate of loss based on pools of loans and leases with similar characteristics is made by applying a pd factor and a lgd factor to each individual loan based on a regularly updated loan grade using a standardized loan grading system the pd factor and an lgd factor are determined for each loan grade using statistical models based on historical performance data the pd factor considers ongoing reviews of the financial performance of the specific borrower including cash flow debtservice coverage ratio earnings power debt level and equity position in conjunction with an assessment of the borrowers industry and future prospects the lgd factor considers analysis of the type of collateral and the relative ltv ratio these reserve factors are developed based on credit migration models that track historical movements of loans between loan ratings over time and a combination of longterm average loss experience of our own portfolio and external industry datain the case of more homogeneous portfolios such as automobile loans home equity loans and residential mortgage loans the determination of the transaction reserve also incorporates pd and lgd factors the estimate of loss is based on pools of loans and leases with similar characteristics the pd factor considers current credit scores unless the account is delinquent in which case a higher pd factor is used the credit score provides a basis for understanding the borrowers past and current payment performance and this information is used to estimate expected losses over the emergence period the performance of firstlien loans ahead of our juniorlien loans is available to use as part of our updated score process the lgd factor considers analysis of the type of collateral and the relative ltv ratio credit scores models analyses and other factors used to determine both the pd and lgd factors are updated frequently to capture the recent behavioral characteristics of the subject portfolios as well as any changes in loss mitigation or credit origination strategies and adjustments to the reserve factors are made as required the general reserve consists of various riskprofile reserve components the riskprofile component considers items unique to our structure policies processes and portfolio composition as well as qualitative measurements and assessments of the loan portfolios including but not limited to management quality concentrations portfolio composition industry comparisons and internal review functionsthe estimate for the aulc is determined using the same procedures and methodologies as used for the alll the loss factors used in the aulc are the same as the loss factors used in the alll while also considering a historical utilization of unused commitments the aulc is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheetsnonaccrual and past due loans  loans are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due dateany loan in any portfolio may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to the policies described below when collection of principal or interest is in doubt when a borrower with debt is discharged in a chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower the loan is determined to be collateral dependent and placed on nonaccrual status unless there is a coborrowerall classes within the campi and cre portfolios except for purchased creditimpaired loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 90days past due firstlien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 150days past due juniorlien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of 120days past due or when the related firstlien loan has been identified as nonaccrual automobile and other consumer loans are generally chargedoff when the loan is 120days past due residential mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 150days past due with the exception of residential mortgages guaranteed by government agencies 107table of contentswhich continue to accrue interest at the rate guaranteed by the government agency we are reimbursed from the government agency for reasonable expenses incurred in servicing loans for all classes within all loan portfolios when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status any accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to interest income and prior year amounts chargedoff as a credit lossfor all classes within all loan portfolios cash receipts received on nals are applied against principal until the loan or lease has been collected in full after which time any additional cash receipts are recognized as interest income however for secured nonreaffirmed debt in a chapter 7 bankruptcy payments are applied to principal and interest when the borrower has demonstrated a capacity to continue payment of the debt and collection of the debt is reasonably assured for unsecured nonreaffirmed debt in a chapter 7 bankruptcy where the carrying value has been fully chargedoff payments are recorded as loan recoveriesregarding all classes within the campi and cre portfolios the determination of a borrowers ability to make the required principal and interest payments is based on an examination of the borrowers current financial statements industry management capabilities and other qualitative measures for all classes within the consumer loan portfolio the determination of a borrowers ability to make the required principal and interest payments is based on multiple factors including number of days past due and in some instances an evaluation of the borrowers financial condition when in managements judgment the borrowers ability to make required principal and interest payments resumes and collectability is no longer in doubt supported by sustained repayment history the loan is returned to accrual status for these loans that have been returned to accrual status cash receipts are applied according to the contractual terms of the loanchargeoff of uncollectible loans  any loan in any portfolio may be chargedoff prior to the policies described below if a loss confirming event has occurred loss confirming events include but are not limited to bankruptcy unsecured continued delinquency foreclosure or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency and that asset is the sole source of repayment additionally discharged collateral dependent nonreaffirmed debt in chapter 7 bankruptcy filings will result in a chargeoff to estimated collateral value less anticipated selling costscampi and cre loans are either chargedoff or written down to net realizable value at 90days past due automobile loans and other consumer loans are chargedoff at 120days past due firstlien and juniorlien home equity loans are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs at 150days past due and 120days past due respectively residential mortgages are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the collateral at 150days past dueimpaired loans  for all classes within the campi and cre portfolios all loans with an obligor balance of 10 million or greater are evaluated on a quarterly basis for impairment except for tdrs consumer loans within any class are generally not individually evaluated on a regular basis for impairment all tdrs regardless of the outstanding balance amount are also considered to be impaired loans acquired with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable at acquisition that all contractually required payments will not be collected are also considered to be impairedonce a loan has been identified for an assessment of impairment the loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected this determination requires significant judgment and use of estimates and the eventual outcome may differ significantly from those estimateswhen a loan in any class has been determined to be impaired the amount of the impairment is measured using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or as a practical expedient the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent when the present value of expected future cash flows is used the effective interest rate is the original contractual interest rate of the loan adjusted for any cost fee premium or discount when the contractual interest rate is variable the effective interest rate of the loan changes over time a specific reserve is established as a component of the alll when a loan has been determined to be impaired subsequent to the initial measurement of impairment if there is a significant change to the impaired loans expected future cash flows or if actual cash flows are significantly different from the cash flows previously estimated huntington recalculates the impairment and appropriately adjusts the specific reserve similarly if huntington measures impairment based on the observable market price of an impaired loan or the fair value of the collateral of an impaired collateral dependent loan huntington will adjust the specific reservewhen a loan within any class is impaired the accrual of interest income is discontinued unless the receipt of principal and interest is no longer in doubt interest income on tdrs is accrued when all principal and interest is expected to be collected under the postmodification terms cash receipts received on nonaccruing impaired loans within any class are generally applied entirely against principal until the loan has been collected in full including already chargedoff portion after which time any additional cash receipts are recognized as interest income cash receipts received on accruing impaired loans within any class are applied in the same manner as accruing loans that are not considered impaired108table of contentspurchased creditimpaired loans  purchased loans with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable at acquisition that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are considered to be credit impaired purchased creditimpaired loans are initially recorded at fair value which is estimated by discounting the cash flows expected to be collected at the acquisition date because the estimate of expected cash flows reflects an estimate of future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loans an allowance for credit losses is not recorded at the acquisition date the excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value referred to as the accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans on a levelyield basis the difference between the contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference a subsequent decrease in the estimate of cash flows expected to be received on purchased creditimpaired loans generally results in the recognition of an allowance for credit losses subsequent increases in cash flows result in reversal of any nonaccretable difference or allowance for loan and lease losses to the extent any has been recorded with a positive impact on interest income subsequently recognized the measurement of cash flows involves assumptions and judgments for interest rates prepayments default rates loss severity and collateral values all of these factors are inherently subjective and significant changes in the cash flow estimates over the life of the loan can resulttransfers of financial assets and securitizations  transfers of financial assets in which we have surrendered control over the transferred assets are accounted for as sales in assessing whether control has been surrendered we consider whether the transferee would be a consolidated affiliate the existence and extent of any continuing involvement in the transferred financial assets and the impact of all arrangements or agreements made contemporaneously with or in contemplation of the transfer even if they were not entered into at the time of transfer control is generally considered to have been surrendered when i the transferred assets have been legally isolated from us or any of our consolidated affiliates even in bankruptcy or other receivership ii the transferee or if the transferee is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization or assetbacked financing that is constrained from pledging or exchanging the assets it receives each thirdparty holder of its beneficial interests has the right to pledge or exchange the assets or beneficial interests it received without any constraints that provide more than a trivial benefit to us and iii neither we nor our consolidated affiliates and agents have a both the right and obligation under any agreement to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets before their maturity b the unilateral ability to cause the holder to return specific financial assets that also provides us with a morethantrivial benefit other than through a cleanup call or c an agreement that permits the transferee to require us to repurchase the transferred assets at a price so favorable that it is probable that it will require us to repurchase themif the sale criteria are met the transferred financial assets are removed from our balance sheet and a gain or loss on sale is recognized if the sale criteria are not met the transfer is recorded as a secured borrowing in which the assets remain on our balance sheet and the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a liability for the majority of financial asset transfers it is clear whether or not we have surrendered control for other transfers such as in connection with complex transactions or where we have continuing involvement we generally obtain a legal opinion as to whether the transfer results in a true sale by lawwe have historically securitized certain automobile receivables gains and losses on the loans and leases sold and servicing rights associated with loan and lease sales are determined when the related loans or leases are sold to either a securitization trust or thirdparty for loan or lease sales with servicing retained a servicing asset is recorded at fair value for the right to service the loans soldderivative financial instruments  a variety of derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps caps floors and collars are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements these instruments provide flexibility in adjusting huntingtons sensitivity to changes in interest rates without exposure to loss of principal and higher funding requirementshuntington also uses derivatives principally loan sale commitments in hedging its mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and its mortgage loans held for sale mortgage loan sale commitments and the related interest rate lock commitments are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking income huntington also uses certain derivative financial instruments to offset changes in value of its msrs these derivatives consist primarily of forward interest rate agreements and forward mortgage contracts the derivative instruments used are not designated as qualifying hedges accordingly such derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking incomederivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities respectively and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into we designate it as either a qualifying hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedgea qualifying hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset liability or forecasted transaction cash flow hedge ora trading instrument or a nonqualifying economic hedge109table of contentschanges in the fair value of a derivative that has been designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period earnings changes in the fair value of a derivative that has been designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge to the extent effective as a hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of income taxes and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged item affects earnings ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship is reflected in current period earnings changes in the fair value of derivatives held for trading purposes or which do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in current period earningsfor those derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied huntington formally documents the hedging relationship and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge this documentation identifies the hedging instrument the hedged item or transaction the nature of the risk being hedged and unless the hedge meets all of the criteria to assume there is no ineffectiveness the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging instrument and how ineffectiveness will be measured the methods utilized to assess retrospective hedge effectiveness as well as the frequency of testing vary based on the type of item being hedged and the designated hedge period for specifically designated fair value hedges of certain fixedrate debt huntington utilizes the shortcut method when certain criteria are met for other fair value hedges of fixedrate debt including certificates of deposit huntington utilizes the regression method to evaluate hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis for fair value hedges of portfolio loans the regression method is used to evaluate effectiveness on a daily basis for cash flow hedges the regression method is applied on a quarterly basishedge accounting is discontinued prospectively whenthe derivative is no longer effective or expected to be effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item including firm commitments or forecasted transactionsthe derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercisedit is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occurthe hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment orthe designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is removedwhen hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value or cash flow hedge the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair valuein the case of a discontinued fair value hedge of a recognized asset or liability as long as the hedged item continues to exist on the balance sheet the hedged item will no longer be adjusted for changes in fair value the basis adjustment that had previously been recorded to the hedged item during the period from the hedge designation date to the hedge discontinuation date is recognized as an adjustment to the yield of the hedged item over the remaining life of the hedged itemin the case of a discontinued cash flow hedge of a recognized asset or liability as long as the hedged item continues to exist on the balance sheet the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the hedging derivative will no longer be recorded to other comprehensive income the balance applicable to the discontinued hedging relationship will be recognized in earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item as an adjustment to yield if the discontinued hedged item was a forecasted transaction that is not expected to occur any amounts recorded on the balance sheet related to the hedged item including any amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified to current period earningsin the case of either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge if the previously hedged item is sold or extinguished the basis adjustment to the underlying asset or liability or any remaining unamortized other comprehensive income balance will be reclassified to current period earningsin all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued the derivative will be carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings unless redesignated as a qualifying hedgelike other financial instruments derivatives contain an element of credit risk which is the possibility that huntington will incur a loss because the counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations notional values of interest rate swaps and other offbalance sheet financial instruments significantly exceed the credit risk associated with these instruments and represent contractual balances on which calculations of amounts to be exchanged are based credit exposure is limited to the sum of the aggregate fair value of positions that have become favorable to huntington including any accrued interest receivable due from counterparties potential credit losses are mitigated through careful evaluation of counterparty credit standing selection of counterparties from a limited group of high quality institutions collateral agreements and other contract provisions huntington considers the value of collateral held and collateral provided in determining the net carrying value of derivativeshuntington offsets the fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and the fair value for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement110table of contentsrepossessed collateral  repossessed collateral also referred to as other real estate owned oreo is comprised principally of commercial and residential real estate properties obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations and is carried at fair value collateral obtained in satisfaction of a loan is recorded at the estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs based upon the propertys appraised value at the date of foreclosure with any difference between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of the loan recorded as a chargeoff if the fair value is higher than the carrying amount of the loan the excess is recognized first as a recovery and then as noninterest income subsequent declines in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are recorded in noninterest expense gains or losses resulting from the sale of collateral are recognized in noninterest expense at the date of salecollateral  we pledge assets as collateral as required for various transactions including security repurchase agreements public deposits loan notes derivative financial instruments shortterm borrowings and longterm borrowings assets that have been pledged as collateral including those that can be sold or repledged by the secured party continue to be reported on our consolidated balance sheetswe also accept collateral primarily as part of various transactions including derivative and security resale agreements collateral accepted by us including collateral that we can sell or repledge is excluded from our consolidated balance sheetsthe market value of collateral we have accepted or pledged is regularly monitored and additional collateral is obtained or provided as necessary to ensure appropriate collateral coverage in these transactions premises and equipment  premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is computed principally by the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets buildings and building improvements are depreciated over an average of 30 to 40 years and 10 to 30 years respectively land improvements and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over an average of 5 to 20 years while equipment is depreciated over a range of 3 to 10 years leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the assets useful life or the lease term including any renewal periods for which renewal is reasonably assured maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred while improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life premises and equipment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverablemortgage servicing rights  huntington recognizes the rights to service mortgage loans as separate assets which are included in accrued income and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets when purchased or when servicing is contractually separated from the underlying mortgage loans by sale or securitization of the loans with servicing rights retainedfor loan sales with servicing retained a servicing asset is recorded on the day of the sale at fair value for the right to service the loans sold to determine the fair value of a msr huntington uses an option adjusted spread cash flow analysis incorporating market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and market interest rates the forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for us dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments the current and projected mortgage interest rate influences the prepayment rate and therefore the timing and magnitude of the cash flows associated with the msr servicing revenues on mortgage loans are included in mortgage banking incomeat the time of initial capitalization msrs may be grouped into servicing classes based on the availability of market inputs used in determining fair value and the method used for managing the risks of the servicing assets msr assets are recorded using the fair value method or the amortization method the election of the fair value or amortization method is made at the time each servicing class is established all newly created msrs since 2009 were recorded using the amortization method any change in the fair value of msrs carried under the fair value method as well as amortization and impairment of msrs under the amortization method during the period is recorded in mortgage banking income which is reflected in the consolidated statements of income huntington economically hedges the value of certain msrs using derivative instruments and trading securities changes in fair value of these derivatives and trading securities are reported as a component of mortgage banking incomegoodwill and other intangible assets  under the acquisition method of accounting the net assets of entities acquired byhuntington are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition the excess cost of the acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill other intangible assets are amortized either on an accelerated or straightline basis over their estimated useful lives goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis at october 1st of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverablepension and other postretirement benefits  we recognize the funded status of the postretirement benefit plans on the consolidated balance sheets net postretirement benefit cost charged to current earnings related to these plans is based on various actuarial assumptions regarding expected future experiencecertain employees are participants in various defined contribution and other nonqualified supplemental retirement plans our contributions to these plans are charged to current earnings111table of contentsin addition we maintain a 401k plan covering substantially all employees employer contributions to the plan which are charged to current earnings are based on employee contributionssharebased compensation  we use the fair value based method of accounting for awards of hban stock granted to employees under various stock option and restricted share plans stock compensation costs are recognized prospectively for all new awards granted under these plans compensation expense relating to share options is calculated using a methodology that is based on the underlying assumptions of the blackscholes option pricing model and is charged to expense over the requisite service period eg vesting period compensation expense relating to restricted stock awards is based upon the fair value of the awards on the date of grant and is charged to earnings over the requisite service period eg vesting period of the awardstock repurchases  acquisitions of

periods for products within these portfolios as part of these enhancements to our credit reserve process we also evaluated the methods used to separately estimate economic risks inherent in our portfolios and decided to no longer utilize these separate estimation techniques rather we now incorporate economic risks in our loss estimates elsewhere in our reserve calculation the enhancements

weaknesses are not mitigateddoubtful  loans that have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as substandard with the added elements of the full collection of the loan is improbable

updated as appropriatecommercial loans categorized as olem substandard or doubtful are considered criticized loans commercial loans categorized as substandard or doubtful are also considered classified loansfor all classes within all consumer loan portfolios each loan is assigned a specific pd factor that is partially based on the borrowers most recent credit bureau score which we update quarterly a credit bureau score is a credit score developed by fair isaaccorporation based on data provided by the credit bureaus the credit bureau score is widely accepted as the standard measure of consumer credit risk used by lenders regulators rating agencies and consumers the higher the credit bureau score the higher likelihood of repayment and therefore an indicator of higher credit

aggregate amount of principal forgiven as a result of loans modified as tdrs during the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 was not significantfollowing is a description of tdrs by the different loan typescommercial loan tdrs  commercial accruing tdrs often result from loans receiving a concession with terms that are not considered a market transaction to huntington the tdr remains in accruing status as long as the customer is less than 90days past due on payments per the restructured loan terms and no loss is expectedcommercial nonaccrual tdrs result from either 1 an accruing commercial tdr being placed on nonaccrual status or 2 a workout where an existing commercial nal is restructured and a concession is given at times these workouts restructure the nal so that two or more new notes are created the primary note is underwritten based upon our normal underwriting standards and is sized so projected cash flows are sufficient to repay contractual principal and interest the terms on the secondary notes vary by situation and may include notes that defer principal and interest payments until after the primary note is repaid creating two or more notes often allows the borrower to continue a project and allows huntington to rightsize a loan based upon the current expectations for a borrowers or projects performanceour strategy involving tdr borrowers includes working with these borrowers to allow them to refinance elsewhere as well as allow them time to improve their financial position and remain our customer through refinancing their notes according to market terms and conditions in the future a subsequent refinancing or modification of a loan may occur when either the loan matures according to the terms of the tdrmodified agreement or the borrower requests a change to the loan agreements at that time the loan is evaluated to determine if it is creditworthy it is subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan a new loan is considered for removal of the tdr designation whereas a continuation of the prior note requires a continuation of the tdr designation in order for a tdr designation to be removed the borrower must no longer be experiencing financial difficulties and the terms of the refinanced loan must not represent a concessionresidential mortgage loan tdrs  residential mortgage tdrs represent loan modifications associated with traditional firstlien mortgage loans in which a concession has been provided to the borrower the primary concessions given to residential mortgage borrowers are amortization or maturity date changes and interest rate reductions residential mortgages identified as tdrs involve borrowers unable to refinance their mortgages through the companys normal mortgage origination channels or through other independent sources some but not all of the loans may be delinquentautomobile home equity and other consumer loan tdrs  the company may make similar interest rate term and principal concessions as with residential mortgage loan tdrstdr impact on credit qualityhuntingtons alll is largely determined by updated risk ratings assigned to commercial loans updated borrower credit scores on consumer loans and borrower delinquency history in both the commercial and consumer portfolios these updated risk ratings and credit scores consider the default history of the borrower including payment redefaults as such the provision for credit losses is impacted primarily by changes in borrower payment performance rather than the tdr classification tdrs can be classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans nonaccrual tdrs are included in nals whereas accruing tdrs are excluded from nals as it is probable that all contractual principal and interest due under the restructured terms will be collectedour tdrs may include multiple concessions and the disclosure classifications are presented based on the primary concession provided to the borrower the majority of our concessions for the campi and cre portfolios are the extension of the maturity date  but could also include an increase in the interest rate in these instances the primary concession is the maturity date extensiontdr concessions may also result in the reduction of the alll within the campi and cre portfolios this reduction is derived from payments and the resulting application of the reserve calculation within the alll the transaction reserve for nontdr campi and cre loans is calculated based upon several estimated probability factors such as pd and lgd both of which were previously discussed upon the occurrence of a tdr in our campi and cre portfolios the reserve is measured based on discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs of the modified loan in accordance with asc 31010 the resulting tdr alll calculation often results in a lower alll amount because 1 the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs indicate a lower estimated loss 2 if the modification includes a rate increase the discounting of the cash flows on the modified loan using the premodification interest rate exceeds the carrying value of the loan or 3 payments may occur as part of the modification the alll for campi and cre loans may increase as a result of the modification as the discounted cash flow analysis may indicate additional reserves are requiredtdr concessions on consumer loans may increase the alll the concessions made to these borrowers often include interest rate reductions and therefore the tdr alll calculation results in a greater alll compared with the nontdr calculation as the 128table of contentsreserve is measured based on the estimation of the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs on the modified loan in accordance with asc 31010 the resulting tdr alll calculation often results in a higher alll amount because 1 the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs indicate a higher estimated loss or 2 due to the rate decrease the discounting of the cash flows on the modified loan using the premodification interest rate indicates a reduction in the present value of expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs in certain instances the alll may decrease as a result of payments made in connection with the modificationcommercial loan tdrs  in instances where the bank substantiates that it will collect its outstanding balance in full the note is considered for return to accrual status upon the borrower showing a sustained period of repayment performance for a sixmonth period of time this sixmonth period could extend before or after the restructure date if a chargeoff was taken as part of the restructuring any interest or principal payments received on that note are applied to first reduce the banks outstanding book balance and then to recoveries of chargedoff principal unpaid interest andor fee expenses while the tdr is in nonaccrual statusresidential mortgage automobile home equity and other consumer loan tdrs  modified loans identified as tdrs are aggregated into pools for analysis cash flows and weighted average interest rates are used to calculate impairment at the pooledloan level once the loans are aggregated into the pool they continue to be classified as tdrs

134table of contentsthe highest risk segment in our investment portfolio is the trust preferred cdo securities which are in the assetbacked securities portfolio this portfolio is in run off and we have not purchased these types of securities since 2005 the fair values of the cdo assets have been impacted by various market conditions the unrealized losses are primarily the result of wider liquidity spreads on assetbacked securities and the longer expected average lives of the trustpreferred cdo securities due to changes in the expectations of when the underlying securities will be repaidcollateralized debt obligations are backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies many collateral issuers have the option of deferring interest payments on their debt for up to five years a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio a thirdparty pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooledtrustpreferred security evaluations is engaged to provide assistance estimating the fair value and expected cash flows on this portfolio the full cash flow analysis is completed by evaluating the relevant credit and structural aspects of each pooledtrustpreferred security in the portfolio including collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in the security and terms of the securitys structure the credit review includes an analysis of profitability credit quality operating efficiency leverage and liquidity using available financial and regulatory information for each underlying collateral issuer the analysis also includes a review of historical industry default data current  near term operating conditions and the impact of macroeconomic and regulatory changes using the results of our analysis we estimate appropriate default and recovery probabilities for each piece of collateral then estimate the expected cash flows for each security the fair value of each security is obtained by discounting the expected cash flows at a market discount rate the market discount rate is determined by reference to yields observed in the market for similarly rated collateralized debt obligations specifically highyield collateralized loan obligations the relatively high market discount rate is reflective of the uncertainty of the cash flows and illiquid nature of these securities the large differential between the fair value and amortized cost of some of the securities reflects the high market discount rate and the expectation that the majority of the cash flows will not be received until near the final maturity of the security the final maturities range from 2032 to 2035on december 10 2013 the federal reserve the occ the fdic the cftc and the sec issued final rules to implement the volcker rule contained in section 619 of the doddfrank act generally to become effective on july 21 2015 the volcker rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates referred to as banking entities from i engaging in proprietary trading and ii investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds covered funds subject to certain limited exceptions these prohibitions impact the ability of us banking entities to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with nonus banking organizations in overseas markets the rule also effectively prohibits shortterm trading strategies by any us banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for tradingon january 14 2014 the five federal agencies approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of section 619 of the volcker rule under the interim final rule the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities if certain qualifications are met in addition the agencies released a nonexclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of the interim final rule at december 31 2015 we had investments in eight different pools of trust preferred securities seven of our pools are included in the list of nonexclusive issuers we have analyzed the icons pool that was not included on the list and believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to hold the icons security to recovery under the final volcker rule regulationsthe following table summarizes the relevant characteristics of our cdo securities portfolio which are included in assetbacked securities at december 31 2015 and 2014 each security is part of a pool of issuers and supports a more senior tranche of securities except for

while sales of msrs occur the precise terms and conditions are typically not readily available therefore the fair value of msrs is estimated using a discounted future cash flow model the model considers portfolio characteristics contractually specified servicing fees and assumptions related to prepayments delinquency rates late charges other ancillary revenues costs to service and other economic factors changes in the assumptions used may have a significant impact on the valuation of msrsmsr values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing

carryforward of 1 million which may be carried forward indefinitely a general business credit carryforward of 1 million which will begin expiring in 2031 and a capital loss carryforward of 13 million which expires in 2018in prior periods huntington established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for federal capital loss carryforwards state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards the federal valuation allowance was based on the uncertainty of forecasted federal taxable income expected of the required character in order to utilize the capital loss carryforward the state valuation allowance was based on the uncertainty of forecasted state taxable income expected in applicable jurisdictions in order to utilize the state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards based on current analysis of both positive and negative evidence and projected forecasted taxable income of the appropriate character andor within applicable jurisdictions the company believes that it is more likely than not the federal capital loss carryforward and portions of the state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards will be realized as a result of this analysis there is no federal capital loss carryforward valuation allowance remaining at december 31 2015 compared to 69 million at december 31 2014 and the state valuation allowance of 4 million  at december 31 2015 was essentially unchanged compared to 4 million at december 31 2014at december 31 2015 retained earnings included approximately 12 million of base year reserves of acquired thrift institutions for which no deferred federal income tax liability has been recognized under current law if these bad debt reserves are used for purposes other than to absorb bad debt losses they will be subject to federal income tax at the current corporate rate the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability relating to the cumulative bad debt deduction was

originated with the intent to sell which are included in loans held for sale mortgage loans held for sale are classified as level 2 and are estimated using security prices for similar product typesmortgage loans held for investmentmortgages are loans originated with the intent to sell and are measured at fair value with adjustments recognized through the consolidated statements of income during the year certain mortgage loans have been reclassified to mortgage loans held for investment these loans continue to be measured at fair value the fair value is determined using fair value of mortgagebacked securities adjusted for loan specific variablesavailableforsale securities and trading account securitiessecurities accounted for at fair value include both the availableforsale and trading portfolios huntington uses prices obtained from thirdparty pricing services and recent trades to determine the fair value of securities afs and trading securities are classified as level 1 using quoted market prices unadjusted in active markets for identical securities that huntington has the ability to access at the measurement date less than 1 of the positions in these portfolios are level 1 and consist of us treasury securities and money market mutual funds when quoted market prices are not available fair values are classified as level 2 using quoted prices for similar assets in active markets quoted prices of identical or similar assets in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 74 of the positions in these portfolios are level 2 and consist of us government and agency debt securities agency mortgage backed securities assetbacked securities municipal securities and other securities for level 2 securities management uses various methods and techniques to corroborate prices obtained from the pricing service including references to dealer or other market quotes and by reviewing valuations of comparable instruments if relevant market prices are limited or unavailable valuations may require significant management judgment or estimation to determine fair value in which case the fair values are classified as level 3 26 of our positions are level 3 and consist of privatelabel cmo securities cdopreferred securities and municipal securities a significant change in the unobservable inputs for these securities may result in a significant change in the ending fair value measurement of these securitiesthe municipal securities portion that is classified as level 3 uses significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the fair value is determined by utilizing thirdparty valuation services the thirdparty service provider reviews credit worthiness prevailing market rates analysis of similar securities and projected cash flows the thirdparty service provider also incorporates industry and general economic conditions into their analysis huntington evaluates the analysis provided for reasonablenessthe private label cmo and cdopreferred securities portfolios are classified as level 3 and as such use significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the private label cmo securities portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows while the cash flows of the cdopreferred securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties and are used as a basis for impairment analysisprivatelabel cmo securities are collateralized by firstlien residential mortgage loans the securities valuation methodology incorporates values obtained from a thirdparty pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and a proprietary pricing model and includes assumptions management believes market participants would use to value the securities under current market conditions the model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds losses recoveries default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures house price depreciation  appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts and discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities with similar collateral structures the privatelabel cmo securities were sold during the 2015 third quarter cdopreferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies a cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio we engage a thirdparty pricing specialist with direct industry experience in cdopreferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio the pd of each issuer 161table of contentsand the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value management evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the thirdparty pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter actual defaults and deferrals in the current period and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair valueautomobile loanseffective january 1 2010 huntington consolidated an automobile loan securitization that previously had been accounted for as an offbalance sheet transaction as a result huntington elected to account for these automobile loan receivables at fair value per guidance supplied in asc 825 the automobile loan receivables are classified as level 3 the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the automobile loan receivables included projections of expected losses and prepayment of the underlying loans in the portfolio and a market assumption of interest rate spreads certain interest rates are available from similarly traded securities while other interest rates are developed internally based on similar assetbacked security transactions in the market during the first quarter of 2014 huntington canceled the 2009 and 2006 automobile trusts huntington continues to report the associated automobile loan receivables at fair value due to its 2010 electionmsrsmsrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices accordingly the fair value of these assets is classified as level 3 huntington determines the fair value of msrs using an income approach model based upon our monthend interest rate curve and prepayment assumptions the model utilizes assumptions to estimate future net servicing income cash flows including estimates of time decay payoffs and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions servicing brokers and other sources of information eg discussion with other mortgage servicers and industry surveys are used to obtain information on market practice and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis thirdparty marks are obtained from at least one servicing broker huntington reviews the valuation assumptions against this market data for reasonableness and adjusts the assumptions if deemed appropriate any recommended change in assumptions andor inputs are presented for review to the mortgage price risk subcommittee for final approvalderivative assets and liabilitiesderivatives classified as level 2 consist of foreign exchange and commodity contracts which are valued using exchange traded swaps and futures market data in addition level 2 includes interest rate contracts which are valued using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates current market interest rates level 2 also includes exchange traded options and forward commitments to deliver mortgagebacked securities which are valued using quoted pricesderivatives classified as level 3 consist of interest rate lock agreements related to mortgage loan commitments the determination of fair value includes assumptions related to the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan which is a significant unobservable assumption

shortterm assets which include cash and due from banks interestbearing deposits in banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements loan commitments and lettersofcredit generally have shortterm variablerate features and contain clauses that limit huntingtons exposure to changes in customer credit quality accordingly their carrying values which are immaterial at the respective balance sheet dates are reasonable estimates of fair value certain assets the most significant being operating lease assets bank owned life insurance and premises and equipment do not meet the definition of a financial instrument and are excluded from this disclosure similarly mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights deposit base and other customer relationship intangibles are not considered financial instruments and are not included above accordingly this fair value information is not intended to and does not represent huntingtons underlying value many of the assets and liabilities subject to the disclosure requirements are not actively traded requiring fair values to be estimated by management these estimations necessarily involve the use of judgment about a wide variety of factors including but not limited to relevancy of market prices of comparable instruments expected future cash flows and appropriate discount ratesthe following methods and assumptions were used by huntington to estimate the fair value of the remaining classes of financial instrumentsheldtomaturity securitiesfair values are determined by using models that are based on securityspecific details as well as relevant industry and economic factors the most significant of these inputs are quoted market prices and interest rate spreads on relevant benchmark securitiesloans and direct financing leasesvariablerate loans that reprice frequently are based on carrying amounts as adjusted for estimated credit losses the fair values for other loans and leases are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and employ interest rates currently being offered for loans and leases with similar terms the rates take into account the position of the yield curve as well as an adjustment for prepayment risk operating costs and profit this value is also reduced by an estimate of expected losses and the credit risk associated in the loan and lease portfolio the valuation of the loan portfolio reflected discounts that huntington believed are consistent with transactions occurring in the marketplacedepositsdemand deposits savings accounts and money market deposits are by definition equal to the amount payable on demand the fair values of fixedrate time deposits are estimated by discounting cash flows using interest rates currently being offered on certificates with similar maturitiesdebtlongterm debt is based upon quoted market prices which are inclusive of huntingtons credit risk in the absence of quoted market prices discounted cash flows using market rates for similar debt with the same maturities are used in the determination of fair value18 derivative financial instruments170table of contentsderivative financial instruments are recorded in the

variablerate and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly shortterm variablerate naturestandby lettersofcredit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a thirdparty these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements including commercial paper bond financing 179table of contentsand similar transactions most of these arrangements mature within two years the carrying amount of deferred revenue associated with these guarantees was 7 million and 4 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectivelythrough the companys credit process huntington monitors the credit risks of outstanding standby lettersofcredit when it is probable that a standby letterofcredit will be drawn and not repaid in full losses are recognized in the provision for credit losses at december 31 2015 huntington had 512 million of standby lettersofcredit outstanding of which 80 were collateralized included in this 512 million total are lettersofcredit issued by the bank that support securities that were issued by customers and remarketed by the huntington investment company the companys brokerdealer subsidiaryhuntington uses an internal grading system to assess an estimate of loss on its loan and lease portfolio this same loan grading system is used to monitor credit risk associated with standby lettersofcredit under this risk rating system as of december 31 2015 approximately 186 million of the standby lettersofcredit were rated strong with sufficient asset quality liquidity and good debt capacity and coverage approximately 326 million were rated average with acceptable asset quality liquidity and modest debt capacity and less than 1 million were rated substandard with negative financial trends structural weaknesses operating difficulties and higher leveragecommercial lettersofcredit represent shortterm selfliquidating instruments that facilitate customer trade transactions and generally have maturities of no longer than 90 days the goods or cargo being traded normally secures these instruments as of december 31 2015 huntington had 56 million of commercial

to third parties at december 31 2015 and 2014 huntington had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of 659 million and 545 million respectively these contracts mature in less than one yearlitigationthe nature of huntingtons business ordinarily results in a certain amount of pending as well as threatened claims litigation investigations regulatory and legal and administrative cases matters and proceedings all of which are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business when the company determines it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted it vigorously defends itself the company considers settlement of cases when in managements judgment it is in the best interests of both the company and its shareholders to do soon at least a quarterly basis huntington assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with threatened and outstanding legal cases matters and proceedings utilizing the latest information available for cases matters and proceedings where it is both probable the company will incur a loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated huntington establishes an accrual for the loss once established the accrual is adjusted as appropriate to reflect any relevant developments for cases matters or proceedings where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated no accrual is establishedin certain cases matters and proceedings exposure to loss exists in excess of the accrual to the extent such loss is reasonably possible but not probable management believes an estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued for current legal proceedings is from 0 to approximately 80 million at december 31 2015 for certain other cases and matters management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss at this time any estimate involves significant judgment given the varying stages of the proceedings including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages the existence of multiple defendants in several of the current proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined the numerous unresolved issues in many of the proceedings and the inherent uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings accordingly managements estimate will change from timetotime and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimatewhile the final outcome of legal cases matters and proceedings is inherently uncertain based on information currently available advice of counsel and available insurance coverage management believes that the amount it has already accrued is adequate and any incremental liability arising from the companys legal cases matters or proceedings will not have a material negative adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position as a whole however in the event of unexpected future developments it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these cases matters and proceedings if unfavorable may be material to the companys consolidated financial position in a particular periodcyberco litigation the bank has been named a defendant in two lawsuits arising from the banks commercial lending depository and equipment leasing relationships with cyberco holdings inc cyberco based in grand rapids michigan in november 2004 the federal bureau of investigation and the

banking and the huntington private client group rbhpcg and home lending the treasury  other function includes our technology and operations other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expense business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions additionally because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entitiesrevenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocationsthe management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all five business segments from treasury  other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury  other expenses except reported significant items and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the five business segmentswe use an active and centralized funds transfer pricing ftp methodology to attribute appropriate income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury  other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury  other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilitiesretail and business banking  the retail and business banking segment provides a wide array of financial
