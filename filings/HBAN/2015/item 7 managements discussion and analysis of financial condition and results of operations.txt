reported net income of 6324 million or 072 per common share relatively unchanged from the prior year this resulted in a 101 return on average assets and a 118 return on average tangible common equity in addition we grew our base of consumer and business customers as we increased 2014 average earning assets by 61 billion or 12 over the prior year our strategic business investments and ocr sales approach continued to generate positive results in 2014 also see significant items influencing financial performance comparisons within the discussion of results of operations  fullytaxable equivalent net interest income was 19 billion in 2014 an increase of 1327 million or 8 compared with 2013 this reflected the impact of 12 earning asset growth partially offset by 13 interestbearing liability growth and a 13 basis point decrease in the nim to 323 the earning asset growth reflected a 36 billion or 9 increase in average loans and leases and a 27 billion or 29 increase in average securities the loan growth reflected an increase in average automobile loans as the growth in originations remained strong also average campi loans increased which primarily reflected growth in trade finance in support of our middle market and corporate customers the securities growth primarily reflected an increase in lcr level 1 qualified securities and direct purchase municipal instruments this earnings asset growth was partially offset by a 47 billion or 13 increase in interestbearing liabilities the interestbearing liability growth reflected a 32 billion or 104 increase in short and longterm borrowings    25    table of contents  and a 22 billion or 14 increase in money market deposits partially offset by a 12 billion or 27 decrease in average core certificates of deposit borrowings have been a cost effective method to fund our incremental securities growth and the change in deposit mix reflects our strategic focus on changing funding sources the nim contraction reflected a 19 basis point decrease related to the mix and yield of earning assets and 3 basis point reduction in the benefit to the margin from the impact of noninterestbearing funds partially offset by the 9 basis point reduction in funding costs  noninterest income was 9792 million in 2014 a decrease of 330 million or 3 compared with 2013 mortgage banking income was down due to a reduction in origination and secondary marketing revenue as originations decreased and gainonsale margins compressed and a negative impact from net msr hedging activity in addition other income declined primarily due to a decrease in lihtc gains and lower fees associated with commercial loan activity and trust services primarily due to a reduction in fees these declines were partially offset by an increase in securities gains as we adjusted the mix of our securities portfolio to prepare for the lcr requirements and an increase in electronic banking income due to higher card related income and underlying customer growth  noninterest expense was 19 billion in 2014 an increase of 1243 million or 7 compared with 2013 this reflected an increase in personnel costs other expense professional services outside data processing and other services and equipment the increase included 655 million of significant items related to franchise repositioning merger and acquisition costs and additions to the litigation reserves this section should be read in conjunction with table 8  noninterest expense excluding the impact of the significant items other noninterest expense increased due to state franchise taxes protective advances and litigation expense professional services increased due to outside consultant expenses related to strategic planning and legal services outside data processing and other services increased primarily reflecting higher debit and credit card processing costs and increased other technology investment expense as we continue to invest in technology supporting our products services and our continuous improvement initiatives  credit quality continued to improve in 2014 nals declined 218 million or 7 from 2013 to 3002 million or 063 of total loans and leases npas declined 144 million or 4 compared to a yearago to 3377 million or 071 of total loans and leases oreo and other npas the decreases primarily reflected meaningful improvement in both cre and residential mortgage nals the provision for credit losses decreased 91 million or 10 from 2013 due to the continued decline in ncos and nonaccrual loans ncos decreased 640 million or 34 from the prior year to 1246 million ncos were an annualized 027 of average loans and leases in the current year compared to 045 in 2013 the acl as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 140 from 165 a year ago while the acl as a percentage of periodend total nals increased slightly to 222 from 221 however criticized and classified loans did increase 951 million or 7 from prior year  the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio at december 31 2014 was 817 down 65 basis points from a year ago our tier 1 common riskbased capital ratio at year end was 1023 down from 1090 at the end of 2013 the regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital ratio at december 31 2014 was 1150 down from 1228 at december 31 2013 the decreases in the capital ratios were due to balance sheet growth and share repurchases that were partially offset by increased retained earnings and the stock issued in the camco financial acquisition specifically all capital ratios were impacted by the repurchase of 357 million common shares over the last four quarters 36 million of which were repurchased during the 2014 fourth quarter this decrease was offset partially by the increase in retained earnings as well as the issuance of 87 million common shares in the camco acquisition huntington estimates the negative impact to tier 1 common riskbased capital from the 2015 first quarter implementation of the federal reserves revised basel iii capital rules will be approximately 40 basis points on a fully phasedin basis  business overview  general  our general business objectives are 1 grow net interest income and fee

results we are achieving for the past several years we have invested in the company at a time when most of the industry has been pulling back we have expanded and optimized our retail distribution both physical and digital we have invested in small business and commercial specialty lending verticals we have added new products such as our consumer and commercial credit cards and our new business and consumer checking accounts these represent just a handful of the investments we have made our 2014 earnings reflected results from these investments yet significant opportunity remains as none of these investments are mature we have a strong outlook for the future    26    table of contents economy  we remain optimistic on the economy in our footprint as fundamentals look positive home prices are improving and the recent reduction in interest rates provides another refinance window automobile sales were very strong in 2014 and appear poised for another great if not even better year in 2015

customer activity among our core small and middle market business customer base continues to trend favorably  legislative and regulatory  a comprehensive discussion of legislative and regulatory matters affecting us can be found in the regulatory matters section included in item 1 of this form 10k  2015 expectations  as we move into 2015 customer activity is strong pipelines are stable and our balance sheet is well positioned we built our plan with an assumption of no change in interest rates and with the flexibility to quickly adjust to the evolving operating environment we remain committed to investing in the business disciplined expense control and delivering fullyear positive operating leverage  excluding significant items and net msr hedging activity we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in 2015 with revenue growth exceeding noninterest expense growth of 24  overall asset quality metrics are expected to remain near current levels although moderate quarterly volatility also is expected given the absolute low level of problem assets and credit costs we anticipate ncos will remain within or below our longterm normalized range of 35 to 55 basis points  the effective tax rate for 2015 is expected to be in the range of 25 to 28    27    table of contents table 2selected annual income statements 1                                        year ended december

also includes a significant items section that summarizes key issues important for a complete understanding of performance trends key consolidated balance sheet and income statement trends are discussed all earnings per share data are reported on a diluted basis for additional insight on financial performance please read this section in conjunction with the business segment discussion  significant items  definition of significant items  from timetotime revenue expenses or taxes are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities and  or by items that while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or shortterm in nature we refer to such items as significant items most often these significant items result from factors originating outside the company eg regulatory actions  assessments windfall gains changes in accounting principles onetime tax assessments  refunds litigation actions etc in other cases they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business eg merger  restructuring charges recapitalization actions goodwill impairment etc  even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions as a general rule volatility alone does not define a significant item for example changes in the provision for credit losses gains  losses from investment activities asset valuation writedowns etc reflect ordinary banking activities and are therefore typically excluded from consideration as a significant item  we believe the disclosure of significant items provides a better understanding of our performance and trends to ascertain which of such items if any to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance ie within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations as well as how if at all to adjust estimates of future performance accordingly to this end we adopted a practice of listing significant items in our external disclosure documents eg earnings press releases investor presentations forms 10q and 10k  significant items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance  significant items influencing financial performance comparisons  earnings comparisons among the three years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were impacted by a number of significant items summarized below        1 franchise repositioning related expense significant events relating to franchise repositioning related expense and the impacts of those events on our reported results were as follows            during 2014 280 million of franchise repositioning related expense was recorded for the consolidation of 26 branches and organizational actions this resulted in a negative impact of 002 per common share in 2014            during 2013 235 million of franchise repositioning related expense was recorded this

average balance sheet  our primary source of revenue is net interest income which is the difference between interest income from earning assets primarily loans securities and direct financing leases and interest expense of funding sources primarily interestbearing deposits and borrowings earning asset balances and related funding sources as well as changes in the levels of interest rates impact net interest income the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interestbearing liabilities is the net interest spread noninterestbearing sources of funds such as demand deposits and shareholders equity also support earning assets the impact of the noninterestbearing sources of funds often referred to as free funds is captured in the net interest margin which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a fullytaxable equivalent basis which means that taxfree interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income assuming a 35 tax rate  the following table shows changes in fullytaxable equivalent interest income interest expense and net

found in the risk governance section included in item 1a and the regulatory matters section of item 1 of this form 10k  some of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit market liquidity operational and compliance risks are described in the following paragraphs  credit risk  credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending we also have credit risk associated with our afs and htm securities portfolios see note 4 and note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management mortgage banking and trading activities while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity we believe this exposure is minimal  we continue to focus on the identification monitoring and managing of our credit risk in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes market risk management activities and portfolio diversification we use additional quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources enhanced use of modeling technology and internal stress testing processes our portfolio management resources demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile in our efforts to continue to identify risk mitigation techniques we have focused on product design features origination policies and treatment strategies for delinquent or stressed borrowers  the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers all authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type geography industry and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives although we offer a broad set of products we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk portfolio profile  the checks and balances in the credit process and the separation of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution for example we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage position    38    table of contents our asset quality indicators reflected continued overall improvement of our credit quality performance in 2014  loan and lease credit exposure mix  at december 31 2014 our loans and leases totaled 477 billion

other projects the majority of these borrowers are customers doing business within our geographic regions campi loans and leases are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company andor the personal guarantee of the business owners the financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a campi loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral this treatment is a result of the credit decision process which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt the operation sale rental or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans as we have expanded our campi portfolio we have developed a series of vertical specialties to ensure that new products or lending types are embedded within a structured centralized commercial lending area with designated experienced credit officers these specialties are comprised of either targeted industries for example healthcare food amp agribusiness energy etc andor lending disciplines equipment finance abl etc all of which requires a high degree of expertise and oversight to effectively mitigate and monitor risk as such we have dedicated colleagues and teams focused on bringing value added expertise to these specialty clients  cre  cre loans consist of loans to developers and reits supporting incomeproducing or forsale commercial real estate properties we mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement these loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings office and industrial buildings and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation sale or refinance of the property  construction cre  construction cre loans are loans to developers companies or individuals used for the construction of a commercial or residential

invested in each project these loans are underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate lending group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule  total consumer loans and leases were 234 billion at december 31 2014 and represented 49 of our total loan and lease credit exposure the consumer portfolio

of the borrowers management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process we utilize a centralized preview and senior loan approval committee led by our chief credit officer the risk rating see next paragraph and complexity of the credit determines the threshold for approval of the senior loan committee with a minimum credit exposure of 100 million for loans not requiring senior loan committee approval with the exception of small business loans credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority for small business loans we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures in this centralized decision environment certain individuals who understand each local region may make creditextension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities we operate in in addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval process  in commercial lending ongoing credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan we monitor all significant exposures on an ongoing basis all commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrowers pd and lgd this twodimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process the pd is rated and applied at the borrower level the lgd is rated and applied based on the specific type of credit extension and the quality and lien position associated with the underlying collateral the internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each periodic monitoring event there is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an ongoing basis we continually review and adjust our riskrating criteria based on actual experience which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate allowance for credit losses acl amount for the commercial portfolio a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio including small business loans to provide consistent oversight  in addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and risk of new loan originations this group is part of our risk management area and conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of credit processes  our standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment one of which is guarantor support on an annual basis or more frequently if warranted we consider among other things the guarantors reputation and creditworthiness along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth assuming such information is available our assessment of the guarantors credit strength or lack thereof is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans which is directly tied to and an integral component of our acl methodology when a loan goes to impaired status viable guarantor support is considered in the determination of a credit loss  if our assessment of the guarantors credit strength yields an inherent capacity to perform we will seek repayment from the guarantor as part of the collection process and have done so successfully however we do not formally track the repayment success from guarantors  substantially all loans categorized as classified see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements are managed by our special assets department sad the sad group is a specialized group of credit professionals that handle the daytoday management of workouts commercial recoveries and problem loan sales its

recourse requirements and continuous portfolio risk management activities our origination policies for this portfolio include loan producttype specific policies such as ltv and debt service coverage ratios as applicable  the campi portfolio continues to have strong origination activity as evidenced by the growth over the past 12 months the credit quality of the portfolio remains strong as we maintain a focus on high quality originations problem loans have trended downward over the last several years reflecting a combination of proactive risk identification and effective workout strategies implemented by the sad we continue to maintain a proactive approach to identifying borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty in order to maximize the potential solutions  cre portfolio  we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio specific to cre lending focusing on the quality of the developer and the specifics associated with each project generally we 1 limit our loans to 80 of the appraised value of the commercial real estate at origination 2 require net operating cash flows to be 125 of required interest and principal payments and 3 if the commercial real estate is nonowner occupied require that at least 50 of the space of the project be preleased we actively monitor both geographic and projecttype concentrations and performance metrics of all cre loan types with a focus on loans identified as higher risk based on the risk rating methodology both macrolevel and loanlevel stresstest scenarios based on existing and forecast market conditions are part of the ongoing portfolio management process for the cre portfolio  dedicated real estate professionals originate and manage the majority of the portfolio with the remainder obtained from prior bank acquisitions the portfolio is diversified by project type and loan size and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio subsequent to the origination of the loan the credit review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new loan originations  appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals and on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements appraisals are obtained from approved vendors and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process we continue to perform ongoing portfolio level reviews within the cre portfolio these reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the projects being reviewed property values are updated using appraisals on a regular basis to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the ongoing management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions this highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers as well as an indepth knowledge of cre project lending and the market environment  consumer credit  consumer credit approvals are based on among other factors the financial strength and payment history of the borrower type of exposure and the transaction structure consumer credit decisions are generally made in a centralized environment utilizing decision models importantly certain individuals who understand each local region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our focus on the local communities we operate in each credit extension is assigned a specific pd and lgd the pd is generally based on the borrowers most recent credit bureau score fico which we update quarterly while the lgd is related to the type of collateral and the ltv ratio associated with the credit extension  in consumer lending credit risk is managed from a segment ie loan type collateral position geography etc and vintage performance analysis all portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators we make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the

centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system    43    table of contents given the low interest rate environment over the past several years many borrowers have utilized the lineofcredit home equity product as the primary source of financing their home versus residential mortgages the proportion of the home equity portfolio secured by a firstlien has increased significantly over the past three years positively impacting the portfolios risk profile at december 31 2014 51 billion or 60 of our total home equity portfolio was secured by firstlien mortgages compared to 58 in the prior year the firstlien position combined with continued high average fico scores and high ltv significantly reduces the credit risk associated with these loans  within the home equity portfolio the standard product is a 10year interestonly draw period with a 20year fully amortizing term at the end of the draw period prior to 2007 the standard product was a 10year draw period with a balloon payment in either case after the 10year draw period the borrower must reapply subject to full underwriting guidelines to continue with the interest only revolving structure or begin repaying the debt in a term structure  the principal and interest payment associated with the term structure will be higher than the interestonly payment resulting in maturity risk our maturity risk can be segregated into two distinct segments 1 home equity linesofcredit underwritten with a balloon payment at maturity and 2 home equity linesofcredit with an automatic conversion to a 20year amortizing loan we manage this risk based on both the actual maturity date of the lineofcredit structure and at the end of the 10year draw period this maturity risk is embedded in the portfolio which we address with proactive contact strategies beginning one year prior to maturity in certain circumstances our home saver group is able to provide payment and structure relief to borrowers

portfolio see operational risk discussion  credit quality  this section should be read in conjunction with note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of credit quality performance ratios this approach forms the basis of most of the discussion in the sections immediately following

quality performance in 2014 reflected continued overall improvement npas declined 4 to 3377 million compared to december 31 2013 as the cre automobile and residential portfolio segments showed declines this was partially offset by increases in campi primarily due to two credit relationships and home equity as a result of lower partial chargeoffs due the housing market recovery from the lows in 20102011 ncos decreased 34 compared to the prior year as a result of declines in the cre home equity and residential portfolios total criticized loans continued to decline across both the

concessions subsequent to the initial tdr terms however there are times when subsequent modifications are required such as when the modified loan matures often the loans are performing in accordance with the tdr terms and a new note is originated with similar modified terms these loans are subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing if the loan is not performing in accordance with the existing tdr terms typically an individualized approach to repayment is established in accordance with asc 3102035 the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan a new loan is considered for removal of the tdr designation a continuation of the prior note requires the continuation of the tdr designation and because the refinanced note constitutes a new or amended debt instrument it is included in our tdr activity table below as a new tdr and a restructured tdr removal during the period  the types of concessions granted are consistent with those granted on new tdrs and include interest rate reductions amortization or maturity date changes beyond what the collateral supports and principal forgiveness based on the borrowers specific needs at a point in time our policy does not limit the number of times a loan may be modified a loan may be modified multiple times if it is considered to be in the best interest of both the borrower and huntington    47    table of contents commercial loans are not automatically considered to be accruing tdrs upon the granting of a new concession if the loan is in accruing status and no loss is expected based on the modified terms the modified tdr remains in accruing status for loans that are on nonaccrual status before the modification collection of both principal and interest must not be in doubt and the borrower must be able to exhibit sufficient cash flows for a sixmonth period of time to service the debt in order to return to accruing status this sixmonth period could extend before or after the restructure date  tdrs in the home equity and residential mortgage portfolio may continue to increase in the near term as we continue to appropriately manage the portfolio and work with our borrowers any granted change in terms or conditions that are not readily available in the market for that borrower requires the designation as a tdr there are no provisions for the removal of the tdr designation based on payment activity for consumer loans  the following table reflects tdr activity

with note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  our total credit reserve is comprised of two different components both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the alll and the aulc combined these reserves comprise the total acl our credit administration group is responsible for developing the methodology assumptions and estimates used in the calculation as well as determining the appropriateness of the acl the alll represents the estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reported date additions to the alll result from recording provision expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting from loan riskrating downgrades while reductions reflect chargeoffs net of recoveries decreased risk levels resulting from loan riskrating upgrades or the sale of loans the aulc is determined by applying the transaction reserve process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation  the provision for credit losses in 2014 was 810 million compared with 900 million in 2013  we regularly evaluate the appropriateness of the acl by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above we also consider the impact of collateral value trends and portfolio diversification a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the acl to the level we have determined to be appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio  our acl evaluation process includes the ongoing assessment of credit quality metrics and a comparison of certain acl benchmarks to current performance while the total acl balance has declined in recent quarters all of the relevant benchmarks remain

with december 31 2013 primarily due to the risk rating composition and overall growth in the portfolio the cre acl decreased 597 million or 37 compared with december 31 2013 due to the continued

lower ltv the december 31 2014 cre acl covers nals by more than two times the home equity portfolio alll declined consistent with the improving credit quality metrics the alll for the other consumer portfolio is consistent with expectations given the increasing level of overdraft exposure the reduction in the acl compared with december 31 2013 is primarily a function of the decline in the cre portfolio and improving economic conditions  compared with december 31 2013 the aulc decreased 21 million primarily reflecting the impact of an updated assessment of the unfunded commercial exposure  the acl to total loans declined to 140 at december 31 2014 compared to 165 at december 31 2013 management believes the decline in the ratio is appropriate given the continued improvement in the risk profile of our loan portfolio further the continued focus on early identification of loans with changes in credit metrics and proactive action plans for these loans combined with originating high quality new loans will contribute to maintaining our strong key credit quality metrics  given the combination of these noted positive and negative factors we believe that our acl is appropriate and its coverage level is reflective of the quality of our portfolio and the current operating environment  ncos  any loan in any portfolio may be chargedoff prior to the policies described below if a

deteriorate over time the alll established is consistent with the level of risk associated with the original underwriting as a part of our normal portfolio management process for commercial loans the loan is periodically reviewed and the alll is increased or decreased based on the updated risk rating in certain cases the standard alll is determined to not be appropriate and a specific reserve is established based on the projected cash flow or collateral value of the specific loan chargeoffs if necessary are generally recognized in a period after the specific alll was established if the previously established alll exceeds that necessary to satisfactorily resolve the problem loan a reduction in the overall level of the alll could be recognized consumer loans are treated in much the same manner as commercial loans with increasing reserve factors applied based on the risk characteristics of the loan although specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans in summary if loan quality deteriorates the typical credit sequence would be periods of reserve building followed by periods of higher ncos as the previously established alll is utilized additionally an increase in the alll either precedes or is in conjunction with increases in nals when a loan is classified as nal it is evaluated for specific alll or chargeoff as a result an increase in nals does not necessarily result in an increase in the alll or an expectation of higher future ncos  all residential mortgage loans greater than 150days past due are chargeddown to the estimated value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs the remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed or the loan goes through the foreclosure process for the home equity portfolio virtually all of the defaults represent full chargeoffs as there is no remaining equity creating a lower delinquency rate but a higher nco impact  2014 versus 2013  ncos decreased 640 million or 34 in 2014 primarily as a result of continued credit quality this improvement was partially offset by an increase in campi primarily relating to large losses associated with a small number of credit relationships    51    table of contents market risk  market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities we incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads we have identified two primary sources of market risk interest rate risk and price risk  interest rate risk  overview  huntington actively manages interest rate risk as changes in market interest rates can have a significant impact on reported earnings the interest rate risk process is designed to compare income simulations in market scenarios designed to alter the direction magnitude and speed of interest rate changes as well as the slope of the yield curve these scenarios are designed to illustrate the embedded optionality in the balance sheet from among other things faster or slower mortgage prepayments and changes in deposit mix  during the 2014 fourth quarter we updated various assumptions associated with the modeling of nonmaturity deposit behavior as interest rates change the most significant change was the removal of a stress component that caused forecasted deposit balances to be lower than actual deposit balances the new assumptions better align the behavior of our nonmaturity deposits with our experience and expectations the assumption changes primarily impacted eve at risk by making the 100 and 200 shock scenarios less liability sensitive the assumption changes did not materially impact the nii at risk the results are further discussed below  income simulation and economic value analysis  interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the alco monthly and roc at least quarterly the information reported includes periodend results and identifies any policy limits exceeded along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution mitigation or assumption of the risk  huntington uses two approaches to model interest rate risk net interest income at risk nii at risk and economic value of equity eve under nii at risk net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets liabilities and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a oneyear time horizon eve measures the period end market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change eve is a period end measurement  table 20net interest income at risk                        net interest income at risk      basis point

   through december 31 2013 we reported ise at risk we now report nii at risk to isolate the change in income related solely to interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities the difference between the results for ise at risk and nii at risk are not significant for this or any previous fiscal year  the nii at risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management it models gradual 25 100 and 200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates implied by the forward yield curve over the next oneyear period due to the current low level of shortterm interest rates the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of 25 basis points the point at which many assets and liabilities reach zero percent  huntington is within board policy limits for the 100 and 200 basis point scenarios there is no policy limit for the 25 basis point scenario the nii at risk reported at december 31 2014 shows that huntingtons earnings are not particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates over the next year in recent periods the amount of fixed rate assets primarily indirect auto loans and securities increased resulting in a reduction in asset sensitivity this reduction is somewhat accentuated by our portfolio of mortgagerelated loans and securities whose expected maturities lengthen as rates rise the reduced asset sensitivity for the 200 basis points scenario relative to the 100 basis points scenario relates to the modeled migration of money market accounts balances into cds thereby shifting deposits from a variable rate to a fixed rate    52    table of contents table 21economic value of equity at risk                        economic value of equity at risk      basis point change scenario     25       100       200

interest rates due to the current low level of shortterm interest rates the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of 25 basis points the point at which many assets and liabilities reach zero percent  huntington is within board policy limits for the 100 and 200 basis point scenarios there is no policy limit for the 25 basis point scenario the eve reported at december 31 2014 shows that as interest rates increase decrease immediately the economic value of equity position will decrease increase when interest rates rise fixed rate assets generally lose economic value the longer the duration the greater the value lost the opposite is true when interest rates fall the eve at risk reported as of december 31 2014 for the 200 basis points scenario shows a change to a less liability sensitive position compared with december 31 2013 the primary factor contributing to this change was the impact of substantially lower interest rates in addition the assumption changes mentioned above reduced liability sensitivity in the 200 basis point scenario by 34  msr  this section should be read in conjunction with note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  at december 31 2014 we had a total of 1556 million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service 156 billion in mortgage loans of this 1556 million 228 million was recorded using the fair value method and 1328 million was recorded using the amortization method  msr fair values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be greatly reduced by prepayments prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise we have employed strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment however volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these hedges we typically report msr fair value adjustments net of hedgerelated trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking income  msrs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with historically low interest rates resulting in a lower probability of prepayments and ultimately impairment msr assets are included in accrued income and other assets in the consolidated financial statements  price risk  price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting we have price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions equity investments investments in securities backed by mortgage loans and marketable equity securities held by our insurance subsidiaries we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held by the insurance subsidiaries  liquidity risk  liquidity risk is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments resulting from external macro market issues investor and customer perception of financial strength and events unrelated to us such as war terrorism or financial institution market specific issues in addition the mix and maturity structure of huntingtons balance sheet the amount of onhand cash and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding can have an impact on huntingtons ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments we manage liquidity risk at both the bank and the parent company    53    table of contents the overall objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can obtain costeffective funding to meet current and future obligations and can maintain sufficient levels of onhand liquidity under both normal businessasusual and unanticipated stressed circumstances the alco was appointed by the roc to oversee liquidity risk management and the establishment of liquidity risk policies and limits contingency funding plans are in place which measure forecasted sources and uses of funds under various scenarios in order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages liquidity risk is reviewed monthly for the bank and the parent company as well as its subsidiaries in addition liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions provide policy guidance review funding strategies and oversee the adherence to and maintenance of the contingency funding plans  availableforsale and other securities portfolio  this section should be read in conjunction with note 4 of the notes to consolidated

billion at december 31 2013 the increase from prior yearend primarily relates to an increase in longterm debt brokered deposits and negotiable cds  liquidity coverage ratio  on october 24 2013 the us banking regulators jointly issued a proposal that would implement a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio lcr standard established by the basel committee on banking supervision the lcr is designed to promote the shortterm resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks to which it applies  on september 3 2014 the us banking regulators adopted a final lcr for internationally active banking organizations generally those with 250 billion or more in total assets and a modified lcr rule for banking organizations similar to huntington with 50 billion or more in total assets that are not internationally active banking organizations the modified lcr requires huntington to maintain high quality liquid assets hqla to meet its net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendarday period which takes into account the potential impact of idiosyncratic and marketwide shocks the modified lcr transition period begins on january 1 2016 with huntington required to maintain hqla equal to 90 percent of the stated requirement the ratio increases to 100 percent on january 1 2017 huntington expects to be compliant with the modified lcr requirement within the transition periods established in the modified lcr rule  at december 31 2014 we believe the bank had sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future  table

nonbank subsidiaries repurchases of our stock and acquisitions the parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends and interest received from the bank interest and dividends received from direct subsidiaries net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return fees for services provided to subsidiaries and the issuance of debt securities  at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 the parent company had 07 billion and 10 billion respectively in cash and cash equivalents  on january 21 2015 the board of directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of 006 per common share the dividend is payable on april 1 2015 to shareholders of record on march 18 2015 based on the current quarterly dividend of 006    57    table of contents per common share cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately 487 million per quarter on january 21 2015 the board of directors declared a quarterly series a and

be approximately 77 million per quarter cash demands required for series b preferred stock are expected to be approximately 03 million per quarter  during 2014 the bank paid dividends of 2440 million to the holding company we anticipate that the bank will declare additional dividends to the holding company in the first quarter of 2015 to help meet any additional liquidity needs we have an openended automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the sec which permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities  with the exception of the items discussed above the parent company does not have any significant cash demands it is our policy to keep operating cash on hand at the parent company to satisfy cash demands for at least the next 18 months considering the factors discussed above and other analyses that we have performed we believe the parent company has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future  offbalance sheet arrangements  in the normal course of business we enter into various offbalance sheet arrangements these arrangements include interest rate swaps financial guarantees contained in standby lettersofcredit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans  interest rate swaps  balance sheet hedging activity is arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment and is classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges fair value hedges are purchased to convert deposits and subordinated and other longterm debt from fixedrate obligations to floating rate cash flow hedges are also used to convert floating rate loans made to customers into fixed rate loans see note 18 for more information  standby lettersofcredit  standby lettersofcredit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements including commercial paper bond financing and similar transactions most of these arrangements mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon standby lettersofcredit are included in the determination of the amount of riskbased capital that the parent company and the bank are required to hold through our credit process we monitor the credit risks of outstanding standby lettersofcredit when it is probable that a standby letterofcredit will be drawn and not repaid in full a loss is recognized in the provision for credit losses see note 20 for more information  commitments to sell loans  activity relating to our mortgage origination activity supports the hedging of the mortgage pricing commitments to customers and the secondary sale to third parties at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 we had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of 5450 million and 4526 million respectively these contracts mature in less than one year  we do not

error inadequate or failed internal systems and controls including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters and security risks we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations and to improve the oversight of our operational risk for example we actively and continuously monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data we evaluate internal systems processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any material losses in addition we are investing significantly in an effort to minimize these risks  to mitigate operational risks we have a senior management operational risk committee and a senior management legal regulatory and compliance committee the responsibilities of these committees among other duties include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns risks or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues in addition we have a senior management model risk oversight committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise these committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the risk management committee potential concerns may be escalated to our roc as appropriate  our objective for cyber security is to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on their goals to this end we employ strategies to make huntington less attractive as a target while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response potential concerns related to cyber security may be escalated to our technology committee as appropriate  the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies minimize operational and fraud losses minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance  representation and warranty reserve  we primarily conduct our mortgage loan sale and securitization activity with fnma and fhlmc in connection with these and other securitization transactions we make certain representations and warranties that the loans meet certain criteria such as collateral type and underwriting standards we may be required to repurchase individual loans and  or indemnify these organizations against losses due to a loan not meeting the established criteria we have a reserve for such losses and exposure which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities the reserves are estimated based on historical and expected repurchase activity average loss rates and current economic trends the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon economic factors investor demand strategies and other external conditions containing a level of uncertainty and risk that may change over the life of the underlying loans we currently do not have sufficient information to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss related to representation and warranty exposure  the tables below reflect

subject to many laws rules and regulations at both the federal and state levels in september for example the office of the comptroller of the currency issued its final rule formalizing its heightened expectations supervisory regime for the largest federally chartered depository institutions including huntington to improve risk management and ensure boards can challenge decisions made by management these broadbased laws rules and regulations include but are not limited to expectations relating to antimoney laundering lending limits client privacy fair lending prohibitions against unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices protections for military members as they enter active duty and community reinvestment additionally the volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk as such we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws rules and regulations our colleagues receive training for several broadbased laws and regulations including but not limited to antimoney laundering and customer privacy additionally colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection equal credit opportunity fair lending and  or other courses related to the extension of credit we set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance  capital  this section should be read in conjunction

decreases in the capital ratios were due to balance sheet growth and share repurchases that were partially offset by retained earnings and the 87 million common shares issued in the camco financial acquisition specifically all capital ratios were impacted by the repurchase of 357 million common shares in 2014  shareholders equity  we generate shareholders equity primarily through the retention of earnings net of dividends other potential sources of shareholders equity include issuances of common and preferred stock our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives to meet both regulatory and market expectations and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities shareholders equity totaled 63 billion at december 31 2014 representing a 02 billion or 4 increase compared with december 31 2013 primarily due to an increase in retained earnings offset by share repurchases  dividends  we consider disciplined capital management as a key objective with dividends representing one component our strong capital ratios and expectations for continued earnings growth positions us to continue to actively explore additional capital management opportunities  on january 22 2015 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 006 per common share payable on april 1 2015 also cash dividends of 006 per common share were declared on october 15 2014 and 005 per common share were declared on july 16 2014 april 16 2014 and january 16 2014 our 2014 capital plan to the frb included

time to time the board of directors authorizes the company to repurchase shares of our common stock although we announce when the board of directors authorizes share repurchases we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares future stock repurchases may be private or openmarket repurchases including block transactions accelerated or delayed block transactions forward transactions and similar transactions various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases including our capital requirements the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions market conditions including the trading price of our stock and regulatory and legal considerations including the frbs response to our capital plan  on march 26 2014 huntington announced that the federal reserve did not object to huntingtons proposed capital actions included in huntingtons capital plan submitted to the federal reserve in january 2014 these actions included a potential repurchase of up to 250 million of common stock from the second quarter of 2014 through the first quarter of 2015 huntingtons board of directors authorized a share repurchase program consistent with huntingtons capital plan this repurchase authorization represents a 23 million or 10 increase from the prior common stock repurchase authorization during 2014 we repurchased 357 million shares with a weighted average price of 937 purchases of common stock may include open market purchases privately negotiated transactions and accelerated repurchase programs we have approximately 517 million remaining under the current authorization  business segment discussion  overview  our business segments are based on our internallyaligned segment leadership structure which is how we monitor results and assess performance during the 2014 first quarter we reorganized our business segments to drive our ongoing growth and leverage the knowledge of our highly experienced team we now have five major business segments retail and business banking    62    table of contents  commercial banking automobile finance and commercial real estate afcre regional banking and the huntington private client group rbhpcg and home lending a treasury  other function includes technology and operations other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expense all periods presented have been reclassified to conform to the current period classification  business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions  revenue sharing  revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations  expense allocation  the management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all five business segments from treasury  other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury  other expenses except reported significant items and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the five business segments  funds transfer pricing ftp  we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury  other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury  other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilities  net income by business segment  the segregation of net income by business segment for the past three years is presented in the following table  table 33net

is lower as a result treasury  other reflects a credit for income taxes representing the difference between the lower actual effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate used to allocate income taxes to the business segments  optimal customer relationship ocr  our ocr strategy is focused on building and deepening relationships with our customers through superior interactions product penetration and quality of service we will deliver highquality customer and prospect interactions through a fully integrated sales culture which will include all partners necessary to deliver a total huntington solution the quality of our relationships will lead to our ability to be the primary bank for our customers yielding quality annuitized revenue and profitable share of customers overall financial services revenue we believe our relationship oriented approach will drive a competitive advantage through our local market delivery channels  consumer ocr performance  for consumer ocr performance there are three key performance metrics 1 the number of checking account households 2 the number of product penetration per consumer checking household and 3 the revenue generated from the consumer households of all business segments  the growth in consumer checking account number of households is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing checking account households the overall objective is to grow the number of households along with an increase in product penetration  we use the checking account since it typically represents the primary banking relationship product we count additional services by type not number of services for example a household that has one checking account and one mortgage we count as having two services a household with four checking accounts we count as having one service the household relationship utilizing four or more services is viewed to be more profitable and loyal the overall objective therefore is to decrease the percentage of 13 services per consumer checking account household while increasing the percentage of those with 4 or more services since we have made significant strides toward having the vast majority of our customers with 4 services during the 2013 second quarter we changed our measurement to 6 services we are holding ourselves to a higher performance standard  the following table

2014 huntington acquired 37939 bank of america households  our emphasis on crosssell coupled with customers being attracted by the benefits offered through our fair play banking philosophy with programs such as 24hour grace on overdrafts and asteriskfree checking are having a positive effect the percent of consumer households with 6 or more products services at the end of 2014 was 494 up from 476 at the end of last year for 2014 consumer checking account households grew 10 total consumer checking account household revenue in 2014 was 10170 million up 689 million or 7 from 2013    64    table of contents commercial ocr performance  for commercial ocr performance there are three key performance metrics 1 the number of commercial relationships 2 the number of services penetration per commercial relationship and 3 the revenue generated commercial relationships include relationships from all business segments  the growth in the number of commercial relationships is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing commercial accounts the overall objective is to grow the number of relationships along with an increase in product service distribution  the commercial relationship is defined as a business banking or commercial banking customer with a checking account relationship we use this metric because we believe that the checking account anchors a business relationship and creates the opportunity to increase our crosssell multiple sales of the same type of service are counted as one service the same as consumer  the following

consolidated financial statements    79    table of contents acl as a percent of total loans and leases at december 31 2014 was 140 down from 165 at december 31 2013 we believe the decline in the ratio is appropriate given the continued improvement in the risk profile of our loan portfolio further we believe that early identification of loans with changes in credit metrics and aggressive action plans for these loans combined with originating high quality new loans will contribute to maintaining our key credit quality metrics table 46selected quarterly income statement data 1

including certain plans expectations goals projections and statements which are subject to numerous assumptions risks and uncertainties statements that do not describe historical or current facts including statements about beliefs and expectations are forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may be identified by words such as expect anticipate believe intend estimate plan target goal or similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will may might should would could or similar variations the forwardlooking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor provided by section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995  while there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the forwardlooking statements 1 worsening of credit quality performance due to a number of factors such as the underlying value of collateral that could prove less valuable than otherwise assumed and assumed cash flows may be worse than expected 2 changes in general economic political or industry conditions uncertainty in us fiscal and monetary policy including the interest rate policies of the federal reserve board volatility and disruptions in global capital and credit markets 3 movements in interest rates 4 competitive pressures on product pricing and services 5 success impact and timing of our business strategies including market acceptance of any new products or services implementing our fair play banking philosophy 6 changes in accounting policies and principles and the accuracy of our    83    table of contents  assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements 7 extended disruption of vital infrastructure 8 the final outcome of significant litigation 9 the nature extent timing and results of governmental actions examinations reviews reforms regulations and interpretations including those related to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the basel iii regulatory capital reforms as well as those involving the occ federal reserve fdic and cfpb and 10 the outcome of judicial and regulatory decisions regarding practices in the residential mortgage industry including among other things the processes followed for foreclosing residential mortgages  all forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information available at that time we assume no obligation to update forwardlooking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forwardlooking statements were made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by federal securities laws as forwardlooking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance on such statements  nonregulatory capital ratios  in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including         tangible common equity to tangible assets         tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets using basel i and basel iii definitions and         tangible common equity to riskweighted assets using basel i definition  these nonregulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the companys capitalization to other financial services companies these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies these ratios are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap or federal banking regulations as a result these nonregulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company are considered nongaap financial measures  because there are no standardized definitions for these nonregulatory capital ratios the companys calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies also there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors as a result the company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10k in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure  risk factors  more information on risk is set forth under the heading risk factors included in item 1a and incorporated by reference into this mdampa additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the risk management and capital discussion as well as the regulatory matters section included in item 1 and incorporated by reference into the mdampa  critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates  our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference into this mdampa describes the significant accounting policies we use in our consolidated financial statements  an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below  allowance for credit losses  our acl of 07 billion at december 31 2014 represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risk associated    84    table of contents  with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  in addition bank regulators periodically review our acl and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan chargeoffs any increase in our acl or loan chargeoffs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  valuation of financial instruments  assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility assets measured at fair value include mortgage loans held for sale availableforsale and trading securities certain securitized automobile loans derivatives and certain securitization trust notes payable at december 31 2014 approximately 99 billion of our assets and 03 billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value in addition to the above mentioned ongoing fair value measurements fair value is also the unit of measure for recording business combinations and other nonrecurring financial assets and liabilities   at the end of each quarter we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured at fair value as necessary assets or liabilities may be transferred within fair value hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date  where available we use quoted market prices to determine fair value if quoted market prices are not available fair value is determined using either internally developed or independent third party valuation models based on inputs that are either directly observable or derived from market data these inputs include but are not limited to interest rate yield curves option volatilities or option adjusted spreads where neither quoted market prices nor observable market data are available fair value is determined using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on managements expectation that market participants would use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability the determination of appropriate unobservable inputs requires exercise of management judgment a significant portion of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value are measured based on quoted market prices and observable market or independent inputs  the following is a description of the significant estimates used in the valuation of financial assets and liabilities for which quoted market prices and observable market parameters are not available  mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities  our alta private label cmo and pooledtrustpreferred securities portfolios are classified as level 3 and as such use significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the alta and private label cmo securities portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows while the cash flows of our pooledtrustpreferred securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties and are used as a basis for impairment analysis  alta mortgagebacked and privatelabel cmo securities are collateralized by firstlien residential mortgage loans the securities valuation methodology incorporates values obtained from a third party pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and a proprietary pricing model and includes assumptions management believes market participants would use to value the securities under current market conditions the model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds losses recoveries default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures house price depreciation  appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts and discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities with similar collateral structures  pooledtrustpreferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio we engage a thirdparty pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooledtrustpreferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio the pd of each issuer and the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value management evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the thirdparty pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter actual    85    table of contents  defaults and deferrals in the current period and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with asc 820  derivatives used for hedging purposes  derivatives designated as qualified hedges are tested for hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis assessments are made at the inception of the hedge and on a recurring basis to determine whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item a statistical regression analysis is performed to measure the effectiveness  if based on the assessment a derivative is not expected to be a highly effective hedge or it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge hedge accounting is discontinued as of the quarter the hedge is not highly effective as the statistical regression analysis requires the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are sensitive to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates we consider this a critical accounting estimate  loans held for sale  huntington has elected to apply the fair value option to certain residential mortgage loans that are classified as held for sale at origination the fair value is estimated based on security prices for similar product types  certain consumer and commercial loans are classified as held for sale and are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value the determination of fair value for these consumer loans is based on security prices for similar product types or discounted expected cash flows which takes into consideration factors such as future interest rates prepayment speeds default and loss curves and market discount rates the determination of fair value for commercial loans takes into account factors such as the location and appraised value of the related collateral as well as the estimated cash flows from realization of the collateral  mortgage servicing rights  retained rights to service mortgage loans are recognized as a separate and distinct asset at the time the loans are sold mortgage servicing rights msrs are initially recorded at fair value at the time the related loans are sold and subsequently remeasured at each reporting date under either the fair value or amortization method any increase or decrease in fair value of msrs accounted for under the fair value method as well as any amortization andor impairment of msrs recorded under the amortization method is reflected in earnings in the period that the changes occur msrs are subject to interest rate risk in that their fair value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment fair value is determined based upon the application of an income approach valuation model the valuation model maintained by an independent third party incorporates assumptions in estimating future cash flows these assumptions include time decay payoffs and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions the reasonableness of these pricing models is validated on a minimum of a quarterly basis by at least one independent external service broker valuation because the fair values of msrs are significantly impacted by the use of estimates the use of different assumption estimates can result in different estimated fair values of those msrs  contingent liabilities  we are parties to various claims litigation and legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current andor former operations we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a casebycase basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering among other factors the progress of each case or proceeding our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings and the opinions and views of legal counsel litigation exposure represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our control  income taxes  the calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments we have two accruals for income taxes 1 our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal state and local taxing jurisdictions net of any reserve for potential audit issues and any tax refunds and the net receivable balance is reported as a component of accrued income and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 2 our deferred federal and state income tax and related valuation accounts reported as a component of accrued income and other assets represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under gaap and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under federal and state tax law    86    table of contents in the ordinary course of business we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes the effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws we believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements we review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions in addition we rely on various tax opinions recent tax audits and historical experience  from timetotime we engage in business transactions that may affect our tax liabilities where appropriate we have obtained opinions of outside experts and have assessed the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking into account statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position however changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates implementation of new business strategies resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance such changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position and  or results of operations see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  deferred tax assets  at december 31 2014 we had a net federal deferred tax asset of 721 million and a net state deferred tax asset of 453 million a valuation allowance is provided when it is morelikelythannot some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized all available evidence both positive and negative was considered to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence impairment should be recognized our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change if our forecast of taxable income within the carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets such assets may be impaired based on our analysis of both positive and negative evidence and our ability to offset the net deferred tax assets against our forecasted future taxable income there was no impairment of the net deferred tax assets at december 31 2014 for regulatory capital purposes  recent accounting pronouncements and developments  note 2 to consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2014 and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affect financial condition results of operations or liquidity the impacts are discussed in the applicable section of this mdampa and the notes to consolidated financial statements
