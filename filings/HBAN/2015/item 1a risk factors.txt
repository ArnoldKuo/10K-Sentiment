 the bank currently has a written governance framework and associated controls  legislative and regulatory reforms continue to have significant impacts throughout the financial services industry  the doddfrank act enacted in 2010 is complex and broad in scope and several of its provisions are still being implemented the doddfrank act established the cfpb which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services and the financial stability oversight council which has oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk in addition the doddfrank act altered the authority and duties of the federal banking and securities regulatory agencies implemented certain corporate governance requirements for all public companies including financial institutions with regard to executive compensation proxy access by shareholders and certain whistleblower provisions and restricted certain proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks and their affiliates the doddfrank act also required the issuance of numerous implementing regulations many of which have not yet been issued the regulations will continue to take effect over several more years continuing to make it difficult to anticipate the overall impact to us our customers or the financial industry in general  in january 2014 seven final regulations issued by the cfpb including the ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards various mortgage servicing rules a rule expanding the scope of the highcost mortgage provision in the truth in lending act loan originator compensation requirements and appraisal rules became effective and were successfully implemented by huntington on november 20 2013 the cfpb issued its final rule on integrated mortgage disclosures under the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act for which compliance is required by august 1 2015 the cfpb finalized amendments to the integrated mortgage disclosures on january 20 2015 which are also effective on august 1 2015 on october 22 2014 the cfpb finalized minor amendments to the 2013 mortgage rules under the truth in lending act regulation z making certain nonprofits exempt from some servicing rules and the ability to repay rule and allowing a cure period for points and fees in qualified mortgages these changes were effective as of november 3 2014 in addition the cfpb proposed changes to its servicing rules we continue to monitor evaluate and implement these new regulations  throughout 2014 the cfpb has continued its focus on fair lending practices of indirect automobile lenders this focus has led to some lenders acknowledging that the cfpb and department of justice are considering taking public enforcement actions against them for their fair lending practices indirect automobile lenders have also received continuing pressure from the cfpb to limit or eliminate discretionary pricing by dealers finally the cfpb has proposed its larger participant rule for indirect automobile lending which will bring larger nonbank indirect automobile lenders under cfpb supervision  banking regulatory agencies have increasingly over the last few years used their authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to udap by banks under standards developed many years ago by the federal trade commission in order to address practices that may not necessarily fall within the scope of a specific banking or consumer finance law the doddfrank act also gave to the cfpb similar authority to take action in connection with unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices by entities subject to cfpb supervisory or enforcement authority  large bank holding companies and national banks are required to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve and occ respectively and conduct stress tests  the federal reserves regulation y requires large bank holding companies to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and to require such bank holding companies to obtain approval from the federal reserve under certain circumstances before making a capital distribution this rule applies to us and all other bank holding companies with 50 billion or more of total consolidated assets  a large bank holding companys capital plan must include an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over at least the next nine quarters a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon a detailed description of the entitys process for assessing capital adequacy the entitys capital policy and a discussion of any expected changes to the bank holding companys business plan that are likely to have a material impact on the firms capital adequacy or liquidity the planning horizon for the most recent capital planning and stress testing cycle encompasses the 2014 fourth quarter through the 2016 fourth quarter as was submitted in our capital plan in january 2015 rules to implement the basel iii capital reforms in the united states were finalized in july 2013 and will be phasedin by us beginning with 1q 2015 results under the standardized approach as such the most recent    9    table of contents  ccar cycle which began october 1 2014 overlaps with the implementation of the basel iii capital reforms based on the required nine quarter projection horizon in accordance with stress test rules we incorporated the revised capital framework into the capital planning projections and into the stress tests required under the doddfrank act capital adequacy at large banking organizations including us is assessed against a minimum 45 percent tier 1 common ratio and a 5 percent tier 1 leverage ratio as determined by the federal reserve  capital plans for 2015 were required to be submitted by january 5 2015 the federal reserve will either object to a capital plan in whole or in part or provide a notice of nonobjection no later than march 31 2015 for plans submitted by the january 5 2015 submission date if the federal reserve objects to a capital plan the bank holding company may not make any capital distributions other than those with respect to which the federal reserve has indicated its nonobjection while we can give no assurances as to the outcome or specific interactions with the regulators based on the capital plan we submitted on january 5 2015 we believe we have a strong capital position and that our capital adequacy process is robust  in addition to the ccar submission section 165 of the doddfrank act requires that national banks like the huntington national bank conduct annual stress tests for submission in january 2015 the results of the stress tests will provide the occ with forwardlooking information that will be used in bank supervision and will assist the agency in assessing a companys risk profile and capital adequacy we submitted our stress test results to the occ on january 5 2015  the regulatory capital rules indicate that common stockholders equity should be the dominant element within tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on noncommon equity elements under the doddfrank act the ratio of common equity tier 1 to riskweighted assets became significant as a measurement of the predominance of common equity in tier 1 capital and an indication of the quality of capital  conforming covered activities to implement the volcker rule  on december 10 2013 the federal reserve the occ the fdic the cftc and the sec issued final rules to implement the volcker rule contained in section 619 of the doddfrank act and established july 21 2015 as the end of the conformance period section 619 generally prohibits insured depository institutions and any company affiliated with an insured depository institution from engaging in proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining ownership interests in sponsoring or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund these prohibitions are subject to a number of statutory exemptions restrictions and definitions on december 18 2014 the federal reserve board announced it acted under section 619 to give banking entities until july 21 2016 to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to december 31 2013 legacy covered funds the board also announced its intention to act next year to grant banking entities an additional oneyear extension of the conformance period until july 21 2017 to conform ownership interests in and relationships with legacy covered funds the bank continues its good faith efforts to conform with proprietary trading prohibitions and associated compliance requirements the company does not expect volcker compliance to have a material impact on its business model  the volcker rule prohibits an insured depository institution and any company that controls an insured depository institution such as a bank holding company and any of their subsidiaries and affiliates referred to as banking entities from i engaging in proprietary trading and ii investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds covered funds subject to certain limited exceptions these prohibitions impact the ability of us banking entities to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with nonus banking organizations in overseas markets the rule also effectively prohibits shortterm trading strategies by any us banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for trading  the final volcker rule regulations do provide certain exemptions allowing banking entities to continue underwriting marketmaking and hedging activities and trading certain government obligations as well as various exemptions and exclusions from the definition of covered funds the level of required compliance activity depends on the size of the banking entity and the extent of its trading ceos of larger banking entities including huntington will have to attest annually in writing that their organization has in place processes to establish maintain enforce review test and modify compliance with the volcker rule regulations banking entities with significant permitted trading operations will have to report certain quantitative information beginning between june 30 2014 and december 31 2016 depending on the size of the banking entitys trading assets and liabilities  on january 14 2014 the five federal agencies approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of the volcker rule under the interim final rule the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities if certain qualifications are met in addition the agencies released a nonexclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of the interim final rule at december 31 2014 we had investments in nine different pools of trust preferred securities eight of our pools are included in the list of nonexclusive issuers we have analyzed the other pool that was not included on the list and believe that we will continue to be able to own this investment under the final volcker rule regulations    10    table of contents there are restrictions on our ability to pay dividends  dividends from the bank to the parent company are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders however there are statutory limits on the amount of dividends that the bank can pay to the holding company regulatory approval is required prior to the declaration of any dividends in an amount greater than its undivided profits or if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus or common stock the bank is currently able to pay dividends to the holding company subject to these limitations  if in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice such authority may require after notice and hearing that such bank cease and desist from such practice depending on the financial condition of the bank the applicable regulatory authority might deem us to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice if the bank were to pay dividends to the holding company  the federal reserve and the occ have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings additionally the federal reserve may prohibit or limit bank holding companies from making capital distributions including payment of preferred and common dividends as part of the annual capital plan approval process  we are subject to the current capital requirements mandated by the federal reserve and final basel iii capital and liquidity frameworks  the federal reserve sets riskbased capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies under the guidelines and related policies bank holding companies must maintain capital sufficient to meet both a riskbased asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis the riskbased ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet commitments into riskweighted categories with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived as representing greater risk the riskbased ratio represents total capital divided by total riskweighted assets the leverage ratio is core capital divided by total assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines the bank is subject to substantially similar capital requirements  on july 2 2013 the federal reserve voted to adopt final capital rules implementing basel iii requirements for us banking organizations the final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the united states the basel iii regulatory capital reforms from the basel committee on banking supervision and certain changes required by the doddfrank act under the final rule minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations consistent with the international basel framework the final rule includes a new minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital tier 1 common to riskweighted assets and a tier 1 common capital conservation buffer of 25 of riskweighted assets that will apply to all supervised financial institutions the rule also raises the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4 for all banking organizations these new minimum capital ratios were effective for us on january 1 2015 and will be fully phasedin on january 1 2019  the following are the basel iii regulatory capital levels that we must satisfy to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments during the applicable transition period from january 1 2015 until january 1 2019                                basel iii regulatory capital levels        january 12015     january 12016     january 12017     january 12018     january 12019     tier 1 common     45       5125       575       6375       70     tier 1 riskbased capital ratio     60       6625       725       7875       85     total riskbased capital ratio     80       8625       925       9875       105    the final rule emphasizes tier 1 common capital the most lossabsorbing form of capital and implements strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments the final rule also improves the methodology for calculating riskweighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity banks and regulators use risk weighting to assign different levels of risk to different classes of assets  we have evaluated the impact of the basel iii final rule on our regulatory capital ratios and estimate on a fully phasedin basis a reduction of approximately 40 basis points to our basel i tier i common riskbased capital ratio the estimate is based on managements current interpretation expectations and understanding of the final us basel iii rules we anticipate that our capital ratios on a basel iii basis will continue to exceed the wellcapitalized minimum capital requirements we are evaluating options to mitigate the capital impact of the final rule prior to its effective implementation date  based on the final basel iii rule banking organizations with more than 15 billion in total consolidated assets are required to phaseout of additional tier 1 capital any nonqualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred shares issued before september 12 2010 we will begin the additional tier i capital phaseout of our trust preferred securities in 2015 but will be able to include these instruments in tier ii capital as a nonadvanced approaches institution    11    table of contents generally under the currently applicable guidelines a financial institutions capital is divided into two tiers institutions that must incorporate market risk exposure into their riskbased capital requirements may also have a third tier of capital in the form of restricted shortterm subordinated debt these tiers are            tier 1 riskbased capital or core capital which includes total equity plus qualifying capital securities and minority interests subject to phaseout excluding unrealized gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income and nonqualifying intangible and servicing assets            tier 2 riskbased capital or supplementary capital which includes among other things cumulative and limitedlife preferred stock mandatory convertible securities qualifying subordinated debt and the acl up to 125 of riskweighted assets            total riskbased capital is the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 riskbased capital  the federal reserve and the other federal banking regulators require that all intangible assets net of deferred tax except originated or purchased msrs nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships intangible assets be deducted from tier 1 capital however the total amount of these items included in capital cannot exceed 100 of its tier 1 capital  under the general riskbased guidelines to remain adequatelycapitalized financial institutions are required to maintain a total riskbased capital ratio of 8 with 4 being tier 1 riskbased capital the appropriate regulatory authority may set higher capital requirements when they believe an institutions circumstances warrant an increase  under the leverage guidelines financial institutions are required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 3 the minimum ratio is applicable only to financial institutions that meet certain specified criteria including excellent asset quality high liquidity low interest rate risk exposure and the highest regulatory rating financial institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4  failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the financial institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities these include limitations on the ability to pay dividends the issuance by the regulatory authority of a directive to increase capital and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic in addition the financial institution could be subject to the measures described below under prompt corrective action as applicable to undercapitalized institutions  the riskbased capital standards of the federal reserve the occ and the fdic specify that evaluations by the banking agencies of a banks capital adequacy will include an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of a banks capital due to changes in interest rates these banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active oversight of risk management activities by senior management  fdicia requires federal banking regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements for these purposes fdicia establishes five capital tiers wellcapitalized adequatelycapitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized  throughout 2014 our regulatory capital ratios and those of the bank were in excess of the levels established for wellcapitalized institutions an institution is deemed to be wellcapitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of 10 or greater a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 6 or greater and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 5 or greater and is not subject to a regulatory order agreement or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital

table of contents fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a cash dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would become undercapitalized after such payment undercapitalized institutions are also subject to growth limitations and are required by the appropriate federal banking agency to submit a capital restoration plan if any depository institution subsidiary of a holding company is required to submit a capital restoration plan the holding company would be required to provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of such plan  depending upon the severity of the under capitalization the undercapitalized institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequatelycapitalized requirements to reduce total assets cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks and restrictions on making any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming so classified  under fdicia a depository institution that is not wellcapitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market since the bank is wellcapitalized the fdicia brokered deposit rule did not adversely affect its ability to accept brokered deposits the bank had 22 billion of such brokered deposits at december 31 2014  on september 3 2014 the us banking regulators approved a final rule to implement a minimum liquidity coverage ratio lcr requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more and a less stringent modified lcr requirement to depository institution holding companies below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the lcr requires covered banking organizations to maintain hqla equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendarday stress scenario we are covered by the modified lcr requirement and therefore subject to the phasein of the rule beginning january 2016 at 90 and january 2017 at 100 we will also be required to calculate the lcr monthly  as a bank holding company we must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the bank  under the doddfrank act a bank holding company must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and must commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank the federal reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank it may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the federal reserve believes might jeopardize the bank holding companys ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank  any loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy an appointed bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank moreover the bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institutions general unsecured creditors including the holders of its note obligations  federal law permits the occ to order the prorata assessment of shareholders of a national bank whose capital stock has become impaired by losses or otherwise to relieve a deficiency in such national banks capital stock this statute also provides for the enforcement of any such prorata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of capital stock by sale to the extent necessary of the capital stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to pay the assessment as the sole shareholder of the bank we are subject to such provisions  moreover the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expenses and the claims of holders of deposit liabilities of such an institution are accorded priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors of such an institution including the holders of the institutions note obligations in the event of liquidation or other resolution of such institution claims of a receiver for administrative expenses and claims of holders of deposit liabilities of the bank including the fdic as the insurer of such holders would receive priority over the holders of notes and other senior debt of the bank in the event of liquidation or other resolution and over our interests as sole shareholder of the bank  bank transactions with affiliates  federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the banks bank holding company and certain companies the bank holding company may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on armslength terms and cannot exceed certain    13    table of contents  amounts which are determined with reference to the banks regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bank holding company may be required to provide it  provisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of i the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment advisor ii credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and iii transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction they also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july 21 2012 the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them  as a financial holding company we are subject to additional laws and regulations  in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company a bank holding companys depository subsidiaries must all be both wellcapitalized and wellmanaged and must meet their community reinvestment act obligations  financial holding company powers relate to financial activities that are specified in the bank holding company act or determined by the federal reserve in coordination with the secretary of the treasury to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity provided that the complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness risk in addition we are required by the bank holding company act to obtain federal reserve approval prior to acquiring directly or indirectly ownership or control of voting shares of any bank if after such acquisition we would own or control more than 5 of its voting stock furthermore the doddfrank act added a new provision to the bank holding company act which requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than 50 billion to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve to acquire a nondepository company having total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more  we also must comply with antimoney laundering and customer privacy regulations as well as corporate governance accounting and reporting requirements  the usa patriot act of 2001 and its related regulations require insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing federal banking regulators are required when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering activities of the applicants the financial crimes enforcement network has proposed a rule for those same entities and if adopted the proposal will prescribe customer due diligence requirements including a new regulatory mandate to identify the beneficial owners of legal entities which are customers  pursuant to title v of the grammleachbliley act we like all other financial institutions are required to            provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and practices            inform our customers regarding the conditions under which their nonpublic personal information may be disclosed to nonaffiliated third parties and            give our customers an option to prevent certain disclosure of such information to nonaffiliated third parties  the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 imposed new or revised corporate governance accounting and reporting requirements on us in addition to a requirement that chief executive officers and chief financial officers certify financial statements in writing the statute imposed requirements affecting among other matters the composition and activities of audit committees disclosures relating to corporate insiders and insider transactions code of ethics and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting  available information  this

other information about us at the offices of the nasdaq national market at 33 whitehall street new york new york    14    table of contents item 1a risk factors  risk governance  we use a multifaceted approach to risk governance it begins with the board of directors defining our risk appetite as aggregate moderatetolow this does not preclude engagement in select higher risk activities rather the definition is intended to represent an average of where we want our overall risk to be managed  three board committees primarily oversee implementation of this desired risk appetite and monitoring of our risk profile the audit committee risk oversight committee and the technology committee            the audit committee is principally involved with overseeing the integrity of financial statements providing oversight of the internal audit department and selecting our external auditors our chief auditor reports directly to the audit committee chair            the risk oversight committee supervises our risk management processes which primarily cover credit market liquidity operational compliance legal strategic and reputational risks it also approves the charters of executive risk management committees sets risk limits on certain risk measures eg economic value of equity receives results of the risk selfassessment process and routinely engages management in review of key risks our credit review executive reports directly to the risk oversight committee            the technology committee provides oversight of technology to meet defined standards for risk security and companydefined targets and ensure that exposure to security and redundancy risks are defined and transparent and provides oversight of the banks overall third party relationship risk management process  the audit and risk oversight committees routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and risk management on a periodic basis the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both such as the construct and appropriateness of the acl which is reviewed quarterly all directors have access to information provided to each committee and all scheduled meetings are open to all directors  further through its compensation committee the board of directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards is risksensitive and aligns the interests of management creditors and shareholders we utilize a variety of compensationrelated tools to induce appropriate behavior including common stock ownership thresholds for the chief executive officer and certain members of senior management a requirement to hold until retirement or exit from the company a portion of net shares received upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards 50 for executive officers and 25 for other award recipients equity deferrals recoupment provisions and the right to terminate compensation plans at any time  management has implemented an enterprise risk management and risk appetite framework critically important is our selfassessment process in which each business segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls the segment analyses are combined with assessments by our risk management organization of major risk sectors eg credit market liquidity operational reputational compliance etc to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment outcomes of the process include a determination of the quality of the overall control process the direction of risk and our position compared to the defined risk appetite  management also utilizes a wide series of metrics key risk indicators to monitor risk positions throughout the company in general a range for each metric is established which allows the company in aggregate to operate within a moderatetolow risk profile deviations from the range will indicate if the risk being measured is moving which may then necessitate corrective action  we also have four other executive level committees to manage risk alco credit policy and strategy risk management and capital management each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature we believe this structure helps ensure appropriate escalation of issues and overall communication of strategies  huntington utilizes three lines of defense with regard to risk management 1 business segments 2 corporate risk management and 3 internal audit and credit review to induce greater ownership of risk within its business segments segment risk officers have been embedded to identify and monitor risk elevate and remediate issues establish controls perform selftesting and oversee the selfassessment process corporate risk management establishes policies sets operating limits reviews new or modified productsprocesses ensures consistency and quality assurance within the segments and produces the enterprise risk assessment the chief risk officer has significant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans as they apply to risk internal audit and credit review provide additional assurance that riskrelated functions are operating as intended    15    table of contents risk overview  we like other financial companies are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations many of which are outside of our direct control though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns among the risks assumed are 1 credit risk which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms 2 market risk which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads 3 liquidity risk which is a the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external macro market issues investor and customer perception of financial strength and events unrelated to us such as war terrorism or financial institution market specific issues and b the risk of loss based on our ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments due to the mix and maturity structure of our balance sheet amount of onhand cash and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding 4 operational and legal risk which is the risk of loss due to human error inadequate or failed internal systems and controls including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters and security risks and 5 compliance risk which exposes us to money penalties enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws rules and regulations that apply to the financial services industry  we also expend considerable effort to contain risk which emanates from execution of our business strategies and work relentlessly to protect the companys reputation strategic risk and reputational risk do not easily lend themselves to traditional methods of measurement rather we closely monitor them through processes such as new product  initiative reviews frequent financial performance reviews employee and client surveys monitoring market intelligence periodic discussions between management and our board and other such efforts  in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report readers should carefully consider that the following important factors among others could negatively impact our business future results of operations and future cash flows materially  credit risks  1 our acl level may prove to be inappropriate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could materially adversely affect our net income and capital  our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers our acl of 6660 million at december 31 2014 represented managements estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we periodically review our acl for appropriateness in doing so we consider economic conditions and trends collateral values and credit quality indicators such as past chargeoff experience levels of past due loans and npas there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases if the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  in addition bank regulators periodically review our acl and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan chargeoffs any increase in our acl or loan chargeoffs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  2 weakness in economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business  our performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us our customers and our counterparties these conditions could result in one or more of the following            a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us            a decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us and            an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us  an increase in the number of delinquencies bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of npas ncos provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale the markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and thus are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors    16    table of contents market risks  1 changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income reduce transactional income and negatively impact the value of our loans securities and other assets this could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows financial condition results of operations and capital  our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions conditions such as inflation deflation recession unemployment money supply and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates if our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment net interest income could be materially adversely impacted likewise if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment net interest income could be adversely impacted the continuation of the current low interest rate environment could affect consumer and business behavior in ways that are adverse to us and could also constrict our net interest income margin which may restrict our ability to increase net interest income  changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans securities assets under management and other assets including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights an increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in npas and a reduction of income recognized which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows when we place a loan on nonaccrual status we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable which decreases interest income however we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding nals without any corresponding interest income in addition transactional income including trust income brokerage income and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from periodtoperiod based on a number of factors including the interest rate environment  rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixedrate debt securities and cash flow hedging derivatives portfolio any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts oci shareholders equity and the tangible common equity ratio any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios notably tier i and total riskbased capital ratios in a rising interest rate environment pension and other postretirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative oci impacts from securities and financial instruments for more information refer to market risk of the mdampa  certain investment securities notably mortgagebacked securities are very sensitive to rising and falling rates generally when rates rise prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will increase conversely when rates fall prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will decrease in either case interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgagebacked securities investments  liquidity risks  1 changes in either huntingtons financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidence  liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost the bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers the board of directors establishes liquidity policies and limits and management establishes operating guidelines for liquidity our primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers the continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular the availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes eg changes in fdic insurance the liquidity coverage ratio etc and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits while we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding market related geopolitical or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits  2 if we lose access to capital markets we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors creditors and borrowers or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities  wholesale funding sources include securitization federal funds purchased securities sold under repurchase agreements noncore deposits and longterm debt the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank of cincinnati which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgagerelated assets we maintain a portfolio of highlyrated marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity   17    table of contents capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of the bank and corporation the inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations cash flows and level of regulatoryqualifying capital we may from timetotime consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions operational and legal risks  1 we face security risks including denial of service attacks hacking and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information adversely affect our business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure  our computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyberattacks such as denial of service attacks hacking terrorist activities or identity theft financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyberattacks and other means denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions including us none of these events resulted in a breach of our client data or account information however the performance of our website wwwhuntingtoncom was adversely affected and in some instances customers were prevented from accessing our website we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future while events to date primarily resulted in inconvenience future cyberattacks could be more disruptive and damaging hacking and identity theft risks in particular could cause serious reputational harm cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss  despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems we will not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types nor will we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources time and motive the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources including outside groups such as external service providers organized crime affiliates terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applications  even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise targeted social engineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent the successful social engineer will attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients  a successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences including significant disruption of operations misappropriation of confidential information or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties a successful security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to us or to our customers loss of confidence in our security measures significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company  2 the resolution of significant pending litigation if unfavorable could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period  we face legal risks in our businesses and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters if unfavorable may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period  note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements updates the status of litigation concerning cyberco holdings inc although the bank maintains litigation reserves related to this case the ultimate resolution of the matter if unfavorable may be material to our results of operations for a particular reporting period  3 we face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and capital markets  we are exposed to many types of operational risks including the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders unauthorized transactions by employees or outsiders or operational errors by employees huntington executes against a significant number of controls a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and third party service providers there is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack these operational risks could lead to financial loss expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and the capital markets    18    table of contents moreover negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including lending practices corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action  relative to acquisitions we cannot predict if or when we will be able to identify and attract acquisition candidates or make acquisitions on favorable terms we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of acquired institutions in a timely and efficient manner and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies  4 failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and stock price  effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud as a financial holding company we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures such controls and procedures are modified supplemented and changed from timetotime as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments any failure to maintain in the future an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis which could result in regulatory actions loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our business and stock price  5 we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values  quantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including estimating probable loan losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk and for capital planning purposes including during the ccar capital planning and capital adequacy process our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses particularly in times of market distress and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code bad data misuse of data or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the models design  all models have certain limitations reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect missing or misleading information in addition our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable also information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleading  banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate including distributions to our shareholders could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient  compliance risks  1 bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity including the annual ccar assessment process and the basel iii capital and liquidity standards could require higher levels of capital and liquidity among other things these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends repurchase common stock attract costeffective sources of deposits or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securities  the federal reserve administers the annual ccar an assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies with consolidated assets of 50 billion or more and of the practices used by covered banks to assess capital needs under ccar the federal reserve makes a qualitative assessment of capital adequacy on a forwardlooking basis and reviews the strength of a bank holding companys capital adequacy process the federal reserve also makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisoryrun stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a    19    table of contents  tier 1 common ratio of 5 and common equity tier 1 ratio of 45 after making all capital actions included in a bank holding companys capital plan under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a ninequarter planning horizon capital plans for 2015 were required to be submitted by january 5 2015 and the federal reserve will either object to the capital plan andor planned capital actions or provide a notice of nonobjection no later than march 31 2015 we submitted our capital plan to the federal reserve on january 5 2015 there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will respond favorably to our capital plan capital actions or stress test and the federal reserve occ or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including common stock dividends and stock repurchases  on july 2 2013 the federal reserve voted to adopt final basel iii capital rules for us banking organizations the final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the united states the basel iii regulatory capital reforms from the basel committee on banking supervision and certain changes required by the doddfrank act under the final rule minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations as a standardized approach institution the basel iii minimum capital requirements became effective for us on january 1 2015 and will be fully phasedin on january 1 2019  on september 3 2014 the us banking regulators approved a final rule to implement a minimum liquidity coverage ratio lcr requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more and a less stringent modified lcr requirement to depository institution holding companies below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the lcr requires covered banking organizations to maintain hqla equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendarday stress scenario we are covered by the modified lcr requirement and therefore subject to the phasein of the rule beginning january 2016 at 90 and january 2017 at 100 we will also be required to calculate the lcr monthly the lcr assigns less severe outflow assumptions to certain types of customer deposits which should increase the demand and perhaps the cost among banks for these deposits additionally the hqla requirements will increase the demand for direct us government and us government guaranteed debt that while high quality generally carry lower yields than other securities that banks hold in their investment portfolios  2 if our regulators deem it appropriate they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results ability to compete for new business constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends and increase the cost of our services  we are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators including the occ federal reserve fdic sec cfpb financial industry regulatory authority and various state regulatory agencies as such we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations many of which are discussed in the regulatory matters section as part of their supervisory process which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways including monetary fines impacting our ability to pay dividends precluding mergers or acquisitions limiting our ability to offer certain products or services or imposing additional capital requirements  with the development of the cfpb our consumer products and services are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations we may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations enforcement actions and litigation in the future related to consumer practices thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions in addition increased regulatory inquiries and investigations as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments could result in significant loss of revenue require remuneration to our customers trigger fines or penalties limit the products or services we offer require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products impose additional compliance costs on us cause harm to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses  3 legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs adding complexity in doing business impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets requiring us to increase our regulatory capital limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities and otherwise result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operation liquidity or stock price  the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states establishes the cfpb and requires the bureau and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations it is not possible to predict the full extent to which the doddfrank act or the resulting rules and regulations in their entirety will impact our business compliance with these new laws and regulations have and will continue to result in additional costs which could be significant and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations in addition if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to our consumer operations we may be subject to fines penalties or judgments or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses which could adversely affect operations and in turn financial results    20
