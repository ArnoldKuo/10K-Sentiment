islands and another in hong kong  basis of presentation  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of huntington and its majorityowned subsidiaries and are presented in accordance with gaap all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation companies in which huntington holds more than a 50 voting equity interest or a controlling financial interest or are a vie in which huntington i has the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and ii has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie which could potentially be significant to the vie are consolidated vies are legal entities with insubstantial equity whose equity investors lack the ability to make decisions about the entitys activities or whose equity investors do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity if they occur vies in which huntington does not hold the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance or does not have an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie which could potentially be significant to the vie are not consolidated for consolidated entities where huntington holds less than a 100 interest huntington recognizes noncontrolling interest included in shareholders equity for the equity held by others and noncontrolling profit or loss included in noninterest expense for the portion of the entitys earnings attributable to others interests investments in companies that are not consolidated are accounted for using the equity method when huntington has the ability to exert significant influence those investments in nonmarketable securities for which huntington does not have the ability to exert significant influence are generally accounted for using the cost method investments in private investment partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method or the cost method are included in accrued income and other assets and huntingtons proportional interest in the equity investments earnings are included in other noninterest income investment interests accounted for under the cost and equity methods are periodically evaluated for impairment  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that significantly affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements huntington utilizes processes that involve the use of significant estimates and the judgments of management in determining the amount of its allowance for credit losses income taxes deferred tax assets and contingent liabilities as well as fair value measurements of investment securities derivatives goodwill pension mortgage servicing rights and loans held for sale as with any estimate actual results could differ from those estimates  certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation  resale and repurchase agreements  securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest the fair value of collateral either received from or provided to a third party is continually monitored and additional collateral is obtained or is requested to be returned to huntington as in accordance with the agreement  securities  securities purchased with the intention of recognizing shortterm profits or which are actively bought and sold are classified as trading account securities and reported at fair value the unrealized gains or losses on trading account securities are recorded in other noninterest income except for gains and losses on trading account securities used to hedge the fair value of msrs which are included in mortgage banking income debt securities purchased in which huntington has the positive intent and ability to hold to its maturity are classified as heldtomaturity securities heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost all other debt and equity securities are classified as availableforsale and other securities unrealized gains or losses on availableforsale and other securities are reported as a separate component of accumulated oci in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders equity creditrelated declines in the value of debt and marketable equity securities that are considered otherthantemporary are recorded in noninterest income    111    table of contents huntington evaluates its investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis for indicators of otti huntington assesses whether otti has occurred when the fair value of a debt security is less than the amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date management reviews the amount of unrealized loss the length of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position the credit rating history market trends of similar security classes time remaining to maturity and the source of both interest and principal payments to identify securities which could potentially be impaired otti is considered to have occurred 1 if huntington intends to sell the security 2 if it is more likely than not huntington will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 the present value of expected cash flows are not sufficient to recover all contractually required principal and interest payments for securities that huntington does not expect to sell or it is not more likely than not to be required to sell the otti is separated into credit and noncredit components a discounted cash flow analysis which includes evaluating the timing of the expected cash flows is completed for all debt securities subject to credit impairment the measurement of the credit loss component is equal to the difference between the debt securitys cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows discounted at the securitys effective yield the creditrelated otti represented by the expected loss in principal is recognized in noninterest income the remaining difference between the securitys fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not creditrelated and therefore are recognized in oci huntington believes that it will fully collect the carrying value of securities on which noncreditrelated otti has been recognized in oci noncreditrelated otti results from other factors including increased liquidity spreads and extension of the security for securities which huntington does expect to sell or if it is more likely than not huntington will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis all otti is recognized in earnings presentation of otti is made in the consolidated statements of income on a gross basis with a reduction for the amount of otti recognized in oci once an otti is recorded when future cash flows can be reasonably estimated future cash flows are reallocated between interest and principal cash flows to provide for a levelyield on the security  securities transactions are recognized on the trade date the date the order to buy or sell is executed the carrying value plus any related oci balance of sold securities is used to compute realized gains and losses interest and dividends on securities including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the effective interest method over the period to maturity are included in interest income  nonmarketable equity securities include stock acquired for regulatory purposes such as federal home loan bank stock and federal reserve bank stock these securities are accounted for at cost evaluated for impairment and included in availableforsale and other securities   loans and leases  loans and direct financing leases for which huntington has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as loans and leases except for loans which are subject to fair value requirements loans and leases are carried at the principal amount outstanding net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs and net of unearned income direct financing leases are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values net of unearned and deferred income interest income is accrued as earned using the interest method based on unpaid principal balances huntington defers the fees it receives from the origination of loans and leases as well as the direct costs of those activities huntington also acquires loans at a premium and at a discount to their contractual values huntington amortizes loan discounts premiums and net loan origination fees and costs on a levelyield basis over the estimated lives of the related loans  troubled debt restructurings are loans for which the original contractual terms have been modified to provide a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties loan modifications are considered tdrs when the concessions provided are not available to the borrower through either normal channels or other sources however not all loan modifications are tdrs modifications resulting in troubled debt restructurings may include changes to one or more terms of the loan including but not limited to a change in interest rate an extension of the amortization period a reduction in payment amount and partial forgiveness or deferment of principal or accrued interest  residual values on leased automobiles and equipment are evaluated quarterly for impairment impairment of the residual values of direct financing leases determined to be other than temporary is recognized by writing the leases down to fair value with a charge to other noninterest expense residual value losses arise if the expected fair value at the end of the lease term is less than the residual value recorded at the lease origination net of estimated amounts reimbursable by the lessee future declines in the expected residual value of the leased equipment would result in expected losses of the leased equipment  for leased equipment the residual component of a direct financing lease represents the estimated fair value of the leased equipment at the end of the lease term huntington uses industry data historical experience and independent appraisals to establish these residual value estimates additional information regarding product life cycle product upgrades as well as insight into competing products are obtained through relationships with industry contacts and are factored into residual value estimates where applicable  loans held for sale  loans that huntington has the intent to sell or securitize are classified as loans held for sale loans held for sale excluding loans originated or acquired with the intent to sell which are carried at fair value are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell the fair value option was elected for mortgage loans held for sale to facilitate hedging of the loans fair value is determined based on collateral value and prevailing market prices for loans with similar characteristics nonmortgage loans held for sale are measured on an aggregate asset basis    112    table of contents subsequent declines in fair value are recognized either as a chargeoff or as noninterest income depending on the length of time the loan has been recorded as loans held for sale when a decision is made to sell a loan that was not originated or initially acquired with the intent to sell the loan is reclassified into loans held for sale  huntington consolidated an automobile loan securitization in which the associated loan receivables are held at fair value the valuation of the loan receivables and notes payable are evaluated on a quarterly basis with any market value changes recorded in noninterest income the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the automobile loans includes a projection of expected losses and prepayment of the underlying loans in the portfolio and a market assumption of interest rates the notes payable are valued based on interest rates for similar financial assets  allowance for credit losses  huntington maintains two reserves both of which reflect managements judgment regarding the appropriate level necessary to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the alll and the aulc combined these reserves comprise the total acl the determination of the acl requires significant estimates including the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and leases consideration of current economic conditions and historical loss experience pertaining to pools of homogeneous loans and leases all of which may be susceptible to change  the appropriateness of the acl is based on managements current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio these judgments consider ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support further management evaluates the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above additional factors also considered include the impact of declining residential real estate values the diversification of cre loans the development of new or expanded commercial business segments such as healthcare abl and energy and the overall condition of the manufacturing industry also the acl assessment includes the ongoing assessment of credit quality metrics and a comparison of certain acl benchmarks to current performance managements determinations regarding the appropriateness of the acl are reviewed and approved by the companys board of directors  the alll consists of two components 1 the transaction reserve which includes a loan level allocation per asc 31010 specific reserves related to loans considered to be impaired and loans involved in troubled debt restructurings allocated per asc 31040 and 2 the general reserve the transaction reserve component includes both 1 an estimate of loss based on pools of commercial and consumer loans and leases with similar characteristics and 2 an estimate of loss based on an impairment review of each impaired campi and cre loan greater than 10 million for the campi and cre portfolios the estimate of loss based on pools of loans and leases with similar characteristics is made by applying a pd factor and a lgd factor to each individual loan based on a continuously updated loan grade using a standardized loan grading system the pd factor and an lgd factor are determined for each loan grade using statistical models based on historical performance data the pd factor considers ongoing reviews of the financial performance of the specific borrower including cash flow debtservice coverage ratio earnings power debt level and equity position in conjunction with an assessment of the borrowers industry and future prospects the lgd factor considers analysis of the type of collateral and the relative ltv ratio these reserve factors are developed based on credit migration models that track historical movements of loans between loan ratings over time and a combination of longterm average loss experience of our own portfolio and external industry data using a 24month emergence period  in the case of more homogeneous portfolios such as automobile loans home equity loans and residential mortgage loans the determination of the transaction reserve also incorporates pd and lgd factors the estimate of loss is based on pools of loans and leases with similar characteristics the pd factor considers current credit scores unless the account is delinquent in which case a higher pd factor is used the credit score provides a basis for understanding the borrowers past and current payment performance and this information is used to estimate expected losses over the 12month emergence period the performance of firstlien loans ahead of our juniorlien loans is available to use as part of our updated score process the lgd factor considers analysis of the type of collateral and the relative ltv ratio credit scores models analyses and other factors used to determine both the pd and lgd factors are updated frequently to capture the recent behavioral characteristics of the subject portfolios as well as any changes in loss mitigation or credit origination strategies and adjustments to the reserve factors are made as required models utilized in the alll estimation process are subject to the companys model validation policies  the general reserve consists of the economic reserve and riskprofile reserve components the economic reserve component considers the potential impact of changing market and economic conditions on portfolio performance the riskprofile component considers items unique to our structure policies processes and portfolio composition as well as qualitative measurements and assessments of the loan portfolios including but not limited to management quality concentrations portfolio composition industry comparisons and internal review functions    113    table of contents the estimate for the aulc is determined using the same procedures and methodologies as used for the alll the loss factors used in the aulc are the same as the loss factors used in the alll while also considering a historical utilization of unused commitments the aulc is reflected in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets  nonaccrual and past due loans  loans are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due date  any loan in any portfolio may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to the policies described below when collection of principal or interest is in doubt when a borrower with debt is discharged in a chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower the loan is determined to be collateral dependent and placed on nonaccrual status  all classes within the campi and cre portfolios except for purchased creditimpaired loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 90days past due firstlien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 150days past due juniorlien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of 120days past due or when the related firstlien loan has been identified as nonaccrual automobile and other consumer loans are generally chargedoff when the loan is 120days past due residential mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 150days past due with the exception of residential mortgages guaranteed by government agencies which continue to accrue interest at the rate guaranteed by the government agency we are reimbursed from the government agency for reasonable expenses incurred in servicing loans the fha reimburses us for 66 of expenses and the va reimburses us at a maximum percentage of guarantee which is established for each individual loan we have not experienced either material losses in excess of guarantee caps or significant delays or rejected claims from the related government entity  for all classes within all loan portfolios when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status any accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to interest income and prior year amounts chargedoff as a credit loss  for all classes within all loan portfolios cash receipts received on nals are applied against principal until the loan or lease has been collected in full after which time any additional cash receipts are recognized as interest income however for secured nonreaffirmed debt in a chapter 7 bankruptcy payments are applied to principal and interest when the borrower has demonstrated a capacity to continue payment of the debt and collection of the debt is reasonably assured for unsecured nonreaffirmed debt in a chapter 7 bankruptcy where the carrying value has been fully chargedoff payments are recorded as loan recoveries  regarding all classes within the campi and cre portfolios the determination of a borrowers ability to make the required principal and interest payments is based on an examination of the borrowers current financial statements industry management capabilities and other qualitative measures for all classes within the consumer loan portfolio the determination of a borrowers ability to make the required principal and interest payments is based on multiple factors including number of days past due and in some instances an evaluation of the borrowers financial condition when in managements judgment the borrowers ability to make required principal and interest payments resumes and collectability is no longer in doubt the loan is returned to accrual status for these loans that have been returned to accrual status cash receipts are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan  chargeoff of uncollectible loans  any loan in any portfolio may be chargedoff prior to the policies described below if a loss confirming event has occurred loss confirming events include but are not limited to bankruptcy unsecured continued delinquency foreclosure or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency and that asset is the sole source of repayment additionally discharged collateral dependent nonreaffirmed debt in chapter 7 bankruptcy filings will result in a chargeoff to estimated collateral value less anticipated selling costs   campi and cre loans are either chargedoff or written down to net realizable value at 90days past due automobile loans and other consumer loans are chargedoff at 120days past due firstlien and juniorlien home equity loans are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs at 150days past due and 120days past due respectively residential mortgages are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the collateral at 150days past due  impaired loans  for all classes within the campi and cre portfolios all loans with an outstanding balance of 10 million or greater are evaluated on a quarterly basis for impairment generally consumer loans within any class are not individually evaluated on a regular basis for impairment all tdrs regardless of the outstanding balance amount are also considered to be impaired loans acquired with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable at acquisition that all contractually required payments will not be collected are also considered to be impaired  once a loan has been identified for an assessment of impairment the loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected this determination requires significant judgment and use of estimates and the eventual outcome may differ significantly from those estimates    114    table of contents when a loan in any class has been determined to be impaired the amount of the impairment is measured using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or as a practical expedient the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent when the present value of expected future cash flows is used the effective interest rate is the original contractual interest rate of the loan adjusted for any premium or discount when the contractual interest rate is variable the effective interest rate of the loan changes over time a specific reserve is established as a component of the alll when a loan has been determined to be impaired subsequent to the initial measurement of impairment if there is a significant change to the impaired loans expected future cash flows or if actual cash flows are significantly different from the cash flows previously estimated huntington recalculates the impairment and appropriately adjusts the specific reserve similarly if huntington measures impairment based on the observable market price of an impaired loan or the fair value of the collateral of an impaired collateral dependent loan huntington will adjust the specific reserve  when a loan within any class is impaired the accrual of interest income is discontinued unless the receipt of principal and interest is no longer in doubt interest income on tdrs is accrued when all principal and interest is expected to be collected under the postmodification terms cash receipts received on nonaccruing impaired loans within any class are generally applied entirely against principal until the loan has been collected in full after which time any additional cash receipts are recognized as interest income cash receipts received on accruing impaired loans within any class are applied in the same manner as accruing loans that are not considered impaired  purchased creditimpaired loans  purchased loans with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable at acquisition that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are considered to be credit impaired purchased creditimpaired loans are initially recorded at fair value which is estimated by discounting the cash flows expected to be collected at the acquisition date because the estimate of expected cash flows reflects an estimate of future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loans an allowance for credit losses is not recorded at the acquisition date the excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value referred to as the accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans on a levelyield basis the difference between the contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference a subsequent decrease in the estimate of cash flows expected to be received on purchased creditimpaired loans generally results in the recognition of an allowance for credit losses subsequent increases in cash flows result in reversal of any nonaccretable difference or allowance for loan and lease losses to the extent any has been recorded with a positive impact on interest income subsequently recognized the measurement of cash flows involves assumptions and judgments for interest rates prepayments default rates loss severity and collateral values all of these factors are inherently subjective and significant changes in the cash flow estimates over the life of the loan can result  transfers of financial assets and securitizations  transfers of financial assets in which we have surrendered control over the transferred assets are accounted for as sales in assessing whether control has been surrendered we consider whether the transferee would be a consolidated affiliate the existence and extent of any continuing involvement in the transferred financial assets and the impact of all arrangements or agreements made contemporaneously with or in contemplation of the transfer even if they were not entered into at the time of transfer control is generally considered to have been surrendered when i the transferred assets have been legally isolated from us or any of our consolidated affiliates even in bankruptcy or other receivership ii the transferee or if the transferee is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization or assetbacked financing that is constrained from pledging or exchanging the assets it receives each thirdparty holder of its beneficial interests has the right to pledge or exchange the assets or beneficial interests it received without any constraints that provide more than a trivial benefit to us and iii neither we nor our consolidated affiliates and agents have a both the right and obligation under any agreement to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets before their maturity b the unilateral ability to cause the holder to return specific financial assets that also provides us with a morethantrivial benefit other than through a cleanup call or c an agreement that permits the transferee to require us to repurchase the transferred assets at a price so favorable that it is probable that it will require us to repurchase them  if the sale criteria are met the transferred financial assets are removed from our balance sheet and a gain or loss on sale is recognized if the sale criteria are not met the transfer is recorded as a secured borrowing in which the assets remain on our balance sheet and the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a liability for the majority of financial asset transfers it is clear whether or not we have surrendered control for other transfers such as in connection with complex transactions or where we have continuing involvement we generally obtain a legal opinion as to whether the transfer results in a true sale by law  we have historically securitized certain automobile receivables gains and losses on the loans and leases sold and servicing rights associated with loan and lease sales are determined when the related loans or leases are sold to either a securitization trust or third party for loan or lease sales with servicing retained a servicing asset is recorded at fair value for the right to service the loans sold  derivative financial instruments  a variety of derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps caps floors and collars are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements these instruments provide flexibility in adjusting huntingtons sensitivity to changes in interest rates without exposure to loss of principal and higher funding requirements    115    table of contents huntington also uses derivatives principally loan sale commitments in hedging its mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and its mortgage loans held for sale mortgage loan sale commitments and the related interest rate lock commitments are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking revenue huntington also uses certain derivative financial instruments to offset changes in value of its msrs these derivatives consist primarily of forward interest rate agreements and forward mortgage contracts the derivative instruments used are not designated as hedges accordingly such derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking income  derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities respectively and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into we designate it as either            a qualifying hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge            a qualifying hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset liability or forecasted transaction cash flow hedge or            a trading instrument or a nonqualifying economic hedge  changes in the fair value of a derivative that has been designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period earnings changes in the fair value of a derivative that has been designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge to the extent effective as a hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of income taxes and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged item affects earnings ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship is reflected in current period earnings changes in the fair value of derivatives held for trading purposes or which do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in current period earnings  for those derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied huntington formally documents the hedging relationship and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge this documentation identifies the hedging instrument the hedged item or transaction the nature of the risk being hedged and unless the hedge meets all of the criteria to assume there is no ineffectiveness the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging instrument and how ineffectiveness will be measured the methods utilized to assess retrospective hedge effectiveness as well as the frequency of testing vary based on the type of item being hedged and the designated hedge period for specifically designated fair value hedges of certain fixedrate debt huntington utilizes the shortcut method when certain criteria are met for other fair value hedges of fixedrate debt including certificates of deposit huntington utilizes the regression method to evaluate hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis for fair value hedges of portfolio loans the regression method is used to evaluate effectiveness on a daily basis for cash flow hedges the regression method is applied on a quarterly basis  hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when            the derivative is no longer effective or expected to be effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item including firm commitments or forecasted transactions            the derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercised            it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur            the hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment or            the designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is removed  when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value or cash flow hedge the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value  in the case of a discontinued fair value hedge of a recognized asset or liability as long as the hedged item continues to exist on the balance sheet the hedged item will no longer be adjusted for changes in fair value the basis adjustment that had previously been recorded to the hedged item during the period from the hedge designation date to the hedge discontinuation date is recognized as an adjustment to the yield of the hedged item over the remaining life of the hedged item  in the case of a discontinued cash flow hedge of a recognized asset or liability as long as the hedged item continues to exist on the balance sheet the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the hedging derivative will no longer be recorded to other comprehensive income the balance applicable to the discontinued hedging relationship will be recognized in earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item as an adjustment to yield if the discontinued hedged item was a forecasted transaction that is not expected to occur any amounts recorded on the balance sheet related to the hedged item including any amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified to current period earnings    116    table of contents in the case of either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge if the previously hedged item is sold or extinguished the basis adjustment to the underlying asset or liability or any remaining unamortized other comprehensive income balance will be reclassified to current period earnings  in all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued the derivative will be carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings unless redesignated as a qualifying hedge  like other financial instruments derivatives contain an element of credit risk which is the possibility that huntington will incur a loss because the counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations notional values of interest rate swaps and other offbalance sheet financial instruments significantly exceed the credit risk associated with these instruments and represent contractual balances on which calculations of amounts to be exchanged are based credit exposure is limited to the sum of the aggregate fair value of positions that have become favorable to huntington including any accrued interest receivable due from counterparties potential credit losses are mitigated through careful evaluation of counterparty credit standing selection of counterparties from a limited group of high quality institutions collateral agreements and other contract provisions huntington considers the value of collateral held and collateral provided in determining the net carrying value of derivatives  huntington offsets the fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and the fair value for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement  repossessed collateral  repossessed collateral also referred to as other real estate owned oreo is comprised principally of commercial and residential real estate properties obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations and is carried at the lower of cost or fair value collateral obtained in satisfaction of a loan is recorded at the estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs based upon the propertys appraised value at the date of foreclosure with any difference between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of the loan recorded as a chargeoff subsequent declines in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are recorded in noninterest expense gains or losses resulting from the sale of collateral are recognized in noninterest expense at the date of sale  collateral  we pledge assets as collateral as required for various transactions involving security repurchase agreements public deposits loan notes derivative financial instruments shortterm borrowings and longterm borrowings assets that have been pledged as collateral including those that can be sold or repledged by the secured party continue to be reported on our consolidated balance sheets  we also accept collateral primarily as part of various transactions involving security resale agreements collateral accepted by us including collateral that we can sell or repledge is excluded from our consolidated balance sheets  the market value of collateral we have accepted or pledged is regularly monitored and additional collateral is obtained or provided as necessary to ensure appropriate collateral coverage in these transactions   premises and equipment  premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is computed principally by the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets buildings and building improvements are depreciated over an average of 30 to 40 years and 10 to 30 years respectively land improvements and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over an average of 5 to 20 years while equipment is depreciated over a range of 3 to 10 years leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the assets useful life or the lease term including any renewal periods for which renewal is reasonably assured maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred while improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life premises and equipment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  mortgage servicing rights  huntington recognizes the rights to service mortgage loans as separate assets which are included in accrued income and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets only when purchased or when servicing is contractually separated from the underlying mortgage loans by sale or securitization of the loans with servicing rights retained  for loan sales with servicing retained a servicing asset is recorded at fair value for the right to service the loans sold to determine the fair value of a msr huntington uses an option adjusted spread cash flow analysis incorporating market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and market interest rates the forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for us dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments the current and projected mortgage interest rate influences the prepayment rate and therefore the timing and magnitude of the cash flows associated with the msr expected mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are derived from a third party model management believes these prepayment assumptions are consistent with assumptions used by other market participants valuing similar msrs the servicing rights are recorded in accrued income and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets servicing revenues on mortgage loans are included in mortgage banking income    117    table of contents at the time of initial capitalization msrs may be grouped into servicing classes based on the availability of market inputs used in determining fair value and the method used for managing the risks of the servicing assets msr assets are recorded using the fair value method or the amortization method the election of the fair value or amortization method is made at the time each servicing class is established all newly created msrs since 2009 were recorded using the amortization method any change in the fair value of msrs carried under the fair value method as well as amortization and impairment of msrs under the amortization method during the period is recorded in mortgage banking income which is reflected in the consolidated statements of income huntington hedges the value of certain msrs using derivative instruments and trading securities changes in fair value of these derivatives and trading account securities are reported as a component of mortgage banking income  goodwill and other intangible assets  under the acquisition method of accounting the net assets of entities acquired by huntington are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition the excess cost of the acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill other intangible assets are amortized either on an accelerated or straightline basis over their estimated useful lives goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis at october 1st of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  pension and other postretirement benefits  we recognize the funded status of the postretirement benefit plans on the consolidated balance sheets net postretirement benefit cost charged to current earnings related to these plans is based on various actuarial assumptions regarding expected future experience  certain employees are participants in various defined contribution and other nonqualified supplemental retirement plans our contributions to these plans are charged to current earnings  in addition we maintain a 401k plan covering substantially all employees employer contributions to the plan which are charged to current earnings are based on employee contributions  sharebased compensation  we use the fair value based method of accounting for awards of hban stock granted to employees under various stock option and restricted share plans stock compensation costs are recognized prospectively for all new awards granted under these plans compensation expense relating to share options is calculated using a methodology that is based on the underlying assumptions of the blackscholes option pricing model and is charged to expense over the requisite service period eg vesting period compensation expense relating to restricted stock awards is based upon the fair value of the awards on the date of grant and is charged to earnings over the requisite service period eg vesting period of the award  stock repurchases  acquisitions of huntington stock are recorded at cost the reissuance of shares is recorded at weightedaverage cost  income taxes  income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method accordingly deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future book and tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income at the time of enactment of such change in tax rates any interest or penalties due for payment of income taxes are included in the provision for income taxes to the extent that we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is recorded all positive and negative evidence is reviewed when determining how much of a valuation allowance is recognized on a quarterly basis in determining the requirements for a valuation allowance sources of possible taxable income are evaluated including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards taxable income in appropriate carryback years and taxplanning strategies huntington applies a more likely than not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties huntington reviews the tax positions quarterly  bank owned life insurance  huntingtons bank owned life insurance policies are carried at their cash surrender value huntington recognizes taxexempt income from the periodic increases in the cash surrender value of these policies and from death benefits a portion of the cash surrender value is supported by holdings in separate accounts book value protection for the separate accounts is provided by the insurance carriers and a highly rated major bank     118    table of contents fair value measurements  the company records or discloses certain of its assets and liabilities at fair value fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date fair value measurements are classified within one of three levels in a valuation hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date the three levels are defined as follows  level 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets  level 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument  level 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement  a financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement  segment results  accounting policies for the business segments are the same as those used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements with respect to activities specifically attributable to each business segment however the preparation of business segment results requires management to establish methodologies to allocate funding costs and benefits expenses and other financial elements to each business segment changes are made in these methodologies as appropriate  statement of cash flows  cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and due from banks which includes amounts on deposit with the federal reserve and federal funds sold and securities purchased

determining an appropriate acl level for these loans huntington utilizes the following categories of credit grades  pass  higher quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories described below  olem  the credit risk may be relatively minor yet represent a risk given certain specific circumstances if the potential weaknesses are not monitored or mitigated the loan may weaken or the collateral may be inadequate to protect huntingtons position in the future for these reasons huntington considers the loans to be potential problem loans  substandard  inadequately protected loans by the borrowers ability to repay equity andor the collateral pledged to secure the loan these loans have identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt it is likely huntington will sustain some loss if any identified weaknesses are not mitigated  doubtful  loans that have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as substandard with the added elements of the full collection of the loan is improbable and that the possibility of loss is high  the categories above which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions are assigned upon initial approval of the loan or lease and subsequently updated as appropriate  commercial loans categorized as olem substandard or doubtful are considered criticized loans commercial loans categorized as substandard or doubtful are also considered classified loans  for all classes within all consumer loan portfolios each loan is assigned a specific pd factor that is partially based on the borrowers

credit bureau score is widely accepted as the standard measure of consumer credit risk used by lenders regulators rating agencies and consumers the higher the fico credit bureau score the higher likelihood of repayment and therefore an indicator of higher credit quality  huntington assesses the risk in the loan portfolio by utilizing numerous risk characteristics the classifications described

per the restructured loan terms and no loss is expected  commercial nonaccrual tdrs result from either 1 an accruing commercial tdr being placed on nonaccrual status or 2 a workout where an existing commercial nal is restructured and a concession was given at times these workouts restructure the nal so that two or more new notes are created the primary note is underwritten based upon our normal underwriting standards and is sized so projected cash flows are sufficient to repay contractual principal and interest the terms on the secondary notes vary by situation and may include notes that defer principal and interest payments until after the primary note is repaid creating two or more notes often allows the borrower to continue a project or weather a temporary economic downturn and allows huntington to rightsize a loan based upon the current expectations for a borrowers or projects performance    133    table of contents our strategy involving tdr borrowers includes working with these borrowers to allow them to refinance elsewhere as well as allow them time to improve their financial position and remain our customer through refinancing their notes according to market terms and conditions in the future a refinancing or modification of a loan occurs when either the loan matures according to the terms of the tdrmodified agreement or the borrower requests a change to the loan agreements at that time the loan is evaluated to determine if it is creditworthy it is subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing  in accordance with asc 3102035 the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan a new loan is considered for removal of the tdr designation whereas a continuation of the prior note requires a continuation of the tdr designation in order for a tdr designation to be removed the borrower must no longer be experiencing financial difficulties and the terms of the refinanced loan must not represent a concession residential mortgage loan tdrs  residential mortgage tdrs represent loan modifications associated with traditional firstlien mortgage loans in which a concession has been provided to the borrower the primary concessions given to residential mortgage borrowers are amortization or maturity date changes and interest rate reductions residential mortgages identified as tdrs involve borrowers unable to refinance their mortgages through the companys normal mortgage origination channels or through other independent sources some but not all of the loans may be delinquent  automobile home equity and other consumer loan tdrs  the company may make similar interest rate term and principal concessions as with residential mortgage loan tdrs  tdr impact on credit quality  huntingtons alll is largely driven by updated risk ratings assigned to commercial loans updated borrower credit scores on consumer loans and borrower delinquency history in both the commercial and consumer portfolios these updated risk ratings and credit scores consider the default history of the borrower including payment redefaults as such the provision for credit losses is impacted primarily by changes in borrower payment performance rather than the tdr classification tdrs can be classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans nonaccrual tdrs are included in nals whereas accruing tdrs are excluded from nals as it is probable that all contractual principal and interest due under the restructured terms will be collected  our tdrs may include multiple concessions and the disclosure classifications are presented based on the primary concession provided to the borrower the majority of our concessions for the campi and cre portfolios are the extension of the maturity date coupled with an increase in the interest rate in these instances the primary concession is the maturity date extension  tdr concessions may also result in the reduction of the alll within the campi and cre portfolios this reduction is derived from payments and the resulting application of the reserve calculation within the alll the transaction reserve for nontdr campi and cre loans is calculated based upon several estimated probability factors such as pd and lgd both of which were previously discussed above upon the occurrence of a tdr in our campi and cre portfolios the reserve is measured based on discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less selling costs of the modified loan in accordance with asc 31010 the resulting tdr alll calculation often results in a lower alll amount because 1 the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less selling costs indicate a lower estimated loss 2 if the modification includes a rate increase the discounting of the cash flows on the modified loan using the premodification interest rate exceeds the carrying value of the loan or 3 payments may occur as part of the modification the alll for campi and cre loans may increase as a result of the modification as the discounted cash flow analysis may indicate additional reserves are required  tdr concessions on consumer loans may increase the alll the concessions made to these borrowers often include interest rate reductions and therefore the tdr alll calculation results in a greater alll compared with the nontdr calculation as the reserve is measured based on the estimation of the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less selling costs on the modified loan in accordance with asc 31010 the resulting tdr alll calculation often results in a higher alll amount because 1 the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less selling costs indicate a higher estimated loss or 2 due to the rate decrease the discounting of the cash flows on the modified loan using the premodification interest rate indicates a reduction in the expected cash flows or collateral value less selling costs in certain instances the alll may decrease as a result of payments made in connection with the modification  commercial loan tdrs  in instances where the bank substantiates that it will collect its outstanding balance in full the note is considered for return to accrual status upon the borrower sustaining sufficient cash flows for a sixmonth period of time this sixmonth period could extend before or after the restructure date if a chargeoff was taken as part of the restructuring any interest or principal payments received on that note are applied to first reduce the banks outstanding book balance and then to recoveries of chargedoff principal unpaid interest andor fee expenses    134    table of contents residential mortgage automobile home equity and other consumer loan tdrs  modified loans identified as tdrs are aggregated into pools for analysis cash flows and weighted average interest rates are used to calculate impairment at the pooledloan level once the loans are aggregated into the pool they continue to be classified as tdrs until contractually repaid or chargedoff  residential mortgage loans not guaranteed by a us government agency such as the fha va and the usda including tdr loans are reported as accrual or nonaccrual based upon delinquency status nonaccrual tdrs are those that are greater than 150days contractually past due loans guaranteed by us government organizations continue to accrue interest upon delinquency  the following table presents by class and by the reason for the modification the number of contracts postmodification

subtracting from this default breakage percentage both total current and expected future default percentages  security impairment  huntington evaluates its availableforsale securities portfolio on a quarterly basis for indicators of otti huntington assesses whether otti has occurred when the fair value of a debt security is less than the amortized cost basis at periodend management reviews the amount of unrealized loss the length of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position the credit rating history market trends of similar security classes time remaining to maturity and the source of both interest and principal payments to identify securities which could potentially be impaired otti is considered to have occurred 1 if huntington intends to sell the security 2 if it is more likely than not huntington will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 the present value of the expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover all contractually required principal and interest payments  for securities that huntington does not expect to sell and it is not more likely than not to be required to sell the otti is separated into credit and noncredit components a discounted cash flow analysis which includes evaluating the timing of the expected cash flows is completed for all debt securities subject to credit impairment the measurement of the credit loss component is equal to the difference between the debt securitys cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows discounted at the securitys original effective yield the creditrelated otti represented by the expected loss in principal is recognized in noninterest income the remaining difference between the securitys fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not creditrelated and therefore are recognized in oci huntington believes that it will fully collect the carrying value of securities on which noncreditrelated otti has been recognized in oci noncreditrelated otti results from other factors including increased liquidity spreads and extension of the security for securities which huntington does expect to sell or if it is more likely than not huntington will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis all otti is recognized in earnings presentation of otti is made in the consolidated statements of income on a gross basis with a reduction for the amount of otti recognized in oci once an otti is recorded when future cash flows can be reasonably estimated future cash flows are reallocated between interest and principal cash flows to provide for a levelyield on the security    142    table of contents huntington applied the related otti guidance on the debt security types listed below  alta mortgagebacked and privatelabel cmo securities are collateralized by firstlien residential mortgage loans the securities are valued by a third party pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and proprietary pricing model the model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds losses recoveries default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities collateral structure types and house price depreciation  appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts  pooledtrustpreferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio a third party pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooledtrustpreferred security evaluations is engaged to provide assistance estimating the fair value and expected cash flows on this portfolio the full cash flow analysis is completed by evaluating the relevant credit and structural aspects of each pooledtrustpreferred security in the portfolio including collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in the security and terms of the securitys structure the credit review includes an analysis of profitability credit quality operating efficiency leverage and liquidity using available financial and regulatory information for each underlying collateral issuer the analysis also includes a review of historical industry default data currentnear term operating conditions and the impact of macroeconomic and regulatory changes using the results of our analysis we estimate appropriate default and recovery probabilities for each piece of collateral then estimate the expected cash flows for each security the cumulative probability of default ranges from a low of 1 to 100 many collateral issuers have the option of deferring interest payments on their debt for up to five years for issuers who are deferring interest assumptions are made regarding the issuers ability to resume interest payments and make the required principal payment at maturity the cumulative probability of default for these issuers currently ranges from 1 to 100 and a 10 recovery assumption the fair value of each security is obtained by discounting the expected cash flows at a market discount rate ranging from libor plus 425 to libor plus 1625 as of december 31 2012 the market discount rate is determined by reference to yields observed in the market for similarly rated collateralized debt obligations specifically highyield collateralized loan obligations the relatively high market discount rate is reflective of the uncertainty of the cash flows and illiquid nature of these securities the large differential between the fair value and amortized cost of some of the securities reflects the high market discount rate and the expectation that the majority of the cash flows will not be received until near the final maturity of the security the final maturities range from 2032

with readily observable prices while sales of msrs occur the precise terms and conditions are typically not readily available therefore the fair value of msrs is estimated using a discounted future cash flow model the model considers portfolio characteristics contractually specified servicing fees and assumptions related to prepayments delinquency rates late charges other ancillary revenues costs to service and other economic factors changes in the assumptions used may have a significant impact on the valuation of msrs  msr values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be greatly impacted by the level of prepayments huntington hedges the value of certain msrs against changes in value attributable to changes in interest rates using a combination of derivative instruments and trading securities  for msrs under the fair value method a

reflected in accrued income and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets  huntington has retained servicing responsibilities on sold automobile loans and receives annual servicing fees and other ancillary fees on the outstanding loan balances automobile loan servicing rights are accounted for using the amortization method a servicing asset is established at fair value at the time of the sale using a discounted future cash flow model the model considers assumptions related to actual servicing income adequate compensation for servicing and other ancillary fees the servicing asset is then amortized against servicing income impairment if any is recognized when carrying value exceeds the fair value as determined by calculating the present value of expected net future cash flows the primary risk characteristic for measuring servicing assets is payoff rates of the underlying loan pools valuation calculations rely on the predicted payoff assumption and if actual payoff is quicker than expected then future value would be impaired  changes in the carrying value of automobile loan servicing rights for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 and the fair value at the end of each

deferred tax asset related to loss and other carryforwards was 2152 million this was comprised of federal net operating loss carryforwards of 270 million which will begin expiring in 2023 866 million of state net operating loss carryforward which will begin expiring in 2015 an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of 501 million which may be carried forward indefinitely a general business credit carryover of 477 million which will begin expiring in 2027 a capital loss carryforward of 30 million which will expire in 2015 and a charitable contribution carryforward of 08 million which will expire in 2016 a valuation allowance of 30 million has been established for the capital loss carryforward because management believes that it is more likely than not that the realization of this asset will not occur the valuation allowance on this capital loss carryforward decreased 205 million compared with 2011 from the utilization and expiration of capital loss carryforwards  in prior periods huntington established a full valuation allowance against state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards based on the uncertainty of forecasted state taxable income expected in applicable jurisdictions in order to utilize the state deferred tax asset and net operating loss carryforwards based on current analysis of both positive and negative evidence and projected forecasted state taxable income the company believes that it is more likely than not that a portion of the state deferred tax asset and state net operating loss carryforwards will be realized as a result of this analysis a valuation allowance of 327 was adjusted for the portion of the deferred tax asset and state net operating loss carryforwards the company expects to realize    158    table of contents a valuation allowance of 648 million remains for certain state deferred tax assets state net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryfowards that are not expected to be realized within the carryforward periods in managements opinion the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net operating loss alternative minimum tax credit carryforward charitable contribution carryforward and general business credit carryforward consequently huntington determined that a valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets was not required as of december 31 2012  18 benefit plans  huntington sponsors the plan a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees hired or rehired prior to january 1 2010 the plan provides benefits based upon length of service and compensation levels the funding policy of huntington is to contribute an annual amount that is at least equal to the minimum funding requirements but not more than the amount deductible under the internal revenue code although not required huntington made a 75 million contribution to the plan in the third quarter of 2012  in addition huntington has an unfunded defined benefit postretirement plan that provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees who have attained the age of 55 and have at least 10 years of vesting service under this plan for any employee retiring on or after january 1 1993 postretirement healthcare benefits are based upon the employees number of months of service and are limited to the actual cost of coverage life insurance benefits are a percentage of the employees base salary at the time of retirement with a maximum of 50000 of coverage the employer paid portion of the postretirement health and life insurance plan was eliminated for employees retiring on and after march 1 2010 eligible employees retiring on and after march 1 2010 who elect retiree medical coverage will pay the full cost of this coverage huntington will not provide any employer paid life insurance to employees retiring on and after march 1 2010 eligible employees will be able to convert or port their existing life insurance at their own expense under the same terms that are available to all terminated employees  the following table shows the weightedaverage assumptions used to

classified as level 1 within the fair value hierarchy except for corporate obligations us government obligations and us government agencies which are classified as level 2 in general investments of the plan are exposed to various risks such as interest rate risk credit risk and overall market volatility due to the level of risk associated with certain investments it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of investments will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the plan assets  the investment objective of the plan is to maximize the return on plan assets over a long time period while meeting the plan obligations at december 31 2012 plan assets were invested less than 1 in cash and cash equivalents 55 in equity investments and 44 in bonds with an average duration of 120 years on bond investments the estimated life of benefit obligations was 14 years although it may fluctuate with market conditions management has targeted a longterm allocation of plan assets of 20 to 50 in equity investments and 80 to 50 in bond investments the allocation of plan assets between equity investments and fixed income investments will change from time to time with the allocation to fixed income investments increasing as the funding level increases    161    table of contents the following table shows the number of

choose to make a cash contribution to the plan up to the maximum deductible limit in the 2013 plan year anticipated contributions for 2013 to the postretirement benefit plan are 31 million  the assumed healthcare cost trend rate has an effect on the amounts reported a one percentage point increase would decrease service and interest costs and the postretirement benefit obligation by less than 001million and 001 million respectively a one percentage point decrease would increase service and interest costs and the postretirement benefit obligation by less than 001 million and 002 million respectively  the 2013 and 2012 healthcare cost trend rate was projected to be 77 for pre65 aged participants and 82 for post65 aged participants these rates are assumed to decrease gradually until they reach 45 for both pre65 aged participants and post65 aged participants in the year 2028 and remain at that level thereafter huntington updated the immediate healthcare cost trend rate assumption based on current market data and huntingtons claims experience this trend rate is expected to decline over time to a trend level consistent with medical inflation and longterm economic assumptions  huntington also sponsors other retirement plans the most significant being the supplemental executive retirement plan and the supplemental retirement income plan these plans are nonqualified plans that provide certain current and former officers and directors of huntington and its subsidiaries with defined pension benefits in excess of limits imposed by federal tax law at

fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date a threelevel valuation hierarchy was established for disclosure of fair value measurements the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date the three levels are defined as follows  level 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets  level 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument  level 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement  a financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement transfers in and out of level 1 2 or 3 are recorded at fair value at the beginning of the reporting period  following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy  mortgage loans held for sale  huntington elected to apply the fair value option for mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell which are included in loans held for sale mortgage loans held for sale are classified as level 2 and are estimated using security prices for similar product types  availableforsale securities and trading account securities  securities accounted for at fair value include both the availableforsale and trading portfolios huntington uses prices obtained from third party pricing services and recent trades to determine the fair value of securities afs and trading securities are classified as level 1 using quoted market prices unadjusted in active markets for identical securities that huntington has the ability to access at the measurement date 1 of the positions in these portfolios are level 1 and consist of us treasury securities and money market mutual funds when quoted market prices are not available fair values are classified as level 2 using quoted prices for similar assets in active markets quoted prices of identical or similar assets in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 96 of the positions in these portfolios are level 2 and consist of us government and agency debt securities agency mortgage backed securities assetbacked securities municipal securities and other securities for both level 1 and level 2 securities management uses various methods and techniques to corroborate prices obtained from the pricing service including reference to dealer or other market quotes and by reviewing valuations of comparable instruments if relevant market prices are limited or unavailable valuations may require significant management judgment or estimation to determine fair value in which case the fair values are classified as level 3 3 of our positions are level 3 and consist of nonagency alta assetbacked securities privatelabel cmo securities pooledtrustpreferred cdo securities and municipal securities a significant change in the unobservable inputs for these securities may result in a significant change in the ending fair value measurement of these securities    164    table of contents the alta private label cmo and pooledtrustpreferred securities portfolios are classified as level 3 and as such use significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the alta and private label cmo securities portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows while the cash flows of the pooledtrustpreferred securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties and are used as a basis for impairment analysis  alta mortgagebacked and privatelabel cmo securities are collateralized by firstlien residential mortgage loans the securities valuation methodology incorporates values obtained from a third party pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and a proprietary pricing model and includes assumptions management believes market participants would use to value the securities under current market conditions the model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds losses recoveries default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures house price depreciation  appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts and discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities with similar collateral structures  pooledtrustpreferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio we engage a third party pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooledtrustpreferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio the pd of each issuer and the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value management evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the third party pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter actual defaults and deferrals in the current period and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with asc 820  huntington utilizes the same processes to determine the fair value of investment securities classified as heldtomaturity for impairment evaluation purposes  automobile loans  effective january 1 2010 huntington consolidated an automobile loan securitization that previously had been accounted for as an offbalance sheet transaction as a result huntington elected to account for the automobile loan receivables and the associated notes payable at fair value per guidance supplied in asc 825 the automobile loan receivables are classified as level 3 the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the automobile loan receivables included projections of expected losses and prepayment of the underlying loans in the portfolio and a market assumption of interest rate spreads certain interest rates are available from similarly traded securities while other interest rates are developed internally based on similar assetbacked security transactions in the market  msrs  msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices accordingly the fair value of these assets is classified as level 3 huntington determines the fair value of msrs using an income approach model based upon our monthend interest rate curve and prepayment assumptions the model which is operated and maintained by a third party utilizes assumptions to estimate future net servicing income cash flows including estimates of time decay payoffs and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions servicing brokers and other sources of information eg discussion with other mortgage servicers and industry surveys are used to obtain information on market practice and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis third party marks are obtained from at least one service broker huntington reviews the valuation assumptions against this market data for reasonableness and adjusts the assumptions if deemed appropriate any recommended change in assumptions and  or inputs are presented for review to the mortgage price risk subcommittee for final approval  derivatives  derivatives classified as level 1 consist of exchange traded options and forward commitments to deliver mortgagebacked securities which are valued using quoted prices asset and liability conversion swaps and options and interest rate caps are classified as level 2 these derivative positions are valued using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates current market interest rates derivatives classified as level 3 consist primarily of interest rate lock agreements related to mortgage loan commitments the determination of fair value includes assumptions related to the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan which is a significant unobservable assumption a significant increase or decrease in the external market price would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement    165    table of contents securitization trust notes payable  consists of certain securitization trust notes payable related to the automobile loan receivables measured at fair value the notes payable are classified as level 2 and are valued based on interest rates for similar financial instruments  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a

discussion below  a significant change in the unobservable inputs may result in a significant change in the ending fair value measurement of level 3 instruments in general prepayment rates increase when market interest rates decline and decrease when market interest rates rise and higher prepayment rates generally result in lower fair values for msr assets privatelabel cmo securities assetbacked securities and automobile loans  credit loss estimates such as probability of default constant default cumulative default loss given default cure given deferral and loss severity are driven by the ability of the borrowers to pay their loans and the value of the underlying collateral and are impacted by changes in macroeconomic conditions typically increasing when economic conditions worsen and decreasing when conditions improve an increase in the estimated prepayment rate typically results in a decrease in estimated credit losses and vice versa higher credit loss estimates generally result in lower fair values credit spreads generally increase when liquidity risks and market volatility increase and decrease when liquidity conditions and market volatility improve  discount rates and spread over forward interest rate swap rates typically increase when market interest rates increase andor credit and liquidity risks increase and decrease when market interest rates decline andor credit and liquidity conditions improve higher discount rates and credit spreads generally result in lower fair market values  net market price and pull through percentages generally increase when

assets which include cash and due from banks interestbearing deposits in banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements loan commitments and letters of credit generally have shortterm variablerate features and contain clauses that limit huntingtons exposure to changes in customer credit quality accordingly their carrying values which are immaterial at the respective balance sheet dates are reasonable estimates of fair value not all the financial instruments listed in the table above are subject to the disclosure provisions of asc topic 820    172    table of contents certain assets the most significant being operating lease assets bank owned life insurance and premises and equipment do not meet the definition of a financial instrument and are excluded from this disclosure similarly mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights deposit base and other customer relationship intangibles are not considered financial instruments and are not included above accordingly this fair value information is not intended to and does not represent huntingtons underlying value many of the assets and liabilities subject to the disclosure requirements are not actively traded requiring fair values to be estimated by management these estimations necessarily involve the use of judgment about a wide variety of factors including but not limited to relevancy of market prices of comparable instruments expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates  the following methods and assumptions were used by huntington to estimate the fair value of the remaining classes of financial instruments  loans and direct financing leases  variablerate loans that reprice frequently are based on carrying amounts as adjusted for estimated credit losses the fair values for other loans and leases are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and employ interest rates currently being offered for loans and leases with similar terms the rates take into account the position of the yield curve as well as an adjustment for prepayment risk operating costs and profit this value is also reduced by an estimate of expected losses and the credit risk associated in the loan and lease portfolio the valuation of the loan portfolio reflected discounts that huntington believed are consistent with transactions occurring in the market place  deposits  demand deposits savings accounts and money market deposits are by definition equal to the amount payable on demand the fair values of fixedrate time deposits are estimated by discounting cash flows using interest rates currently being offered on certificates with similar maturities  debt  fixedrate longterm debt is based upon quoted market prices which are inclusive of huntingtons credit risk in the absence of quoted market prices discounted cash flows using market rates for similar debt with the same maturities are used in the determination of fair value  20 derivative financial instruments  derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities respectively and measured at fair value  derivatives used in asset and liability management activities  a variety of derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps cap floors and collars are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements these instruments provide flexibility in adjusting huntingtons sensitivity to changes in interest rates without exposure to loss of principal and higher funding requirements huntington records derivatives at fair value as further described in note 19 collateral agreements are regularly entered into as part of the underlying derivative agreements with huntingtons counterparties to mitigate counterparty credit risk at december 31 2012 and 2011 aggregate credit risk associated with these derivatives net of collateral that has been pledged by the counterparty was 174 million and 364 million respectively the credit risk associated with derivatives used in asset and liability management activities is calculated after considering master netting agreements  at december 31 2012 huntington pledged 1811 million of investment securities and cash collateral to counterparties while other counterparties pledged 1625 million of investment securities and cash collateral to huntington to satisfy collateral netting agreements in the event of credit downgrades huntington would not be required to provide additional collateral  the following table presents the gross notional values of derivatives used in huntingtons asset and liability management activities

managing the interest rate risk of assets and liabilities consequently net amounts receivable or payable on contracts hedging either interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities were accrued as an adjustment to either interest income or interest expense the net amounts resulted in an increase to net interest income of 1075 million 1139 million and 1922 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively  in connection with securitization activities huntington purchased interest rate caps with a notional value totaling 06 billion these purchased caps were assigned to the securitization trust for the benefit of the security holders interest rate caps were also sold totaling 06 billion outside the securitization structure both the purchased and sold caps are marked to market through income  in connection with the sale of huntingtons class b visa shares huntington entered into a swap agreement with the purchaser of the shares the swap agreement adjusts for dilution in the conversion ratio of class b shares resulting from the visa litigation at december 31 2012 the fair value of the swap liability of 04 million is an estimate of the exposure

notional amount which effectively converts a portion of its floatingrate debt to a fixedrate debt this reduces the potentially adverse impact of increases in interest rates on future interest expense other liborbased commercial and industrial loans were effectively converted to fixedrate by entering into contracts that swap certain variablerate interest payments for fixedrate interest payments at

variablerate and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly shortterm variablerate nature  standby lettersofcredit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a borrower to a third party these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements including commercial paper bond financing and similar transactions most of these arrangements mature within two years the carrying amount of deferred revenue associated with these guarantees was 14 million and 16 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively  through the

under this risk rating system as of december 31 2012 approximately 93 million of the standby lettersofcredit were rated strong with sufficient asset quality liquidity and good debt capacity and coverage approximately 393 million were rated average with acceptable asset quality liquidity and modest debt capacity and approximately 29 million were rated substandard with negative financial trends structural weaknesses operating difficulties and higher leverage  commercial lettersofcredit represent shortterm selfliquidating instruments that facilitate customer trade transactions and generally have maturities of no longer than 90 days the goods or cargo being traded normally secures these instruments  commitments to sell loans  huntington enters into forward contracts relating to

the normal conduct of business when the company determines it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted it vigorously defends itself the company will consider settlement of cases when in managements judgment it is in the best interests of both the company and its shareholders to do so    181    table of contents on at least a quarterly basis huntington assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available for matters where it is probable the company will incur a loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated huntington establishes an accrual for the loss once established the accrual is adjusted as appropriate to reflect any relevant developments for matters where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated no accrual is established  in certain cases exposure to loss exists in excess of the accrual to the extent such loss is reasonably possible but not probable management believes an estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued for current legal proceedings is from 0 to approximately 1300 million at december 31 2012 for certain other cases management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss at this time any estimate involves significant judgment given the varying stages of the proceedings including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages the existence of multiple defendants in several of the current proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined the numerous unresolved issues in many of the proceedings and the inherent uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings accordingly managements estimate will change from timetotime and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimate  while the final outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain based on information currently available advice of counsel and available insurance coverage management believes that the amount it has already accrued is adequate and any incremental liability arising from the companys legal proceedings will not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial position as a whole however in the event of unexpected future developments it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters if unfavorable may be material to the companys consolidated financial position in a particular period  the following is a discussion of certain legal matters and events occurring through the date of this filing  the bank is a defendant in three lawsuits which collectively may be material arising from its commercial lending depository and equipment leasing relationships with cyberco holdings inc cyberco based in grand rapids michigan in november 2004 the federal bureau of investigation and the irs raided the cyberco facilities and cybercos operations ceased an equipment leasing fraud was uncovered whereby cyberco sought financing from equipment lessors and financial institutions including the bank allegedly to purchase computer equipment from teleservices group inc teleservices cyberco created fraudulent documentation to close the financing transactions while in fact no computer equipment was ever purchased or leased from teleservices which proved to be a shell corporation  on june 22 2007 a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of michigan district court was filed by el camino resources ltd eplus group inc and bank midwest na all of whom had lending relationships with cyberco against the bank alleging that cyberco defrauded plaintiffs and converted plaintiffs property through various means in connection with the equipment leasing scheme and alleges that the bank aided and abetted cyberco in committing the alleged fraud and conversion the complaint further alleges that the banks actions entitle one of the plaintiffs to recover 19 million from the bank as a form of unjust enrichment in addition plaintiffs claimed direct damages of approximately 320 million and additional consequential damages in excess of 200 million on july 1 2010 the district court issued an opinion and order adopting in full a federal magistrates recommendation for summary judgment in favor of the bank on all claims except the unjust enrichment claim and a partial summary judgment was entered on july 1 2010 the bank requested an opportunity to file a motion for summary judgment on the remaining unjust enrichment claim against it a motion for reconsideration filed by the plaintiffs regarding the partial summary judgment was denied subsequently in connection with a premotion conference the district court in lieu of allowing the bank to file a summary judgment motion ordered the case to be tried in april 2012 in a one day bench trial and entered a scheduling order governing all pretrial conduct on february 6 2012 the district court dismissed the remaining count for unjust enrichment following a finding by the bankruptcy court that the plaintiff must pursue its rights if any with respect to that count in a bankruptcy court the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on march 2 2012 appealing the district courts judgment against them on the aiding and abetting and conversion claims oral arguments before the sixth circuit court of appeals were held january 24 2013  the bank is also involved with the chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings of both cyberco filed on december 9 2004 and teleservices filed on january 21 2005 the cyberco bankruptcy trustee commenced an adversary proceeding against the bank on december 8 2006 seeking over 700 million he alleges was transferred to the bank the bank responded with a motion to dismiss and all but the preference claims were dismissed on january 29 2008 the cyberco bankruptcy trustee alleges preferential transfers in the amount of approximately 12 million the bankruptcy court ordered the case to be tried in july 2012 and entered a pretrial order governing all pretrial conduct the bank has filed a motion for summary judgment based on the cyberco trustee seeking recovery in connection with the same alleged transfers as the teleservices trustee in the case described below the bankruptcy court granted the motion in principal part and the parties stipulated to a full dismissal which was entered on june 19 2012    182    table of contents the teleservices bankruptcy trustee filed an adversary proceeding against the bank on january 19 2007 seeking to avoid and recover alleged transfers that occurred in two ways 1 checks made payable to the bank to be applied to cybercos indebtedness to the bank and 2 deposits into cybercos bank accounts with the bank a trial was held as to only the banks defenses subsequently the trustee filed a summary judgment motion on her affirmative case alleging the fraudulent transfers to the bank totaled approximately 730 million and seeking judgment in that amount which includes the 12 million alleged to be preferential transfers by the cyberco bankruptcy trustee on march 17 2011 the bankruptcy court issued an opinion determining the alleged transfers made to the bank were not received in good faith from the time period of april 30 2004 through november 2004 and that the bank had failed to show a lack of knowledge of the avoidability of the alleged transfers from september 2003 through april 30 2004 the trustee then filed an amended motion for summary judgment on her affirmative case and a hearing was held on july 1 2011  on march 30 2012 the bankruptcy court issued an opinion on the trustees motion determining the bank was the initial transferee of the checks made payable to it and was a subsequent transferee of all deposits into cybercos accounts the bankruptcy court ruled cybercos deposits were themselves transfers to the bank under the bankruptcy code and the bank was liable for both the checks and the deposits totaling approximately 730 million the bankruptcy court ruled the bank may be entitled to a credit of approximately 40 million for the cyberco trustees recoveries in preference actions filed against third parties that received payments from cyberco within 90 days preceding cybercos bankruptcy lastly the bankruptcy court ruled that it will award prejudgment interest to the teleservices trustee at a rate to be determined a trial was held on these remaining issues on april 30 2012 and the court gave a bench opinion on july 23 2012 in that opinion the court denied the bank the 40 million credit but ruled approximately 09 million in deposits were either doublecounted or were outside the timeframe in which the teleservices trustee can recover therefore the bankruptcy courts recommended award will be reduced by this 09 million further the bankruptcy court ruled the interest rate specified in the federal statute governing postjudgment interest which is based on treasury bill rates will be the rate of interest for determining prejudgment interest the rulings of the bankruptcy court in its march 2011 and march 2012 opinions as well as its july 23 2012 bench opinion will not be reduced to judgment by the bankruptcy court rather the bankruptcy court has delivered a report and recommendation to the district court for the western district of michigan recommending a judgment be entered in the principal amount of 718 million plus interest through july 27 2012 in the amount of 88 million the district court will conduct a de novo review of the fact findings and legal conclusions in the bankruptcy courts opinions  in the pending bankruptcy cases of cyberco and teleservices the bank moved to substantively consolidate the two bankruptcy estates principally on the ground that teleservices was the alter ego and a mere instrumentality of cyberco at all times on july 2 2010 the bankruptcy court issued an opinion denying the banks motions for substantive consolidation of the two bankruptcy estates the bank has appealed this ruling and the appeal is pending  on january 17 2012 the company was named a defendant in a putative class action filed on behalf of all 88 counties in ohio against merscorp inc and numerous other financial institutions that participate in the mortgage electronic registration system mers the complaint alleges that recording of
