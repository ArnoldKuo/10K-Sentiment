  risk governance  we use a multifaceted approach to risk governance it begins with the board of directors defining our risk appetite in aggregate as moderatetolow this does not preclude engagement in select higher risk activities rather the definition is intended to represent an average of where we want our overall risk to be managed    13    table of contents two board committees oversee implementation of this desired risk profile the audit committee and the risk oversight committee            the audit committee is principally involved with overseeing the integrity of financial statements providing oversight of the internal audit department and selecting our external auditors our chief auditor reports directly to the audit committee chair            the risk oversight committee supervises our risk management processes which primarily cover credit market liquidity operational compliance legal strategic and reputational risks it also approves the charters of executive risk management committees sets risk limits on certain risk measures eg economic value of equity receives results of the risk selfassessment process and routinely engages management in review of key risks our credit review executive reports directly to the risk oversight committee  both committees are comprised of independent directors and routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and risk management  on a periodic basis the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both such as the construct and appropriateness of the acl which is reviewed quarterly  we maintain a philosophy that each colleague is responsible for risk this is manifested by the design of a risk management organization that places emphasis on riskownership by risktakers we believe that by placing ownership of risk within its related business segment attention to and accountability for risk is heightened  further through its compensation committee the board of directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards is risksensitive and aligns the interests of management creditors and shareholders we utilize a variety of compensationrelated tools to induce appropriate behavior including common stock ownership thresholds for the chief executive officer and certain members of senior management a requirement to hold until retirement a portion of net shares received upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards 50 for executive officers and 25 for other award recipients equity deferrals clawback provisions and the right to terminate compensation plans at any time  management has introduced a number of steps to help ensure an aggregate moderatetolow risk appetite is maintained foremost is a quarterly selfassessment process in which each business segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls the segment analyses are combined with assessments by our risk management organization of major risk sectors eg credit market operational reputational compliance etc to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment outcomes of the process include a determination of the quality of the overall control process the direction of risk and our position compared to the defined risk appetite  management also utilizes a wide series of metrics key risk indicators to monitor risk positions throughout the company in general a range for each metric is established which allows the company in aggregate to maintain its moderatetolow risk profile deviations from the range will indicate if the risk being measured is moving which may then necessitate corrective action  we also have four other executive level committees to manage risk alco credit policy and strategy risk management and capital management each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature we believe this structure helps ensure appropriate elevation of issues and overall communication of strategies  huntington utilizes three levels of defense with regard to risk management 1 business segments 2 corporate risk management and 3 internal audit and credit review to induce greater ownership of risk within its business segments segment risk officers have been embedded to identify and monitor risk elevate and remediate issues establish controls perform selftesting and oversee the quarterly selfassessment process segment risk officers report directly to the related segment manager with a dotted line to the chief risk officer corporate risk management establishes policies sets operating limits reviews new or modified productsprocesses ensures consistency and quality assurance within the segments and produces the enterprise risk assessment the chief risk officer has significant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans as they apply to risk internal audit and credit review provide additional assurance that riskrelated functions are operating as intended  huntington believes it has provided a sound risk governance foundation to support the bank our process will be subject to continuous improvement and enhancement our objective is to have strong risk management practices and capabilities    14    table of contents risk overview  we like other financial companies are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations many of which are outside of our direct control though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns among the risks assumed are 1 credit risk which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms 2 market risk which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads 3 liquidity risk which is a the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external macro market issues investor and customer perception of financial strength and events unrelated to us such as war terrorism or financial institution market specific issues and b the risk of loss based on our ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments due to the mix and maturity structure of our balance sheet amount of onhand cash and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding 4 operational and legal risk which is the risk of loss due to human error inadequate or failed internal systems and controls violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters and security risks and 5 compliance risk which exposes us to money penalties enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws rules and regulations that apply to the financial services industry  we also expend considerable effort to contain risk which emanates from execution of our business strategies and work relentlessly to protect the companys reputation strategic risk and reputational risk do not easily lend themselves to traditional methods of measurement rather we closely monitor them through processes such as new product  initiative reviews frequent financial performance reviews employee and client surveys monitoring market intelligence periodic discussions between management and our board and other such efforts  in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report readers should carefully consider that the following important factors among others could negatively impact our business future results of operations and future cash flows materially  credit risks  1 our acl level may prove to be inappropriate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could materially adversely affect our net income and capital  our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers our acl of 8097 million at december 31 2012 represented managements estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we periodically review our acl for appropriateness in doing so we consider economic conditions and trends collateral values and credit quality indicators such as past chargeoff experience levels of past due loans and npas there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases if the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  in addition bank regulators periodically review our acl and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan chargeoffs any increase in our acl or loan chargeoffs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  2 weakness in economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business  our performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us our customers and our counterparties these conditions could result in one or more of the following            a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us            a decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us and            an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us  an increase in the number of delinquencies bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of npas ncos provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale the markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and thus are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors    15    table of contents 3 uncertain economic conditions in our markets could result in higher delinquencies greater chargeoffs and increased losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate in future periods  like all financial institutions we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn while beginning to improve slightly there has been a slowdown in the housing market across our geographic footprint over the past several years reflecting declining prices and excess inventories of houses to be sold these developments have had and further declines may continue to have a negative effect on our financial conditions and results of operations at december 31 2012 we had            83 billion of home equity loans and lines representing 20 of total loans and leases            50 billion in residential real estate loans representing 12 of total loans and leases            43 billion of federal agency mortgagebacked securities 01 billion of private label cmos and less than 01 billion of alta mortgagebacked securities that could be negatively affected by a decline in home values            04 billion of bank owned life insurance investments primarily in mortgagebacked securities  because of the decline in home values some of our borrowers have mortgages that exceed the value of their homes the decline in home values coupled with the weakened economy has increased short sales and foreclosures the reduced levels of home sales have had a materially adverse effect on the prices achieved on the sale of foreclosed properties further decline in home values may escalate these problems resulting in higher delinquencies greater chargeoffs and increased losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate in future periods  market risks  1 changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income reduce transactional income and negatively impact the value of our loans securities and other assets this could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows financial condition results of operations and capital  our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions conditions such as inflation deflation recession unemployment money supply and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates  at december 31 2012 41 billion or 18 of our commercial loan portfolio and 25 billion or 50 of our residential mortgage portfolio as measured by the aggregate outstanding principal balances were fixedrate loans and the remainder was adjustablerate loans if our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment net interest income could be materially adversely impacted likewise if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment net interest income could be adversely impacted  changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans securities assets under management and other assets including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights an increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in npas and a reduction of income recognized which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows when we place a loan on nonaccrual status we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable which decreases interest income however we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding nals without any corresponding interest income in addition transactional income including trust income brokerage income and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from periodtoperiod based on a number of factors including the interest rate environment  rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixedrate debt securities and cash flow hedging derivatives portfolio any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts oci shareholders equity and the tangible common equity ratio any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios notably tier i and total riskbased capital ratios in a rising interest rate environment pension and other postretirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative oci impacts from securities and financial instruments  certain investment securities notably mortgagebacked securities are very sensitive to rising and falling rates generally when rates rise the duration of mortgagebacked securities increases as prepayments of principal and interest decrease conversely when rates fall the duration of mortgagebacked securities decreases as prepayments increase in either case interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgagebacked securities investments  liquidity risks  1 if we lose access to capital markets we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors creditors and borrowers or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities    16    table of contents liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost the bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers the board of directors establishes liquidity policies and limits and management establishes operating guidelines for liquidity  wholesale funding sources include securitization federal funds purchased securities sold under repurchase agreements noncore deposits and medium and longterm debt which includes a domestic bank note program the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank of cincinnati which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgagerelated assets we maintain a portfolio of highlyrated marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity the bank also can borrow from the federal reserves discount window  capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of the bank and corporation the inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations cash flows and level of regulatoryqualifying capital we may from timetotime consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions  2 due to the losses that the bank incurred in 2008 and 2009 at december 31 2012 the bank and its subsidiaries could not declare and pay dividends to the holding company any subsidiary of the holding company outside the banks consolidated group or any security holder outside the banks consolidated group without regulatory approval also the bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits  dividends from the bank to the parent company are the primary source of funds for the payment of dividends to our shareholders under applicable statutes and regulations a national bank may not declare and pay dividends in any year greater than its undivided profits or in excess of an amount equal to the sum of the total of the net income of the bank for that year and the retained net income of the bank for the preceding two years minus the sum of any transfers required by the occ and any transfers required to be made to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock unless the occ approves the declaration and payment of dividends in excess of such amount the banks undivided profits were in a deficit position throughout 2012 since the first quarter of 2008 the bank has requested and received occ approval each quarter to pay periodic dividends to shareholders outside the banks consolidated group on the preferred and common stock of its reit and capital financing subsidiaries to the extent necessary to maintain their reit status a whollyowned nonbank subsidiary of the parent company owns a portion of the preferred shares of the reit and capital financing subsidiaries outside of the reit and capital financing subsidiary dividends we do not anticipate that the bank will declare dividends during 2013 due to the deficit position of its undivided profits  operational and legal risks  1 the resolution of significant pending litigation if unfavorable could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period  we face legal risks in our businesses and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters if unfavorable may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period  note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements updates the status of litigation concerning cyberco holdings inc although the bank maintains litigation reserves related to this case the ultimate resolution of the matter if unfavorable may be material to our results of operations for a particular reporting period  2 we face significant operational risks which could lead to expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and capital markets  we are exposed to many types of operational risks including cyberattack risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders unauthorized transactions by employees or outsiders or operational errors by employees including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems these operational risks could lead to expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and the capital markets  moreover negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including lending practices corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action    17    table of contents relative to acquisitions we cannot predict if or when we will be able to identify and attract acquisition candidates or make acquisitions on favorable terms we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of acquired institutions in a timely and efficient manner and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies  huntington is under continuous threat of loss due to cyberattacks especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business the most significant cyberattack risks that we face are efraud denial of service and loss of sensitive customer data loss from efraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from customer or our accounts loss can occur as a result of negative customer experience in the event of a successful denial of service attack that disrupts availability of our online banking services the attempts to breach sensitive customer data such as account numbers and social security numbers could present significant reputational legal andor regulatory costs to us if successful our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers our plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers  3 failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and stock price  effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud as a financial holding company we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures such controls and procedures are modified supplemented and changed from timetotime as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments any failure to maintain in the future an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis which could result in regulatory actions loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our business and stock price  compliance risks  1 bank regulators and other regulations including proposed basel iii capital standards and capital plan reviews may require higher capital levels impacting our ability to pay common stock dividends or repurchase our common stock  in june 2012 the frb occ and fdic collectively the agencies issued three notices of proposed rulemaking nprs that would revise and replace the agencies current capital rules to align with the basel iii capital standards and meet certain requirements of the doddfrank act certain requirements of the proposed nprs would establish more restrictive capital definitions higher riskweightings for certain asset classes capital buffers and higher minimum capital ratios the proposed nprs were in a comment period through october 22 2012 and are subject to further modification by the agencies as the release of the final rules has been deferred indefinitely see the capital section within managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the federal reserve has issued guidelines for evaluating proposals by certain bank holding companies including huntington to undertake capital actions such as increasing dividend payments or repurchasing or redeeming stock this process is known as the federal reserves capital plan review pursuant to those federal reserve guidelines huntington submitted its initial proposed capital plan to the federal reserve in january 2012 on march 14 2012 we were notified by the federal reserve that it had not objected to our proposed capital actions included in our capital plan these actions included the potential repurchase of up to 182 million of common stock and a continuation of our current common dividend through the first quarter of 2013 on january 7 2013 huntington submitted its 2013 capital plan to the federal reserve including proposed capital actions through the first quarter of 2014  the federal reserve and occ are expected to undertake these capital plan reviews on a regular basis in the future there can be no assurance that the federal reserve or occ will respond favorably to our capital plan as part of their future capital plan reviews and the federal reserve occ or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including common stock dividends and stock repurchases although not currently anticipated our regulators may require us to raise additional capital in the future issuing additional common stock may dilute existing stockholders  the federal reserve has issued a proposed rule that in addition to the broader basel iii capital reforms will implement the application of the federal reserves capital plans rule including the requirement to maintain capital above 5 for the tier 1 common riskbased capital ratio under both expected and stressed conditions  2 if our regulators deem it appropriate they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our ability to compete for new business constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends and increase the cost of our services    18    table of contents we are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators including the occ federal reserve fdic sec cfpb financial industry regulatory authority and various state regulatory agencies as such we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations many of which are discussed in the regulatory matters section as part of their supervisory process which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways including monetary fines impacting our ability to pay dividends precluding mergers or acquisitions limiting our ability to offer certain products or services or imposing additional capital requirements  3 legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impacts the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs adding complexity in doing business impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets requiring us to increase our regulatory capital limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities and otherwise result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operation liquidity or stock price  the us government has intervened on an unprecedented scale responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis in addition to the previously enacted governmental assistance programs designed to stabilize and stimulate the us economy recent market conditions have led to numerous programs and proposals to reform the financial regulatory system and prevent future crises including the doddfrank act  the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states establishes the new federal cfpb and requires the bureau and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations at this time it is difficult to predict the extent to which the doddfrank act or the resulting rules and regulations in their entirety will impact our business compliance with these new laws and regulations will result in additional costs which could be significant and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations  with the development of the cfpb our consumer products and services are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations we may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations enforcement actions and litigation in the future related to consumer practices thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions in addition increased regulatory inquiries and investigations as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments could result in significant loss of revenue limit the products or services we offer require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products impose additional compliance costs on us cause harm to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses in addition if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to our consumer operations we may be subject to fines penalties or judgments or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses which could adversely affect operations and in turn financial results
