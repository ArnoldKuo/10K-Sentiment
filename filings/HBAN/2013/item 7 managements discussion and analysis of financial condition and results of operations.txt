executive overview  2012 financial performance review  in 2012 we reported net income of 6410 million or 071 per common share an increase of 984 million compared with 2011 see table 2 the increase primarily reflected a 1172 million or 12 increase in noninterest income and an 814 million or 5 increase in net interest income this was partially offset by a 1074 million or 6 increase in noninterest expense despite the challenging economic and extended low interest rate environment combined with impacts of governmentmandated reductions in fee income during 2012 return on average total assets increased to 115 compared with 101 in 2011 results from our strategic business investments and ocr sales approach continued in 2012 also see significant items influencing financial performance comparisons within the discussion of results of operations  fullytaxable equivalent net interest income was 17 billion in 2012 an increase of 868 million or 5 compared with 2011 average earning assets increased 21 billion or 4 including a 13 billion or 3 increase in total loans and leases and a 08 billion increase in loans held for sale this reflected benefits from our strategic campi initiatives focusing on the equipment finance dealer floorplan large corporate and middle market segments this increase was partially offset by a decline in our automobile loans reflecting the impact of our continued program of securitization and sale of such loans additionally our cre portfolio declined reflecting continued runoff of the noncore portfolio average core deposits grew 31 billion or 8 reflecting our consumer household and commercial relationship growth this growth continued even as we focused on fundamentally changing our deposit mix and reducing the overall cost of funds the net interest margin increased 3 basis points to 341 from 338 the increase reflected the positive impact of a 29 basis point decline in total deposit costs that was partially offset by a 24 basis point decline in the yield on earning assets and a 2 basis point decrease related to nondeposit funding and other items    24    table of contents noninterest income was 11 billion in 2012 a 12 increase compared with 2011 this included a 1077 million or 129 increase in mortgage banking income a 262 million or 82 increase in gain on sale of loans an 187 million or 8 increase in service charges on deposit accounts an 116 million or 32 increase in capital market fees and an 112 million bargain purchase gain related to the acquisition of fidelity bank these positive impacts were partially offset by a 294 million or 26 decrease in electronic banking income which was negatively impacted by over 55 million from the durbin amendment and a 160 million or 11 decrease in other income reflecting a 165 million or 62 decrease in automobile operating lease income this years results showed the continued benefit of our investments and our differentiated strategy these investments combined with adding over 133000 consumer households a 12 increase and 12700 commercial relationships a 9 increase has allowed us to grow revenue and pretax income by more than 200 million and 117 million respectively  noninterest expense was 18 billion in 2012 a 6 increase compared with 2011 this included a 957 million or 11 increase in personnel costs primarily reflecting an increase in the number of fulltime equivalent employees as well as higher incentive based compensation and a 104 million or 11 increase in equipment expense primarily reflecting the implementation of strategic initiatives including opening 37 or 6 net new branches these increases were offset partially by a 93 million or 12 decrease in deposit and other insurance expense the current year results also included 141 million of noninterest expense related to the fidelity acquisition which closed on march 30 2012  credit quality performance continued to show improvement as both our nals and ncos declined and coverage ratios increased compared with the prior year nals declined 25 ncos were 3425 million or 085 of average total loans and leases down from 4371 million or 112 in 2011 of the current years ncos 346 million related to regulatory guidance requiring consumer loans discharged under chapter 7 bankruptcy to be charged down to collateral value the acl as a percentage of loans and leases was 199 down from 260 at december 31 2011 and our acl as a percentage of total nals increased to 199 from 187 the level of criticized commercial loans also declined 05 billion or 25 from last year the provision for credit losses declined 267 million or 15 from 2011  at december 31 2012 our regulatory tier 1 common riskbased capital ratio was 1048 up from 1000 at december 31 2011 and our tangible common equity ratio increased to 876 from 830 over this same period the regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital ratio at december 31 2012 was 1202 down from 1211 at december 31 2011 this decline reflected the redemption of 230 million of trust preferred securities and the repurchase of 233 million common shares at an average price of 636 per share reinvesting excess capital to grow the business organically remains our first priority importantly through dividends and share repurchases we have the flexibility subject to market conditions and regulatory approval to return a meaningful amount of our earnings to our shareholders we continue to evaluate other capital actions as we have shown over the last several years we will continue to maintain a high level of discipline when considering mergers and acquisitions  business overview  general  our general business objectives are 1 grow net interest income and fee income 2 increase crosssell and shareofwallet across all business segments 3 improve efficiency ratio 4 continue to strengthen risk management including sustained improvements in credit metrics and 5 maintain strong capital and liquidity positions  we were pleased with the financial results in 2012 which reflected steady growth in a number of key areas including loans deposits and customer relationships as well as improved profitability this growth has occurred in a challenging economic and regulatory environment it demonstrates the continued benefits from successfully executing our longterm strategic plan including the investments we have made during the previous three years those investments added over 50 million of pretax income during 2012 and we expect that benefit to grow as those investments continue to mature while some businesses are hesitant to invest given the current uncertainty in the economy we believe our differentiated approach to banking combined with investing in our franchise through enhanced products and services will drive growth and improvement of our longterm profitability  as is the nature of a mature industry with arguably overcapacity we continue to face strong competition from other banks and financial service firms in our markets to address these challenges the cornerstone of our strategy has been to invest in the franchise in order to grow our market share and shareofwallet in this regard our ocr methodology continued to deliver strong success in 2012 consumer checking account households grew 122 and our crosssell performance continued to improve at the end of the year 783 of our consumer checking account households utilized over four products this compared with 735 a year earlier growth in commercial relationships was 92 in 2012 at the end of the year 350 of our commercial relationships used over four products or services up from 314 a year earlier our fair play philosophy combined with continued ocr success while positively impacting 2012 results also positions us for better longterm performance    25    table of contents economy  we continue to see positive trends within our midwest markets relative to the broader united states nevertheless broad based customer sentiment began to change in late 2012 due to increased concerns regarding the us economy while some businesses are hesitant to invest given the current uncertainty in the economy we believe our differentiated approach to banking combined with investing in our franchise through enhanced products and services will drive growth and improvement of our longterm profitability  generally our footprint large metropolitan statistical areas msa unemployment rates were below the national average as of november 2012 in addition fhfa housing prices were up in the 2012 third quarter relative to the same quarter of last year in all of our footprint states except pennsylvania which was essentially unchanged strong affordability and continued economic growth should support continued housing recovery in 2013 as long as risks to the overall us economy are contained  legislative and regulatory  regulatory reforms continue to be adopted which impose additional restrictions on current business practices recent actions affecting us include the banking regulators basel iii proposal and deferral frb and occ capital plans and stress testing rules and cfpb rules governing consumer mortgage lending a comprehensive discussion of legislative and regulatory matters can be found in the regulatory matters section included in item 1 of this form 10k  2013 expectations  we expect to continue seeing the strong growth of the midwest economy relative to the broader united states however business sentiment continues to be negatively influenced by the uncertainty in washington and its direct impact on the us economy we remain optimistic that when solutions are in place the strength of the midwest and the soundness of our strategy will continue to drive growth  net interest income is expected to modestly grow over the course of 2013 after experiencing its usual first quarter seasonal decline as we anticipate an increase in total loans excluding the impact of any future loan securitizations however those benefits to net interest income are expected to be mostly offset by downward pressure on our net interest margin the net interest margin is not expected to fall below the mid 330s due to continued deposit repricing and mix shift opportunities while maintaining a disciplined approach to loan pricing  the campi portfolio is expected to continue to see growth in 2013 although we expect growth will be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year when we expect economic uncertainty driven by washington to be resolved our campi sales pipeline remains robust with much of this reflecting the positive impact from our strategic initiatives focused ocr sales process and continued support of middle market and small business lending in the midwest while onbalance sheet exposure is expected to increase we will continue to evaluate the use of automobile loan securitizations due to our expectation of continued strong levels of originations and anticipate two securitizations in 2013 residential mortgages and home equity loan balances are expected to increase modestly cre loans likely will experience declines from current levels but are expected to remain in the 50 to 55 billion range  excluding potential future automobile loan securitizations we anticipate the increase in total loans will modestly outpace growth in total deposits this reflects our continued focus on the overall cost of funds the continued shift towards low and nocost demand deposits and money market deposit accounts and a reduction in balances with several larger relationships  noninterest income over the course of 2013 excluding the impact of any automobile loan sales any net msr impact and typical first quarter seasonality is expected to be relatively stable at current levels the anticipated slowdown in mortgage banking activity is expected to be offset by continued growth in new customers increased contribution from higher crosssell and the continued maturation of our previous strategic investments  noninterest expense continued to run at levels above our longterm expectations relative to revenue in response to changes in our economic outlook we have moderated the pace and size of our planned investments in order to drive positive operating leverage in 2013  credit quality is expected to experience improvement and ncos should approach normalized levels by the end of 2013 the level of provision for credit losses in 2012 was at the low end of our longterm expectation and we expect some quarterly volatility within each of the loan categories given the absolute low level of the provision for credit losses and the uncertain and uneven nature of the economic recovery    26    table of contents we anticipate an effective tax rate for 2013 to approximate 35 of income before income taxes less approximately 75 to 90 million of permanent differences primarily related to taxexempt income tax advantaged investments and general

contents discussion of results of operations  this section provides a review of financial performance from a consolidated perspective it also includes a significant items section that summarizes key issues important for a complete understanding of performance trends key consolidated balance sheet and income statement trends are discussed all earnings per share data is reported on a diluted basis for additional insight on financial performance please read this section in conjunction with the business segment discussion  significant items  definition of significant items  from timetotime revenue expenses or taxes are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities and  or by items that while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or shortterm in nature we refer to such items as significant items most often these significant items result from factors originating outside the company eg regulatory actions  assessments windfall gains changes in accounting principles onetime tax assessments  refunds litigation actions etc in other cases they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of business eg merger  restructuring charges recapitalization actions goodwill impairment etc  even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions as a general rule volatility alone does not define a significant item for example changes in the provision for credit losses gains  losses from investment activities asset valuation writedowns etc reflect ordinary banking activities and are therefore typically excluded from consideration as a significant item  management believes the disclosure of significant items in current and prior period results aids analystsinvestors in better understanding corporate performance and trends so that they can ascertain which of such items if any they may wish to includeexclude from their analysis of the companys performanceie within the context of determining how that performance differed from their expectations as well as how if at all to adjust their estimates of future performance accordingly to this end management has adopted a practice of listing significant items in its external disclosure documents eg earnings press releases quarterly performance discussions investor presentations forms 10q and 10k  significant items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance  significant items influencing financial performance comparisons  earnings comparisons among the three years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were impacted by a number of significant items summarized below        1 state deferred tax asset valuation allowance adjustment during 2012 a valuation allowance of 213 million net of tax was released for the portion of the deferred tax asset and state net operating loss carryforwards expected to be realized this resulted in a positive impact of 002 per common share for 2012 additional information can be found in the provision for income taxes section within this mdampa        2 bargain purchase gain during 2012 an 112 million bargain purchase gain associated with the fdicassisted fidelity bank acquisition was recorded in noninterest income this resulted in a positive impact of 001 per common share for 2012        3 litigation reserve 235 million and 170 million of additions to litigation reserves were recorded as other noninterest expense in 2012 and 2011 respectively this resulted in a negative impact of 002 per common share in 2012 and 001 per common share in 2011        4  visa prior to the visa ipo occurring in march 2008 visa was owned by its member banks which included the bank as a result of this ownership we received class b shares of visa stock at the time of the visa ipo in 2009 we sold these visa stock shares resulting in a 314 million pretax gain 04 per common share this amount was recorded to noninterest income in 2011 a 64 million derivative loss due to an increase in the liability associated with the sale of these shares was recorded to noninterest income    30

those events on our reported results were as follows            during 2010 a 382 million 005 per common share net tax benefit was recognized primarily reflecting the increase in the net deferred tax asset relating to the assets acquired from the march 31 2009 restructuring            during 2010 the portfolio of franklinrelated loans 3330 million of residential mortgages and 647 million of home equity loans was transferred to loans held for sale at the time of the transfer the loans were marked to the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell of 3234 million resulting in 755 million of chargeoffs and the provision for credit losses commensurately increased 755 million 007 per common share        6 early extinguishment of debt the positive impact relating to the early extinguishment of debt on our reported results was 97 million 001 per common share in 2011  the following table reflects the earnings impact of the abovementioned significant items for periods affected by this

between interest income from earning assets primarily loans securities and direct financing leases and interest expense of funding sources primarily interestbearing deposits and borrowings earning asset balances and related funding sources as well as changes in the levels of interest rates impact net interest income the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interestbearing liabilities is the net interest spread noninterestbearing sources of funds such as demand deposits and shareholders equity also support earning assets the impact of the noninterestbearing sources of funds often referred to as free funds is captured in the net interest margin which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a fullytaxable equivalent basis which means that taxfree interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income assuming a 35 tax rate

provision for income taxes was 1841 million for 2012 compared with a provision for income taxes of 1646 million in 2011 both years included the benefits from taxexempt income taxadvantaged investments and general business credits in prior periods we established a full valuation allowance against state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards based on the uncertainty of forecasted state taxable income expected in applicable jurisdictions in order to utilize the state deferred tax asset and net operating loss carryforwards based on current analysis of both positive and negative evidence and projected forecasted state taxable income we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of the state deferred tax asset and state net operating loss carryforwards will be realized as a result of this analysis a net 213 million reduction in the 2012 provision for income taxes was recorded at december 31 2012 a valuation allowance of 618 million remained for certain state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards totaling 945 million that are not expected to be realized within the carryforward periods  at december 31 2012 we had a net deferred tax asset of 2039 million based on both positive and negative evidence and our level of forecasted future taxable income we determined that no impairment existed to the net deferred tax asset at december 31 2012 for regulatory capital purposes there was no disallowed net deferred tax asset at december 31 2012 compared to a total disallowed net deferred tax asset of 391 million at december 31 2011  we file income tax returns with the irs and various state city and foreign jurisdictions federal income tax audits have been completed for tax years through 2009 we have appealed certain proposed adjustments resulting from the irs examination of our 2006 and 2007 tax returns in addition we will appeal certain proposed adjustments resulting from the irs examination of our 2008 and 2009 tax returns we believe our positions related to such proposed adjustments are correct and supported by applicable statutes regulations and judicial authority and intend to vigorously defend them during 2011 we entered into discussions with the appeals division of the irs for the 2006 and 2007 tax returns it is possible the ultimate resolution of the proposed adjustments if unfavorable may be material to the results of operations in the period it occurs nevertheless although no assurances can be given we believe that the resolution of these examinations will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position various state and other jurisdictions remain open to examination including kentucky indiana michigan pennsylvania west virginia and illinois  2011 versus 2010  the provision for income taxes was 1646 million for 2011 compared with a provision of 400 million in 2010 both years included the benefits from taxexempt

previously reported earnings of a foreign subsidiary of 1423 million were distributed and an additional 498 million of tax expense was recorded during 2010 a 436 million net tax benefit was recognized primarily reflecting the increase in the net deferred tax asset relating to the assets acquired from the march 31 2009 franklin restructuring  risk management and capital  risk awareness identification and assessment reporting and active management are key elements in overall risk management we manage risk to an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to identified potential risks controls include among others effective segregation of duties access authorization and reconciliation procedures as well as staff education and a disciplined assessment process  we identify primary risks and the sources of those risks within each business unit we utilize risk and control selfassessments rcsa to identify exposure risks through this rcsa process we continually assess the effectiveness of controls associated with the identified risks regularly monitor risk profiles and material exposure to losses and identify stress events and scenarios to which we may be exposed our chief risk officer is responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems of controls are in place for managing and monitoring risk across the company potential risk concerns are shared with the risk management committee risk oversight committee and the board of directors as appropriate our internal audit department performs ongoing independent reviews of the risk management process and ensures the adequacy of documentation the results of these reviews are reported regularly to the audit committee and board of directors    39    table of contents we believe our primary risk exposures are credit market liquidity operational and compliance oriented credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a counterpartys ability to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates exchange rates and equity prices liquidity risk arises from the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments resulting from external macro market issues investor and customer perception of financial strength and events unrelated to us such as war terrorism or financial institution market specific issues in addition the mix and maturity structure of huntingtons balance sheet amount of onhand cash and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding can have an impact on huntingtons ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments we manage liquidity risk at both the bank and the parent company operational risk arises from our inherent daytoday operations that could result in losses due to human error inadequate or failed internal systems and controls and external events compliance risk exposes us to money penalties enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws rules and regulations that apply to the financial services industry  some of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit market liquidity operational and compliance risks are described in the following paragraphs  credit risk  credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending we also have credit risk associated with our afs securities portfolio see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management mortgage banking and for trading activities while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity we believe this exposure is minimal  we continue to focus on the identification monitoring and managing of our credit risk in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes market risk management activities and portfolio diversification we use additional quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources enhanced use of modeling technology and internal stress testing processes our portfolio management resources demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile in our efforts to continue to identify risk mitigation techniques we have focused on product design features origination policies and treatment strategies for delinquent or stressed borrowers  the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers all authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type geography industry and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives although we offer a broad set of products we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk portfolio profile  the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution for example we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage position to that end we continue to expand resources in our risk management areas  although credit quality improved in 2012 the weak residential real estate market and us economy continued to negatively impact us and the financial services industry as a whole we continued to experience higher than historical levels of delinquencies and ncos in our loan portfolios the performance metrics associated with the cre residential mortgage and home equity portfolios continued to be the most significantly impacted portfolios as real

the personal guarantee of the business owners the financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a campi loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral this treatment is a result of the credit decision process which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt the operation sale rental or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary

the borrower assessment of the borrowers management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process we utilize a centralized preview and senior loan approval committee led by our chief credit officer the risk rating see next paragraph and complexity of the credit determines the threshold for approval of the senior loan committee with a minimum credit exposure of 100 million for loans not requiring senior loan committee approval with the exception of small business loans credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority for small business loans we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures in this centralized decision environment certain individuals who understand each local region may make creditextension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities we operate in in addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval process  in commercial lending ongoing credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan we monitor all significant exposures on an ongoing basis all commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrowers pd and lgd this twodimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process the pd is rated and applied at the borrower level the lgd is rated and applied based on the specific type of credit extension and the quality and lien position associated with the underlying collateral the internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each periodic monitoring event there is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an ongoing basis we continually review and adjust our riskrating criteria based on actual experience which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate acl amount for the commercial portfolio a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio including small business loans to provide consistent oversight  in addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and  or risk of new loan originations this group is part of our risk management area and conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of credit processes  our standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment one of which is guarantor support on an annual basis or more frequently if warranted we consider among other things the guarantors reputation and creditworthiness along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth assuming such information is available our assessment of the guarantors credit strength or lack thereof is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans which is directly tied to and an integral component of our alll methodology when a loan goes to impaired status viable guarantor support is considered in the determination of the recognition of a loan loss  if our assessment of the guarantors credit strength yields an inherent capacity to perform we will seek repayment from the guarantor as part of the collection process and have done so successfully however we do not formally track the repayment success from guarantors  substantially all loans categorized as classified see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements are managed by our sad the sad is a specialized group of credit professionals that handle the daytoday management of workouts commercial recoveries and problem loan sales its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans assessing risk ratings and determining the appropriateness of the allowance the accrual status and the ultimate collectability of the classified loan portfolio  campi portfolio  the campi portfolio is comprised of loans to businesses where the source of repayment is associated with the ongoing operations of the business generally the loans are secured with the financing of the borrowers assets such as equipment accounts receivable andor inventory in many cases the loans are secured by real estate although the operation sale or refinancing of the real estate is not a primary source of repayment for the loan for loans secured by real estate appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements  there were no commercial loan segments considered an industry or geographic concentration of lending currently higherrisk segments of the campi portfolio include loans to borrowers supporting the home building industry contractors and leveraged lending we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio through origination policies a defined loan concentration policy with established limits ongoing loan level reviews and portfolio level reviews recourse requirements and continuous portfolio risk management activities our origination policies for this portfolio include loan producttype specific policies such as ltv and debt service coverage ratios as applicable  while some campi borrowers have been challenged by the continued weakness in the economy problem loans have trended downward reflecting a combination of proactive risk identification and effective workout strategies implemented by our sad nevertheless some borrowers may no longer have sufficient capital to withstand the extended stress and comply with the original terms of their credit agreements we continue to focus attention on the portfolio management process to proactively identify borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty to assess all potential solutions    43    table of contents cre portfolio  we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio specific to cre lending focusing on the quality of the developer and the specifics associated with each project generally we 1 limit our loans to 80 of the appraised value of the commercial real estate at origination 2 require net operating cash flows to be 125 of required interest and principal payments and 3 if the commercial real estate is nonowner occupied require that at least 50 of the space of the project be preleased we actively monitor both geographic and projecttype concentrations and performance metrics of all cre loan types with a focus on higherrisk classes both macrolevel and loanlevel stresstest scenarios based on existing and forecast market conditions are part of the ongoing portfolio management process for the cre portfolio  dedicated real estate professionals originated the majority of the portfolio with the remainder obtained from prior bank acquisitions appraisals are obtained from approved vendors and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process the portfolio is diversified by project type and loan size and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio subsequent to the origination of the loan the credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting andor risk of new loan originations  appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals and on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements we continue to perform ongoing portfolio level reviews within the cre portfolio these reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the projects being reviewed property values are updated using appraisals on a regular basis to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the ongoing management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions this highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers as well as an indepth knowledge of cre project lending and the market environment  in 2010 we segregated our cre portfolio into core and noncore segments we believe segregating noncore cre from core cre improved our ability to understand the nature performance prospects and problem resolution opportunities of these segments thus allowing us to continue to deal proactively with any emerging credit issues we have not subsequently originated any noncore cre loans  a cre loan is generally considered core when the borrower is an experienced wellcapitalized developer in our midwest footprint and had either an established meaningful relationship with us that generated an acceptable return on capital or demonstrated the prospect of becoming one the core cre portfolio was 39 billion at december 31 2012 representing 73 of total cre loans the performance of the core portfolio has met our expectations based on the consistency of the asset quality metrics within the portfolio based on our extensive project level assessment process including forwardlooking

december 31 2011 the majority of this decline occurred in the noncore segment and was a result of payoffs and ncos as we actively focus on the noncore portfolio to reduce our overall cre exposure this reduction demonstrates our continued commitment to achieving a materially lower risk profile in the cre portfolio consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile we will continue to support our core developer customers as appropriate however we do not believe that significant additional cre activity is appropriate given the current market conditions  also as shown above substantial reserves for the noncore portfolio have been established at december 31 2012 the acl related to the noncore portfolio was 1300 the combination of the existing acl and prior ncos represents the total credit actions taken on each segment of the portfolio from this data we calculate a credit mark that provides a consistent measurement of the cumulative credit actions

portfolio  consumer credit  consumer credit approvals are based on among other factors the financial strength and payment history of the borrower type of exposure and the transaction structure consumer credit decisions are generally made in a centralized environment utilizing decision models importantly certain individuals who understand each local region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our focus on the local communities we operate in each credit extension is assigned a specific pd and lgd the pd is generally based on the borrowers most recent credit

segment ie loan type collateral position geography etc and vintage performance analysis all portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators we make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio which may result in changes to future origination strategies the ongoing analysis and review process results in a determination of an appropriate alll amount for our consumer loan portfolio the independent risk management group has a consumer process review component to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes  collection action is initiated as needed through a centrally managed collection and recovery function the collection group employs a series of collection methodologies designed to maintain a high level of effectiveness while maximizing efficiency in addition to the consumer loan portfolio the collection group is responsible for collection activity on all sold and securitized consumer loans and leases collection practices include a single contact point for the majority of the residential real estate secured portfolios  effective with the 2012 third quarter we identified certain loans within the consumer portfolio that met the definition of collateral dependent as defined by regulatory guidance as the borrowers had not reaffirmed their debt discharged in a chapter 7 bankruptcy filing the bankruptcy courts discharge of the borrowers debt is considered a concession when the discharged debt is not reaffirmed and as such the loans were classified as tdrs placed on nonaccrual status and written down to collateral value less anticipated selling costs previously we recorded the chargeoff when the loan reached 60days past due and did not classify these loans as tdrs many of these loans were current with many borrowers having paid according to the contractual terms for several years in 2012 this change increased ncos by 346 million nals by 601 million and tdrs by 795 million across the automobile residential mortgage and home equity portfolios  automobile portfolio  our strategy in the automobile loan and lease portfolio continued to focus on high quality borrowers as measured by both fico and internal custom scores combined with appropriate ltvs terms and profitability our strategy and operational capabilities allow us to appropriately manage the origination quality across the entire portfolio including our newer markets although increased origination volume and the entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels we believe our strategy and operational capabilities significantly mitigate these risks  we have continued to consistently execute our value proposition and take advantage of available market opportunities importantly we have maintained our high credit quality standard while growing the portfolio we have developed and implemented a loan securitization strategy to ensure we remain within our established portfolio concentration limits    45    table of contents during 2012 a total of 23 billion of automobile loans were transferred to trusts in two separate securitization transactions additional information regarding these securitization transactions is located in note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  residential real estate secured portfolios  the properties securing our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are primarily located within our geographic footprint the continued stress on home prices has caused the performance in these portfolios to remain weaker than historical levels the residentialsecured portfolio originations continue to be of high quality with the majority of the negative credit impact coming from loans originated in 2006 and earlier we continue to evaluate all of our policies and processes associated with managing these portfolios our loss mitigation and foreclosure activities are consolidated in one location under common management this structure allows us to focus on effectively helping our customers with appropriate solutions for their specific circumstances  table

consists of both firstlien and juniorlien mortgage loans with underwriting criteria based on minimum credit scores debttoincome ratios and ltv ratios we offer closedend home equity loans which are generally fixedrate with principal and interest payments and variablerate interestonly home equity linesofcredit which do not require payment of principal during the 10year revolving period of the lineofcredit applications are underwritten centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system  given the low interest rate environment over the past several years many borrowers have utilized the lineofcredit home equity product as the primary source of financing their home versus residential mortgages during 2012 75 of our home equity portfolio originations were secured by a firstlien mortgage as a result the proportion of the home equity portfolio secured by a firstlien has increased significantly over the past three years positively impacting the portfolios risk profile at december 31 2012 53 of our total home equity portfolio was secured by firstlien mortgages the firstlien position combined with continued high average fico scores significantly reduces the pd associated with these loans  we focus on high quality borrowers primarily located within our footprint further we actively manage the extension of credit and the amount of credit extended through a combination of criteria including financial position debttoincome policies and ltv policy limits the combination of high quality borrowers as measured by financial condition and fico score as well as the concentration of firstlien position loans provides a high degree of confidence regarding the performance of the 20092012 originations because we focus on developing complete relationships with our customers many of our home equity borrowers utilize other products and services also the majority of our home equity lineofcredit borrowers consistently pay more than the minimum payment required in any given month    46    table of contents we believe we have underwritten credit conservatively within this portfolio we have not originated home equity loans or linesofcredit with an ltv at origination greater than 100 except for infrequent situations with high quality borrowers however declines in housing prices have decreased the value of the collateral for this portfolio and have caused a portion of the portfolio to have an ltv greater than 100 these higher ltv ratios are directly correlated with borrower payment patterns and are a focus of our loss mitigation and home saver groups effective in the 2012 third quarter we no longer originate juniorlien loans with an ltv greater than 90  real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended and in the event of default subsequent changes in these values impact the severity of losses we obtain a property valuation for every loan or lineofcredit as part of the origination process and the valuation is reviewed by a real estate professional in conjunction with the credit underwriting process the type of property valuation obtained is based on credit parameters and a majority of these valuations are based on complete walkthrough appraisals we believe an avm estimate with a signed property inspection is an appropriate valuation source for a portion of our home equity lending activities this valuation policy along with our other credit policies are reevaluated on an ongoing basis with the intent of ensuring complete independence in the requesting and reviewing of real estate valuations associated with loan decisions we update values as appropriate and in compliance with applicable regulations particularly for loans identified as higher risk loans are identified as higher risk based on performance indicators and the updated values are utilized to facilitate our portfolio management processes as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions  we continue to make origination policy adjustments based on our assessment of an appropriate risk profile and industry actions as well as the recently issued basel iii nprs see capital section in addition to origination policy adjustments we take actions as necessary to manage the risk profile of this portfolio we believe our credit risk management systems allow for effective portfolio analysis and segmentation to identify the highest risk exposures in the portfolio our disclosures regarding lien position and fico distribution are examples of segmentation analysis  we continue to identify situations where borrowers make a purposeful financial decision to stop making required payments on the juniorlien loan and in some cases the firstlien loan this strategic default scenario is generally associated with borrowers that have very limited or no history of delinquency these accounts also tend to migrate quickly from a current status to chargeoff without exhibiting the historical behaviors at each delinquency stage the resulting increase in the relative speed of the migration from current status to chargeoff represents a negative impact to the longer term performance of the portfolio although the collateral value assessment is an important component of the overall credit risk analysis there are very few instances of available equity in juniorlien default situations further effective in 2012 any juniorlien loan associated with a nonaccruing firstlien loan is also placed on nonaccrual status  within the home equity lineofcredit portfolio the standard product is a 10year interestonly draw period with a 20year fully amortizing term at the end of the draw period prior to 2007 the standard product was a 10year draw period with a balloon payment while subsequent originations convert to a 20year amortizing loan structure after the 10year revolving period the borrower must reapply to extend the existing structure or begin repaying the debt in a traditional term structure the principal and interest payment associated with the term structure will be higher than the interestonly payment resulting in maturity risk this maturity risk is embedded in the portfolio which we address with proactive contact strategies beginning one year prior to maturity in certain circumstances our home saver group is able to provide payment and structure relief to borrowers experiencing significant financial hardship associated with the payment adjustment  the table below summarizes our home equity lineofcredit portfolio by maturity date  table 13maturity schedule of

future periods as our proactive approach to managing maturity risk continues to evolve  residential mortgages portfolio  we focus on higher quality borrowers and underwrite all applications centrally we do not originate residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options we will continue to evaluate the impact of the recently issued basel iii nprs on our residential mortgage origination policies  all residential mortgages are originated based on a completed full appraisal during the credit underwriting process we update values on a regular basis in compliance with applicable regulations to facilitate our portfolio management as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions  generally our practice is to sell a significant portion of our fixedrate originations in the secondary market as such at december 31 2012 50 of our total residential mortgage portfolio were arms these arms primarily consist of a fixedrate of interest for the first 3 to 5 years and then adjust annually at december 31 2012 arm loans that were expected to have rates reset through 2015 totaled 15 billion these loans scheduled to reset are primarily associated with loans originated subsequent to 2007 and as such are not subject to the most significant declines in underlying property value given the quality of our borrowers the relatively low current interest rates and the results of our continued analysis including possible impacts of changes in interest rates we believe that we have a relatively limited exposure to arm reset risk nonetheless we have taken actions to mitigate our risk exposure we initiate borrower contact at least six months prior to the interest rate resetting and have been successful in converting many arms to fixedrate loans through this process given the relatively low current interest rates many fixedrate products currently offer a better interest rate to our arm borrowers  several government programs continued to impact the residential mortgage portfolio including various refinance programs such as hamp and harp which positively affected the availability of credit for the industry during the year ended december 31 2012 we closed 810 million in harp residential mortgages and 19 million in hamp residential mortgages the harp residential mortgage loans are considered current and are either part of our residential mortgage portfolio or serviced for others the hamp refinancings are associated with residential mortgages that are serviced for others we are subject to repurchase risk associated with residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market an appropriate level of reserve for representations and warranties related to residential mortgage loans sold has been established to address this repurchase risk inherent in the portfolio see operational risk discussion   credit quality  this section should be read in conjunction with note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of credit quality performance ratios this approach forms the basis of most of the discussion in the sections immediately following npas and nals tdrs acl and ncos in addition we utilize delinquency rates risk distribution and migration patterns and product segmentation in the analysis of our credit quality performance  credit quality performance in 2012 reflected overall continued improvement nals declined 25 to 4076 million at december 31 2012 compared to december 31 2011

there are times when subsequent modifications are required such as when the modified loan matures often the loans are performing in accordance with the tdr terms and a new note is originated with similar modified terms these loans are subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing if the loan is not performing in accordance with the existing tdr terms typically a more aggressive strategy is put in place in accordance with asc 3102035 the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan a new loan is considered for removal of the tdr designation a continuation of the prior note requires the continuation of the tdr designation and because the refinanced note constitutes a new legal agreement they are included in our tdr activity table below as both a new tdr and a restructured tdr removal during the period  the types of concessions granted are consistent with those granted on new tdrs and include interest rate reductions amortization or maturity date changes beyond what the collateral supports and principal forgiveness based on the borrowers specific needs at a point in time our policy does not limit the number of times a loan may be modified a loan may be modified multiple times if it is considered to be in the best interest of both the borrower and us  loans are not automatically considered to be accruing tdrs upon the granting of a new concession accrual status is determined based on delinquency status and whether collection of principal and interest is in doubt if the loan is not 90days past due and no loss is expected based on the modified terms the modified tdr remains in accruing status for loans that are on nonaccrual status before the modification collection of both principal and interest must not be in doubt and the borrower must be able to exhibit sufficient cash flows for a sixmonth period of time

we maintain two reserves both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the alll and the aulc combined these reserves comprise the total acl our credit administration group is responsible for developing the methodology assumptions and estimates used in the calculation as well as determining the appropriateness of the acl the alll represents the estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reported date additions to the alll result from recording provision expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting from loan riskrating downgrades while reductions reflect chargeoffs net of recoveries decreased risk levels resulting from loan riskrating upgrades or the sale of loans the aulc is determined by applying the transaction reserve process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation  a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the acl to the level we have determined to be appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the provision for credit losses in 2012 was 1474 million compared with 1741 million in 2011  we regularly evaluate the appropriateness of the acl by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above we also consider the impact of collateral value trends and portfolio diversification  our acl evaluation process includes the ongoing assessment of credit quality metrics and a comparison of certain acl benchmarks to current performance while the total acl balance has declined in recent quarters all of the relevant benchmarks remain strong  we have incorporated recent regulatory guidance which focused on home equity loans specifically juniorlien loans when the related firstlien loan is delinquent into our acl adequacy analysis processes as we evaluated this guidance in the context of the continued economic strain on some of our borrowers we determined it was appropriate to assess borrower risk at a more granular level in order to ensure we had identified the incurred risk embedded within our portfolios secured by residential real estate particularly the home equity juniorlien portfolio in addition to the updated fico score for each borrower and the delinquency status of each huntington loan our analysis also considers any nondelinquent huntington loan secured by residential real estate when the borrower has a significant delinquency on the most recent credit bureau report additionally beginning in 2012 a reserve amount

percentages represent the percentage of each loan and lease category to total loans and leases  the reduction in the alll compared with december 31 2011 reflected a decline in all portfolios the declines in the campi and cre alll reflected significant improvements in the level of criticized and classified loans combined with lower cre loan balances the home equity alll declined as a result of a combination of the improving underlying asset quality and our view of expected future performance the residential mortgage alll declined as a result of the improving underlying asset quality while the automobile alll decreased slightly as the underlying asset quality remained relatively consistent  compared with december 31 2011 the aulc decreased 78 million primarily reflecting a significant improvement in the underlying risk profile of the borrowers with unfunded loan commitments  the acl to total loans declined to 199 at december 31 2012 compared to 260 at december 31 2011 we believe the decline in the ratio is appropriate given the continued improvement in the risk profile of our loan portfolio further we believe that early identification of loans with changes in credit metrics and aggressive action plans for these loans combined with originating high quality new loans will contribute to continued improvement in our key credit quality metrics we continue to see positive economic trends within our midwest markets relative to the broader united states nevertheless broad based customer sentiment began to change late in the 2012 fourth quarter as customers have increased concerns regarding the us economy some businesses are hesitant to invest given the current uncertainty in the economy unemployment rates remain high however our footprint large metropolitan statistical areas msa unemployment rates were below the national average as of november 2012  we have significant exposure to loans secured by residential real estate and continue to be an active lender in our communities the impact of the downturn in real estate values over the past several years has had a significant impact on some of our borrowers as evidenced by the higher delinquencies and ncos since late 2007 recently real estate values have begun to slowly rise from their 2007 levels fhfa housing prices increased in the 2012 third quarter relative to the yearago quarter in all of our footprint states except pennsylvania which was essentially unchanged strong affordability and continued economic growth should support continued housing recovery in 2013 as long as risks to the overall us economy are contained  given the combination of these noted positive and negative factors we believe that our acl is appropriate and its coverage level is reflective of the quality of our portfolio and the current operating environment  ncos  this section should be read in conjunction with significant item 5    56    table of contents any loan in any portfolio may be chargedoff prior

of how commercial loans are treated as they deteriorate over time the alll established is consistent with the level of risk associated with the original underwriting as a part of our normal portfolio management process for commercial loans the loan is periodically reviewed and the alll is increased or decreased based on the revised risk rating in certain cases the standard alll is determined to not be appropriate and a specific reserve is established based on the projected cash flow or collateral value of the specific loan chargeoffs if necessary are generally recognized in a period after the specific alll was established if the previously established alll exceeds that necessary to satisfactorily resolve the problem loan a reduction in the overall level of the alll could be recognized consumer loans are treated in much the same manner as commercial loans with increasing reserve factors applied based on the risk characteristics of the loan although specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans in summary if loan quality deteriorates the typical credit sequence would be periods of reserve building followed by periods of higher ncos as the previously established alll is utilized additionally an increase in the alll either precedes or is in conjunction with increases in nals when a loan is classified as nal it is evaluated for specific alll or chargeoff as a result an increase in nals does not necessarily result in an increase in the alll or an expectation of higher future ncos  we anticipate a continuation of the pattern established over the last year of residential mortgage portfolio nco annualized percentages being lower than the home equity portfolio nco annualized percentages as we have focused on originating highquality home equity loans we believe the pd risk is lower in the home equity portfolio however the lgd component is significantly higher than the residential mortgage portfolio which results in our projection for lower ncos in the residential mortgage portfolio relative to the home equity portfolio in the future therefore we believe the residential mortgage nco annualized percentage will remain lower compared to the home equity portfolio as a result of the entire firstlien composition of the residential mortgage portfolio as well as the result of previous credit actions improving the underlying quality of these portfolios  both the home equity and residential mortgage portfolio nco levels are anticipated to remain at elevated levels in the near future the home equity portfolio will continue to be impacted by borrowers that are seeking to refinance but are in a negative equity position because of the juniorlien loan rightsizing and debt forgiveness associated with these situations are becoming more frequent as borrowers realize the impact to their credit is minor and that a default on a juniorlien loan is not likely to cause borrowers to lose their home    58    table of contents all residential mortgage loans greater than 150days past due are chargeddown to the estimated value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs the remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed or the loan goes through the foreclosure process for the home equity portfolio virtually all of the defaults represent full chargeoffs as there is no remaining equity creating a lower delinquency rate but a higher nco impact  2012 versus 2011  campi ncos decreased 255 million or 28 primarily reflecting credit quality improvement in the underlying portfolio as well as our ongoing proactive credit management practices there was not any concentration in either geography or project type  cre ncos decreased 697 million or 47 primarily reflecting credit quality improvement in the underlying portfolio as well as our ongoing proactive credit management practices there was no concentration in either geography or project type the performance of the portfolio was consistent with our expectations  automobile ncos decreased 56 million or 37 despite the 13 million impact of chapter 7 bankruptcy ncos in 2012 the relatively low levels of ncos reflected the continued high credit quality of originations and a strong resale market for used vehicles  home equity ncos increased 146 million or 14 and included 254 million of chapter 7 bankruptcy ncos excluding the impact of the chapter 7 bankruptcy loans the decline in the remaining portion of the portfolio is consistent with our expectations we continue to manage the default rate through focused delinquency monitoring as essentially all defaults for juniorlien home equity loans incur significant losses reflecting the reduction of equity associated with the collateral property  residential mortgage ncos declined 88 million or 15 despite 79 million of chapter 7 bankruptcy ncos the decline reflects improvement in the overall economy compared to the yearago period  market risk  market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities we incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads we have identified two primary sources of market risk interest rate risk and price risk  interest rate risk  overview  huntington actively manages interest rate risk as changes in market interest rates can have a significant impact on reported earnings the interest rate risk process is designed to compare income simulations in market scenarios designed to alter the direction magnitude and speed of interest rate changes as well as the slope of the yield curve these scenarios are designed to illustrate the embedded optionality in the balance sheet from among other things faster or slower mortgage prepayments and changes in deposit mix  income simulation and economic value analysis  interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the alco and roc monthly the information reported includes the identification of any policy limits exceeded along with an assessment that describes the policy limit breach and outlines the action plan and timeline for resolution mitigation or assumption of the risk  huntington uses two approaches to model interest rate risk interest sensitive earnings at risk ise analysis and economic value of equity eve analysis under ise analysis net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets liabilities and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios ise analysis measures the sensitivity of interest sensitive earnings over a one year time horizon market implied forward rates and various likely and extreme interest rate scenarios are used for ise analysis these likely and extreme scenarios include rapid and gradual interest rate ramps rate shocks and yield curve twists  the ise analysis used in the following table reflects the analysis used monthly by management it models gradual 25 100 and 200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates over the next oneyear period beyond the interest rate change implied by the forward yield curve due to the current low level of interest rates the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of 25 basis points the point at which many assets and liabilities reach zero percent    59    table of contents huntington is within board policy limits for the 100 and 200 basis point scenarios there is no policy limit for the 25 basis point scenario the table below shows the results of the scenario as of

asset sensitive meaning that earnings increase decrease when rates rise fall the primary reason for these results is that more assets primarily liborindexed loans to customers than liabilities primarily nonmaturity deposits will reprice over the modeled oneyear period  the following table shows the income sensitivity of selected assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates the table compares the ise analysis for selected huntington portfolios to a portfolio that assumes 100 sensitivity to changes in interest rates we calculate the percent change in interest incomeexpense as the change in the base huntington portfolio divided by the change in the 100 sensitive portfolio  the results for the 100 and 200 basis point ramps also confirm the asset sensitive nature of the portfolio in both the 100 and 200 basis point ramps interest income for total loans 381 and 392 respectively increases faster than interest expense for interest bearing deposits 355 and 370 respectively additionally total borrowings show changes in interest expense of 574 and 602 for 100 and 200 basis point scenarios respectively while these results are high since total borrowings represent a small percentage of total interestsensitive liabilities the financial impact of their sensitivity to rising rates is minimal the 25 basis point parallel ramp confirms the asset sensitive position as the interest income for total loans 97 decreases faster than the interest expense of deposits 69  table 22interest incomeexpense sensitivity                            percent of

economic value of financial assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments is derived through the discounting of cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period the economic value of equity is calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities net of the impact of offbalance sheet instruments  the eve analysis used in the following table

the economic value of equity position will decrease increase since the amount and duration of the assets are longer than the amount and duration of liabilities when interest rates rise fixed rate assets generally lose economic value the longer the duration the greater the value lost the opposite is true when interest rates fall  the following table details the economic value sensitivity to changes in market interest rates at december 31 2012 for loans investments deposits and borrowings the change in economic value for each portfolio is measured as the percent change from the base economic value for that portfolio the analysis reflects that in a sharply higher rate scenario total tangible assets are more sensitive than total tangible liabilities investments and other earning assets contribute to this sensitivity largely due to fixed rate securities investments  table 24economic value sensitivity                            percent of                          total net

representing the right to service 156 billion in mortgage loans of this 1207 million 352 million was recorded using the fair value method and 855 million was recorded using the amortization method  msr fair values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be greatly reduced by prepayments prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise we have employed strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment in addition we engage a third party to provide valuation tools and assistance with our strategies with the objective to decrease the volatility from msr fair value changes however volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these hedges we typically report msr fair value adjustments net of hedgerelated trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking income  msrs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with historically low interest rates resulting in a lower probability of prepayments and ultimately impairment msr assets are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets    61    table of contents price risk  price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and subject to fair value accounting we have price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions equity investments investments in mortgagebacked securities and marketable equity securities held by our insurance subsidiaries we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained and the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held by the insurance subsidiaries  liquidity risk  liquidity risk is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments resulting from external macro market issues investor and customer perception of financial strength and events unrelated to us such as war terrorism or financial institution market specific issues in addition the mix and maturity structure of huntingtons balance sheet amount of cash onhand and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding can have an impact on huntingtons ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments we manage liquidity risk at both the bank and the parent company  the overall objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can obtain costeffective funding to meet current and future obligations and can maintain sufficient levels of onhand liquidity under both normal business as usual and unanticipated stressed circumstances the alco was appointed by our roc to oversee liquidity risk management and the establishment of liquidity risk policies and

2012 total wholesale funding was 52 billion a decrease from 66 billion at december 31 2011 the decrease from prior year primarily relates to a decrease in shortterm borrowings subordinated and other

subsidiaries repurchases of our stock and acquisitions the parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends received from direct subsidiaries net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return fees for services provided to subsidiaries and the issuance of debt securities  at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 the parent company had 09 billion in cash and cash equivalents appropriate limits and guidelines are in place to ensure the parent company has sufficient cash to meet operating expenses and other commitments over the next 18 months without relying on subsidiaries or capital markets for funding  during 2012 huntington redeemed 2303 million of trust preferred securities 1943 million of these redeemed trust preferred securities were redeemed at the redemption price as a percentage of the liquidation amount plus accrued and unpaid distributions to the redemption date and 360 million were redeemed at par value these redemptions were funded from our existing cash and resulted in a net gain of 08 million  on january 17 2013 we announced that the board of directors had declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of 004 per common share the dividend is payable on april 1 2013 to shareholders of record on march 18 2013 based on the current quarterly dividend of 004 per common share cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately 337 million per quarter based on the current dividend cash demands required for series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock are estimated to be approximately 77 million and 03 million respectively per quarter  based on a regulatory dividend limitation the bank could not have declared and paid a dividend to the parent company at december 31 2012 without regulatory approval due to the deficit position of its undivided profits we do not anticipate that the bank will request regulatory approval to pay dividends in the near future as we continue to build bank regulatory capital above its already wellcapitalized level to help meet any additional liquidity needs we have an openended automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the sec which permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities  other parent company obligations due in the next 12 months include a 50 million subordinated note due in april 2013  with the exception of the items discussed above the parent company does not have any significant cash demands it is our policy to keep operating cash on hand at the parent company to satisfy expected cash demands for the next 18 months  we sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees hired or rehired prior to january 1 2010 the plan provides benefits based upon length of service and compensation levels our policy is to contribute an annual amount that is at least equal to the minimum funding requirements the bank and other subsidiaries fund approximately 90 of pension contributions although we contributed a total of 750 million in 2012 there was no required minimum contribution for 2012 funding requirements are calculated annually as of the end of the year and are heavily dependent on the value of our pension plan assets and the interest rate used to discount plan obligations to the extent that the low interest rate environment continues including as a result of the federal reserve maturity extension program or the pension plan does not earn the expected asset return rates annual pension contribution requirements in future years could increase and such increases could be significant any additional pension contributions are not expected to significantly impact liquidity see the contractual obligations table for our pension minimum funding requirement    66    table of contents basel iii includes shortterm liquidity liquidity coverage ratio and longterm funding net stable funding ratio standards the liquidity coverage ratio or lcr is designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain an adequate level of cash or assets that can readily be converted to cash to meet potential shortterm liquidity needs on january 7 2013 the basel committee on banking supervision bcbs issued a final standard on the liquidity coverage ratio the final standard delays full implementation of the lcr partial implementation begins on january 1 2015 with 60 of the high quality liquid assets requirement and increases ratably until full implementation of the lcr effective january 1 2019 the net stable funding ratio which is scheduled to take effect by january 1 2018 is designed to promote a stable maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a oneyear time horizon these requirements are subject to change by our banking regulators  considering the factors discussed above and other analyses that we have performed we believe the parent company has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future  offbalance sheet arrangements  in the normal course of business we enter into various offbalance sheet arrangements these arrangements include financial guarantees contained in standby letters of credit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans  standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements including commercial paper bond financing and similar transactions most of these arrangements mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon standby letters of credit are included in the determination of the amount of riskbased capital that the parent company and the bank are required to hold  through our credit process we monitor the credit risks of outstanding standby letters of credit when it is probable that a standby letter of credit will be drawn and not repaid in full losses are recognized in the provision for credit losses at december 31 2012 we had 5147 million of standby letters of credit outstanding of which 80 were collateralized included in this 5147 million total are letters of credit issued by the bank that support securities that were issued by our customers and remarketed by the huntington investment company our brokerdealer subsidiary  we enter into forward contracts relating to the mortgage banking business to hedge the exposures we have from commitments to extend new residential mortgage loans to our customers and from our mortgage loans held for sale at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 we had commitments to sell residential real

operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error inadequate or failed internal systems and controls violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters and security risks we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations and to improve the oversight of our operational risk for example we actively and continuously monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to efraud and loss of sensitive customer data we constantly evaluate internal systems processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any material losses  to mitigate operational risks we have established a senior management operational risk committee and a senior management legal regulatory and compliance committee the responsibilities of these committees among other duties include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns risks or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues both of these committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the risk management committee additionally potential concerns may be escalated to our roc as appropriate  the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies minimize operational and fraud losses and enhance our overall performance  representation and warranty reserve  we primarily conduct our mortgage loan sale and securitization activity with fnma and fhlmc in connection with these and other securitization transactions we make certain representations and warranties that the loans meet certain criteria such as collateral type and underwriting standards we may be required to repurchase individual loans and  or indemnify these organizations against losses due to a loan not meeting the established criteria we have a reserve for such losses which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities the reserves are estimated based on historical and expected repurchase activity average loss rates and current economic trends the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon economic factors investor demand strategies and other external conditions containing a level of uncertainty and risk that may change over the life of the underlying loans we currently do not have sufficient information to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss related to representation and warranty exposure  the tables below reflect activity in the representations

we service a relatively low volume of residential mortgage foreclosures we have reviewed our residential foreclosure process we have not found evidence of financial injury to any borrowers from any foreclosure by the bank that should not have proceeded we continuously review our processes and controls to ensure that our foreclosure processes are appropriate  compliance risk  financial institutions are subject to several laws rules and regulations at both the federal and state levels these broadbased mandates include but are not limited to expectations relating to antimoney laundering lending limits client privacy fair lending and community reinvestment additionally the volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk as such we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws rules and regulations our colleagues receive training for several broadbased laws and regulations including but not limited to antimoney laundering and customer privacy additionally colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection equal credit opportunity fair lending and  or other courses related to the extension of credit we set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance  capital  this section should be read in conjunction with note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are managed at the bank and on a consolidated basis we have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the companys overall capital adequacy we believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are adequate  regulatory capital  basel iii and the doddfrank act  in june 2012 the frb occ and fdic collectively the agencies each issued nprs that would revise and replace the agencies current capital rules to align with the basel iii capital standards and meet certain requirements of the doddfrank act certain requirements of the nprs would establish more restrictive capital definitions higher riskweightings for certain asset classes capital buffers and higher minimum capital ratios the nprs were in a comment period through october 22 2012 and those comments are currently being evaluated by the agencies in late 2012 the agencies announced that implementation of the basel iii requirements would be delayed as certain aspects of the nprs were to be enacted in 2013  at the time of the npr release we evaluated the impact of the nprs as proposed on our regulatory capital ratios and estimated a reduction of approximately 150 basis points to our basel i tier i common riskbased capital ratio based on our june 30 2012 balance sheet composition we anticipate that our capital ratios on a basel iii basis would continue to exceed the wellcapitalized minimum requirements we are evaluating options to mitigate the capital impact of the nprs and will provide further guidance upon issuance of the final rules by the agencies  capital planning  in connection with its increased focus on the adequacy of regulatory capital and risk management for larger financial institutions the frb requires banks with assets over 500 billion to submit capital plans annually per the frbs rule our submission included a comprehensive capital plan supported by an assessment of expected uses and sources of capital over a given planning time period under a range of expected and stress scenarios we participated in the frbs cappr process and made our 2012 capital plan submission in january 2012 on march 14 2012 we announced that the frb had completed its review of our 2012 capital plan submission and did not object to our proposed capital actions the planned actions included the potential repurchase of up to 1820 million of common stock and a continuation of our current common dividend through the 2013 first quarter    69    table of contents in october 2012 the federal reserve published two final rules with stress testing requirements for certain bank holding companies state member banks and savings and loan holding companies we will be subject to the federal reserves supervisory stress tests beginning in late 2013 however as in the prior year we are subject to cappr and must conduct internal stress testing as part of the completion of our annual capital plan we submitted our 2013 capital plan to the federal reserve on january 7 2013 in accordance with the federal reserves requirements  in october 2012 the occ issued its annual stress test final rule in that ruling the occ stipulated it will consult closely with the federal reserve to provide common stress scenarios for use at both the depository institution and holding company levels the occ has deferred the requirement for us to complete separate annual stress tests at the banklevel until 2013 for additional discussion refer to the updates to risk factors section located in the additional disclosures section of this mdampa  capital adequacy  the frb establishes capital adequacy requirements including wellcapitalized standards for the company the occ establishes similar capital adequacy requirements and standards for the bank regulatory capital primarily consists of tier 1 riskbased capital and tier 2 riskbased capital the sum of tier 1 riskbased capital and tier 2 riskbased capital equals our total riskbased capital  riskbased capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percentage of riskweighted assets riskweighted assets consist of total assets plus certain offbalance sheet and market items subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors throughout 2012 both the company and the bank were wellcapitalized under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  tier 1 common equity a nongaap financial measure is used by banking regulators investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of our capital with the capital of other financial services companies we use tier 1 common equity along with the other capital measures to assess and monitor our capital position tier 1 common equity is defined as tier 1 capital less elements of tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity eg perpetual preferred stock noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and trust preferred capital debt securities  the following table presents riskweighted assets and other financial data necessary to calculate certain financial ratios including the tier 1 common equity ratio which we use

shareholders equity primarily through earnings net of dividends other potential sources of shareholders equity include issuances of common and preferred stock our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives to meet both regulatory and market expectations and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities shareholders equity totaled 58 billion at december 31 2012 representing a 04 billion or 7 increase compared with december 31 2011 primarily due to an increase in retained earnings    71

share repurchases we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares future stock repurchases may be private or openmarket repurchases including block transactions accelerated or delayed block transactions forward transactions and similar transactions various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases including our capital requirements the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions market conditions including the trading price of our stock and regulatory and legal considerations including the frbs response to

price of 636 no shares were repurchased in 2011  other capital matters  tarp capital  in 2011 we fully exited our tarp relationship by repurchasing for 491 million the tenyear warrant we had issued to

have four major business segments retail and business banking regional and commercial banking automobile finance and commercial real estate and wealth advisors government finance and home lending a treasury  other function also includes our insurance business and other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expenses while this section reviews financial performance from a business segment perspective it should be read in conjunction with the discussion of results of operations note 25 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and other sections for a full understanding of our consolidated financial performance  business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions  optimal customer relationship ocr  our ocr initiative is a crossbusiness segment strategy designed to increase overall customer profitability and retention by deepening product and service penetration to consumer and commercial customers we believe this can be accomplished by taking our broad array of services and products and delivering them through a rigorous and disciplined sales management process that is consistent across all business segments and regions it is also supported by robust sales and crossreferral technology  ocr was introduced in late 2009 through 2010 much of the effort was spent on defining processes sales training and systems development to fully capture and measure ocr performance metrics in 2011 we introduced ocrrelated metrics for commercial relationships which complements the previously disclosed consumer ocrrelated metrics in 2012 we continued to experience strong consumer household and commercial relationship growth  consumer ocr performance  for consumer ocr performance there are three key performance metrics 1 the number of checking account households 2 the number of product penetration per consumer checking account household and 3 the revenue generated consumer households from all business segments are included  the growth in consumer checking account number of households is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing checking account households the overall objective is to grow the number of households along with an increase in product penetration  we use the checking account since it typically represents the primary banking relationship product we count additional products by type not number of products for example a household that has one checking account and one mortgage we count as having two services a household with four checking accounts we count as having one service the household relationship utilizing four or more services is viewed to

our emphasis on crosssell coupled with customers increasingly being attracted by the benefits offered through our fair play banking philosophy with programs such as 24hour grace on overdrafts and asteriskfree checking are having a positive effect the percent of consumer households with over four products at the end of 2012 was 783 up from 735 at the end of last year for 2012 consumer checking account households grew 122 total consumer checking account household revenue in 2012 was 9834 million down 77 million or 08 from 2011 household revenue was negatively impacted by a decrease in electronic banking income as a result of the durbin amendment  commercial ocr performance  for commercial ocr performance there are three key performance metrics 1 the number of commercial relationships 2 the number of services penetration per commercial relationship and 3 the revenue generated commercial relationships include relationships from all business segments  the growth in the number of commercial relationships is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing commercial accounts the overall objective is to grow the number of relationships along with an increase in product service distribution  the commercial relationship is defined as a business banking or commercial banking customer with a checking account relationship we use this metric because we believe that the checking account anchors a business relationship and creates the opportunity to increase our crosssell multiple sales of the same type of product are counted as one product the same as consumer  the following table presents commercial relationship ocr metrics  table 38commercial relationship ocr crosssell report                        year ended

relationships we are able to achieve higher product service distribution among our commercial relationships our expanded product offerings allow us to focus not only on the credit driven relationship but leverage these relationships to generate a deeper share of wallet the percent of commercial relationships utilizing over four products at the end of 2012 was 350 up from 314 from the prior year for 2012 commercial relationships grew 92 total commercial relationship revenue in 2012 was 7244 million up 492 million or 73 from 2011 this was primarily driven by increase in loan balances and increased spreads  revenue sharing  revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations  expense allocation  the management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from treasury  other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury  other expenses except those related to our insurance business reported significant items except for the goodwill impairment and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the four business segments      74    table of contents funds transfer pricing ftp  we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to eliminate all interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate and liquidity risk in the treasury  other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury  other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilities and includes an estimate for the cost of liquidity liquidity premium deposits of an indeterminate maturity receive an ftp credit based on a combination of vintagebased average lives and replicating portfolio pool rates other assets liabilities and capital are charged credited with a fouryear moving average ftp rate the denominator in the net interest margin calculation has been modified to add the amount of net funds provided by each business segment for all periods presented  treasury  other  the treasury  other function includes revenue and expense related to our insurance business and assets liabilities and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the four business segments other assets include investment securities and bank owned life insurance the financial impact associated with our ftp methodology as described above is also included  net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios and the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity noninterest income includes insurance income miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments such as bank owned life insurance income and any investment security and trading asset gains or losses noninterest expense includes any insurancerelated expenses as well as certain corporate administrative merger and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments the provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 35 tax rate though our overall effective tax rate is lower as a result treasury  other reflects a credit for income taxes representing the difference between the lower actual effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate used to allocate income taxes to the business segments  the 827 million or 182 year over year increase in net income for treasuryother was primarily the result of the ftp process described above partially offset by an increase in personnel costs  net income by business segment  the segregation of net income by

certain forwardlooking statements including certain plans expectations goals projections and statements which are subject to numerous assumptions risks and uncertainties statements that do not describe historical or current facts including statements about beliefs and expectations are forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor provided by section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995  while there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the forwardlooking statements 1 worsening of credit quality performance due to a number of factors such as the underlying value of collateral that could prove less valuable than otherwise assumed and assumed cash flows may be worse than expected 2 changes in economic conditions including impacts from the implementation of the budget control act of 2011 and the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 as well as the continuing economic uncertainty in the us the european union and other areas 3 movements in interest rates 4 competitive pressures on product pricing and services 5 success impact and timing of our business strategies including market acceptance of any new products or services implementing our fair play banking philosophy 6 changes in accounting policies and principles and the accuracy of our assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements 7 extended disruption of vital infrastructure 8 the final outcome of significant litigation 9 the nature extent timing and results of

decisions regarding practices in the residential mortgage industry including among other things the processes followed for foreclosing residential mortgages  all forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information available at that time we assume no obligation to update forwardlooking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forwardlooking statements were made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by federal securities laws as forwardlooking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance on such statements    94    table of contents nonregulatory capital ratios  in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including         tangible common equity to tangible assets         tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets using basel i and basel iii definitions and         tangible common equity to riskweighted assets using basel i definition  these nonregulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the companys capitalization to other financial services companies these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies these ratios are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap or federal banking regulations as a result these nonregulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company may be considered nongaap financial measures  because there are no standardized definitions for these nonregulatory capital ratios the companys calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies also there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors as a result the company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10k in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure  risk factors  more information on risk is set forth under the heading risk factors included in item 1a and incorporated by reference into this mdampa additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the risk management and capital discussion as well as the regulatory matters section included in item 1 and incorporated by reference into the mdampa  critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates  our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference into this mdampa describes the significant accounting policies we use in our consolidated financial statements  an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below  allowance for credit losses  our acl of 08 billion at december 31 2012 represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risk associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations    95    table of contents in addition bank regulators periodically review our acl and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan chargeoffs any increase in our acl or loan chargeoffs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  goodwill impairment  goodwill is an intangible asset representing the difference between the purchase price of an asset and its fair market value and is created when a company pays a premium to acquire another company we test goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a twostep process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit goodwill impairment exists when a reporting units carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value goodwill is also tested for impairment on an interim basis using the same twostep process as the annual testing if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount  the first step step 1 of impairment testing requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill to its carrying value to identify potential impairment for our annual impairment testing conducted during 2012 we identified four reporting units with goodwill retail and business banking regional and commercial banking wealth advisors government finance and home lending wgh and insurance auto finance and commercial real estate was not subject to impairment testing as it had no goodwill associated with the unit in addition although insurance is included within treasuryother for business segment reporting it was evaluated as a separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing because it had its own separately allocated goodwill resulting from prior acquisitions  for all four reporting units identified in the above paragraph we utilized both income and market approaches to determine the fair value for each reporting unit the income approach was based on discounted cash flows derived from assumptions of balance sheet and income statement activity an internal forecast was developed by considering several longterm key business drivers such as anticipated loan and deposit growth net interest margins and efficiency ratios longterm growth rates were estimated to assist in determining the terminal values the discount rates were estimated based on the capital asset pricing model which considered the riskfree interest rate 20year treasury bonds marketrisk premium equityrisk premium and a companyspecific risk factor the companyspecific risk factor was used to address the uncertainty of growth estimates and earnings projections of management for the market approach revenue earnings and market capitalization multiples of comparable public companies were selected and applied to each reporting units applicable metrics such as book and tangible book values the results of the income and market approaches are combined to arrive at the final calculation of fair value the aggregate fair market value of the reporting units compared with market capitalization indicated an implied premium of 6 at september 30 2012 a control premium analysis indicated that the implied premium was within range of overall premiums observed in the market place all four of the reporting units tested passed step 1  the second step step 2 of impairment testing is necessary only if the reporting unit does not pass step 1 step 2 compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as none of the reporting units failed step 1 step 2 was not applicable during 2012 testing  significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment this judgment includes developing cash flow projections selecting appropriate discount rates identifying relevant market comparables incorporating general economic and market conditions and selecting an appropriate control premium the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value  due to potential economic uncertainties it is possible that our estimates and assumptions may adversely change in the future if our market capitalization decreases we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing or prior to that time if any changes constitute a triggering event  valuation of financial instruments  assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility assets measured at fair value include mortgage loans held for sale availableforsale and trading securities certain securitized automobile loans derivatives and certain securitization trust notes payable at december 31 2012 approximately 84 billion of our assets and 02 billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value in addition to the above mentioned ongoing fair value measurements fair value is also the unit of measure for recording business combinations  at the end of each quarter we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured at fair value as necessary assets or liabilities may be transferred within fair value hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date    96    table of contents where available we use quoted market prices to determine fair value if quoted market prices are not available fair value is determined using either internally developed or independent third party valuation models based on inputs that are either directly observable or derived from market data these inputs include but are not limited to interest rate yield curves option volatilities or option adjusted spreads where neither quoted market prices nor observable market data are available fair value is determined using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on managements expectation that market participants would use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability the determination of appropriate unobservable inputs requires exercise of management judgment a significant portion of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value are measured based on quoted market prices and observable market or independent inputs  the following is a description of the significant estimates used in the valuation of financial assets and liabilities for which quoted market prices and observable market parameters are not available  mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities  our alta private label cmo and pooledtrustpreferred securities portfolios are classified as level 3 and as such use significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the alta and private label cmo securities portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows while the cash flows of our pooledtrustpreferred securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties and are used as a basis for impairment analysis  alta mortgagebacked and privatelabel cmo securities are collateralized by firstlien residential mortgage loans the securities valuation methodology incorporates values obtained from a third party pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and a proprietary pricing model and includes assumptions management believes market participants would use to value the securities under current market conditions the model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds losses recoveries default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures house price depreciation  appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts and discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities with similar collateral structures  pooledtrustpreferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio we engage a third party pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooledtrustpreferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio the pd of each issuer and the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value management evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the third party pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter actual defaults and deferrals in the current period and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with asc 820  derivatives used for hedging purposes  derivatives designated as qualified hedges are tested for hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis assessments are made at the inception of the hedge and on a recurring basis to determine whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item a statistical regression analysis is performed to measure the effectiveness  if based on the assessment a derivative is not expected to be a highly effective hedge or it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge hedge accounting is discontinued as of the quarter the hedge is not highly effective as the statistical regression analysis requires the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are sensitive to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates we consider this a critical accounting estimate  loans held for sale  certain residential mortgage loans are classified as held for sale at origination in which huntington has elected to apply the fair value option the fair value is estimated based on security prices for similar product types  certain consumer and commercial loans are classified as held for sale and are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value the determination of fair value for these consumer receivables is based on security prices for similar product types or discounted expected cash flows which takes into consideration factors such as future interest rates prepayment speeds default and loss curves and market discount rates the determination of fair value for commercial loans takes into account factors such as the location and appraised value of the related collateral as well as the estimated cash flows from realization of the collateral    97    table of contents mortgage servicing rights  retained rights to service mortgage loans are recognized as a separate and distinct asset at the time the loans are sold mortgage servicing rights msrs are initially recorded at fair value at the time the related loans are sold and subsequently remeasured at each reporting date under either the fair value or amortization method any increase or decrease in fair value of msrs accounted for under the fair value method as well as any amortization andor impairment of msrs recorded under the amortization method is reflected in earnings in the period that the changes occur msrs are subject to interest rate risk in that their fair value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment fair value is determined based upon the application of an income approach valuation model based the valuation model maintained by an independent third party incorporates assumptions in estimating future cash flows these assumptions include time decay payoffs and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions the reasonableness of these pricing models is validated on a minimum of a quarterly basis by at least one independent external service broker valuation because the fair values of msrs are significantly impacted by the use of estimates the use of different assumption estimates can result in different estimated fair values of those msrs  pension valuation  pension plan assets consist of mutual funds corporate bonds us government bonds and our common stock investments are accounted for at cost on the trade date and are reported at fair value mutual funds are valued at quoted net asset value our common stock is traded on a national securities exchange and is valued at the last reported sales price  the discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to determine the benefit obligation and pension expense are both significant assumptions actual results may be materially different see note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  contingent liabilities  we are parties to various claims litigation and legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current andor former operations we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a casebycase basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering among other factors the progress of each case or proceeding our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings and the opinions and views of legal counsel litigation exposure represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our control  income taxes  the calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments we have two accruals for income taxes 1 our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal state and local taxing jurisdictions net of any reserve for potential audit issues and is reported as a component of accrued income and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 2 our deferred federal and state income tax and related valuation accounts reported as a component of accrued income and other assets represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under gaap and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under federal and state tax law  in the ordinary course of business we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes the effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws we believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements we review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions in addition we rely on various tax opinions recent tax audits and historical experience  from timetotime we engage in business transactions that may affect our tax liabilities where appropriate we have obtained opinions of outside experts and have assessed the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking into account statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position however changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates implementation of new business strategies resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance such changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position and  or results of operations see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements    98    table of contents deferred tax assets  at december 31 2012 we had a net federal deferred tax asset of 1715 million and a net state deferred tax asset of 324 million a valuation allowance is provided when it is morelikelythannot that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized all available evidence both positive and negative was considered to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence impairment should be recognized our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change if our forecast of taxable income within the carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets such assets may be impaired based on our analysis of both positive and negative evidence and our ability to offset the net deferred tax assets against our forecasted future taxable income there was no impairment of the net deferred tax assets at december 31 2012  recent accounting pronouncements and developments  note 2 to consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2012 and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affect financial condition results of operations or liquidity the impacts are discussed in the applicable section of this mdampa and the notes to consolidated financial statements
