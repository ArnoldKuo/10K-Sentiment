greater capital and in some cases lower cost structures in addition competition for quality customers has intensified as a result of changes in regulation advances in technology and product delivery systems consolidation among financial service providers bank failures and the conversion of certain former investment banks to bank holding companies  regulatory matters  we are subject to regulation by the sec the federal reserve the occ the cfpb and other federal and state regulators  because we are a public company we are subject to regulation by the sec the sec has established five categories of issuers for the purpose of filing periodic and annual reports under these regulations we are considered to be a large accelerated filer and as such must comply with sec accelerated reporting requirements    7    table of contents we are a bank holding company and are qualified as a financial holding company with the federal reserve we are subject to examination and supervision by the federal reserve pursuant to the bank holding company act we are required to file reports and other information regarding our business operations and the business operations of our subsidiaries with the federal reserve  the federal reserve maintains a bank holding company rating system that emphasizes risk management introduces a framework for analyzing and rating financial factors and provides a framework for assessing and rating the potential impact of nondepository entities of a holding company on its subsidiary depository institutions a composite rating is assigned based on the foregoing three components but a fourth component is also rated reflecting generally the assessment of depository institution subsidiaries by their principal regulators the bank holding company rating system which became effective in 2005 applies to us the composite ratings assigned to us like those assigned to other financial institutions are confidential and may not be disclosed except to the extent required by law  on december 17 2012 the federal reserve issued supervisory letter sr 1217 which sets forth an updated framework for the consolidated supervision of large financial institutions including bank holding companies with consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the objectives of the new framework are to enhance the resilience of a firm lower the probability of its failure and reduce the impact on the financial system in the event of an institutions failure with regard to resiliency each firm is expected to ensure that the consolidated organization and its core business lines can survive under a broad range of internal or external stresses this requires financial resilience by maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity and operational resilience by maintaining effective corporate governance risk management and recovery planning with respect to lowering the probability of failure each firm is expected to ensure the sustainability of its critical operations and banking offices under a broad range of internal or external stresses this requires among other things effective resolution planning that addresses the complexity and the interconnectivity of the firms operations  the bank which is chartered by the occ is a national bank and our only bank subsidiary it is subject to examination and supervision by the occ and by the cfpb established by the doddfrank act our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to examination and supervision by the federal reserve or in the case of nonbank subsidiaries of the bank by the occ our subsidiaries are subject to examination by other federal and state agencies including in the case of certain securities and investment management activities regulation by the sec and the financial industry regulatory authority  the bank is subject to affiliate transaction restrictions under federal law which limit certain transactions generally involving the transfer of funds by a subsidiary bank or its subsidiaries to its parent corporation or any nonbank subsidiary of its parent corporation whether in the form of loans extensions of credit investments or asset purchases or otherwise undertaking certain obligations on behalf of such affiliates furthermore covered transactions which are loans and extensions of credit must be secured within specified amounts in addition all covered transactions and other affiliate transactions must be conducted on a market terms basis and under circumstances that are substantially the same as such transactions with unaffiliated entities  legislative and regulatory reforms continue to have significant impacts throughout the financial services industry  the doddfrank act which is complex and broad in scope established the cfpb which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services and the financial stability oversight council which has oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk in addition the doddfrank act alters the authority and duties of the federal banking and securities regulatory agencies implements certain corporate governance requirements for all public companies including financial institutions with regard to executive compensation proxy access by shareholders and certain whistleblower provisions and restricts certain proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks and their affiliates the doddfrank act also requires the issuance of many implementing regulations which will take effect over several years making it difficult to anticipate the overall impact to us our customers or the financial industry in general  with the appointment of a director for the cfpb in january 2012 the cfpb began to exercise its full authority under the doddfrank act for example the cfpb completed its first public enforcement actions regarding unfair deceptive or abusive practices in connection with marketing sales and operation of certain addon products offered in connection with credit cards furthermore in 2012 the cfpb issued its first major regulation which covers remittance transfers international wire transfers by consumers which will take effect later in 2013  in midjanuary 2013 the cfpb issued eight final regulations governing consumer mortgage lending the first of these rules was issued on january 10 2013 and included the ability to repay and qualified mortgage rule this rule will impose additional requirements on lenders including rules designed to require lenders to ensure borrowers ability to repay their mortgage the same day the cfpb also finalized a rule on escrow accounts for highcost mortgages and a rule expanding the scope of the highcost mortgage provision in the truth in lending act on january 17 2013 the cfpb issued its final rules implementing provisions of the doddfrank act that relate to mortgage servicing which will take effect on january 10 2014 on january 18 2013 the cfpb issued a final appraisal rule under the equal credit opportunity act and six agencies including the cfpb frb occ fdic ncua and fhfa issued an interagency rule on appraisals for higherpriced mortgage loans a final rule on loan originator compensation was released on january 20 2013 and the industry expects a final rule on integrated mortgage disclosures within the next year we are evaluating these rules to determine their impact on the bank and its affiliates    8    table of contents our tier 1 riskbased capital will be negatively impacted by the collins amendment provisions of the doddfrank act  the collins amendment provision of the doddfrank act imposes increased capital requirements in the future the collins amendment also requires federal banking regulators to establish minimum leverage and riskbased capital requirements to apply to insured depository institutions bank and thrift holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial companies these capital requirements must not be less than the generally applicable risk based capital requirements and the generally applicable leverage capital requirements as of july 21 2010 and must not be quantitatively lower than the requirements that were in effect for insured depository institutions as of july 21 2010 the collins amendment defines generally applicable risk based capital requirements and generally applicable leverage capital requirements to mean the riskbased capital requirements and minimum ratios of tier 1 riskbased capital to average total assets respectively established by the appropriate federal banking agencies to apply to insured depository institutions under the prompt corrective action provisions regardless of total consolidated asset size or foreign financial exposure over a three year phaseout period trust preferred securities will no longer qualify as tier 1 riskbased capital for certain bank holding companies including us the collins amendment stipulates that this phase out period begins in 2013 we have plans in place including trust preferred securities redemption to minimize the impact of this amendment on us  large bank holding companies are now required to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve and conduct stress tests  the federal reserve published final amendments to regulation y to require large bank holding companies to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and to require such bank holding companies to obtain approval from the federal reserve under certain circumstances before making a capital distribution this rule applies to us and all other bank holding companies with 50 billion or more of total consolidated assets the first capital plans required under these rules were due on january 9 2012 capital plans for 2013 were required to be submitted on january 7 2013 a large bank holding companys capital plan must include an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over at least the next nine quarters a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon a detailed description of the entitys process for assessing capital adequacy the entitys capital policy and a discussion of any expected changes to the banking holding companys business plan that are likely to have a material impact on the firms capital adequacy or liquidity the federal reserve will either object to a capital plan in whole or in part or provide a notice of nonobjection no later than march 31 2013 for plans submitted by the january 7 2013 submission date if the federal reserve objects to a capital plan the bank holding company may not make any capital distribution other than those with respect to which the federal reserve has indicated its nonobjection while we can give no assurances as to the outcome or specific interactions with the regulators based on the capital plan we submitted on january 7 2013 we believe we have a strong capital position  the federal reserve fdic and occ banking regulators issued proposed rules to implement section 165 of the doddfrank act which requires financial institutions with total consolidated assets of more than 10 billion covered banks to conduct certain stress tests on an annual basis the federal reserve issued their final capital plan rule in late 2011 and updated instructions in november of 2012 for bhcs that did not participate in the 2009 supervisory capital assessment but are required to submit under the capital plan rule as part of the annual capital plan review cappr 2013 huntington participated as a cappr bhc in 2012 and 2013 the doddfrank act requires these regulations to define the term stress test establish methodologies for the conduct of the stress tests that measure the tier 1 common riskbased capital ratio under at least three different sets of conditions including baseline adverse and severely adverse conditions establish the form and content of a required regulatory report on the stress tests and require covered banks to publish a summary of the results of their stress tests for the purposes of the cappr 2013 bhcs were required to submit the results of stress tests based on two supervisory scenarios at least one stressed scenario developed by the bhc and a bhc baseline scenario we submitted our capital plan to the federal reserve on january 7 2013 which included the impact to tier 1 common riskbased capital and total riskbased capital ratios  the regulatory capital rules indicate that common stockholders equity should be the dominant element within tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on noncommon equity elements under the doddfrank act the ratio of tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets became significant as a measurement of the predominance of common equity in tier 1 capital and an indication of the quality of capital  rules have been proposed to implement the volcker rule  in october 2011 the federal reserve issued proposed rules to implement the volcker rule required by the doddfrank act the volcker rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates from i engaging in proprietary trading and ii investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds covered funds subject to certain limited exceptions these prohibitions are expected to impact the ability of us banking organizations to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with nonus banking organizations in overseas markets the proposed rules would also effectively prohibit shortterm trading strategies by any us banking organization if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for trading we do not anticipate that impacts of the proposed rules will be material to our results of operations or financial position    9    table of contents the rules effecting debit card interchange fees under the durbin amendment which became effective on october 1 2011 have negatively impacted our electronic banking income  the durbin amendment required the federal reserve to establish a cap on the rate merchants pay banks for electronic clearing of debit transactions ie the interchange rate the federal reserve issued final rules effective october 1 2011 for establishing standards including a cap for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions the final rule established standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers were reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions under the final rule the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction a 1 cent fraud prevention adjustment and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction as a result of implementing this lower debit card interchange fee structure our electronic banking income during 2012 was negatively impacted by over 55 million when compared to 2011  there are restrictions on our ability to pay dividends  dividends from the bank to the parent company are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders however there are statutory limits on the amount of dividends that the bank can pay to the holding company regulatory approval is required prior to the declaration of any dividends in an amount greater than its undivided profits or if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus or common stock as a result of the deficit position of its undivided profits for the year ended december 31 2012 the bank could not have declared and paid any cash dividends to the parent company without regulatory approval  since the first quarter of 2008 the bank has requested and received occ approval each quarter for a capital reduction to enable payment of periodic dividends to shareholders outside the banks consolidated group on preferred and common stock of its reit and capital financing subsidiaries a whollyowned nonbank subsidiary of the parent company owns a portion of the preferred shares of the reit and capital financing subsidiaries with the exception of the reit and capital financing subsidiary dividends we do not anticipate that the bank will declare dividends to the holding company during 2013  if in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice such authority may require after notice and hearing that such bank cease and desist from such practice depending on the financial condition of the bank the applicable regulatory authority might deem us to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice if the bank were to pay dividends the federal reserve and the occ have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings additionally the federal reserve may prohibit bank holding companies from making any capital distributions including payment of preferred and common dividends if the federal reserve objects to the annual capital plan  we are subject to the current capital requirements mandated by the federal reserve  the federal reserve sets riskbased capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies under the guidelines and related policies bank holding companies must maintain capital sufficient to meet both a riskbased asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis the riskbased ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet commitments into four weighted categories with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived as representing greater risk the riskbased ratio represents total capital divided by total riskweighted assets the leverage ratio is core capital divided by total assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines the bank is subject to substantially similar capital requirements banking regulators are finalizing changes to capital requirements that are expected to incorporate many of the basel iii capital requirements  generally under the currently applicable guidelines a financial institutions capital is divided into two tiers institutions that must incorporate market risk exposure into their riskbased capital requirements may also have a third tier of capital in the form of restricted shortterm subordinated debt these tiers are            tier 1 riskbased capital or core capital which includes total equity plus qualifying capital securities and minority interests excluding unrealized gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income and nonqualifying intangible and servicing assets            tier 2 riskbased capital or supplementary capital which includes among other things cumulative and limitedlife preferred stock mandatory convertible securities qualifying subordinated debt and the acl up to 125 of riskweighted assets            total riskbased capital is the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 riskbased capital    10    table of contents the federal reserve and the other federal banking regulators require that all intangible assets net of deferred tax except originated or purchased msrs nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships intangible assets be deducted from tier 1 capital however the total amount of these items included in capital cannot exceed 100 of its tier 1 capital  under the riskbased guidelines to remain adequatelycapitalized financial institutions are required to maintain a total riskbased capital ratio of 8 with 4 being tier 1 riskbased capital the appropriate regulatory authority may set higher capital requirements when they believe an institutions circumstances warrant  under the leverage guidelines financial institutions are required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 3 the minimum ratio is applicable only to financial institutions that meet certain specified criteria including excellent asset quality high liquidity low interest rate risk exposure and the highest regulatory rating financial institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4  failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the financial institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities these include limitations on the ability to pay dividends the issuance by the regulatory authority of a directive to increase capital and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic in addition the financial institution could be subject to the measures described below under prompt corrective action as applicable to undercapitalized institutions  the riskbased capital standards of the federal reserve the occ and the fdic specify that evaluations by the banking agencies of a banks capital adequacy will include an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of a banks capital due to changes in interest rates these banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active oversight of risk management activities by senior management  fdicia requires federal banking regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements for these purposes fdicia establishes five capital tiers wellcapitalized adequatelycapitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized  throughout 2012 our regulatory capital ratios and those of the bank were in excess of the levels established for wellcapitalized institutions an institution is deemed to be wellcapitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of 10 or greater a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 6 or greater and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 5 or greater and is not subject to a regulatory order agreement or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure                                    at december 31 2012     dollar amounts in billions   wellcapitalized minimums     actual

greater than the wellcapitalized minimum percentage  fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a cash dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would become undercapitalized after such payment undercapitalized institutions are also subject to growth limitations and are required by the appropriate federal banking agency to submit a capital restoration plan if any depository institution subsidiary of a holding company is required to submit a capital restoration plan the holding company would be required to provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of such plan    11    table of contents depending upon the severity of the under capitalization the undercapitalized institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequatelycapitalized requirements to reduce total assets cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks and restrictions on making any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming so classified  under fdicia a depository institution that is not wellcapitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market since the bank is wellcapitalized the fdicia brokered deposit rule did not adversely affect its ability to accept brokered deposits the bank had 16 billion of such brokered deposits at december 31 2012  in june 2012 the frb occ and fdic collectively the agencies each issued notices of proposed rulemaking nprs that would revise and replace the agencies current capital rules to align with the basel iii capital standards and meet certain requirements of the doddfrank act certain requirements of the nprs would establish more restrictive capital definitions higher riskweightings for certain asset classes capital buffers and higher minimum capital ratios the nprs were in a comment period through october 22 2012 and those comments are currently being evaluated by the agencies  at the time of the npr release we evaluated the impact of the nprs as proposed on our regulatory capital ratios and we estimated a reduction of approximately 150 basis points to our basel i tier i common riskbased capital ratio based on our june 30 2012 balance sheet composition we anticipate that our capital ratios on a basel iii basis would continue to exceed the wellcapitalized minimum requirements we are evaluating options to mitigate the capital impact of the nprs and will provide further guidance upon issuance of final rules by the agencies  as a bank holding company we must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the bank and the bank is subject to affiliate transaction restrictions  under the doddfrank act a bank holding company must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and must commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank the federal reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank it may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the federal reserve believes might jeopardize the bank holding companys ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank  any loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy an appointed bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank moreover the bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institutions general unsecured creditors including the holders of its note obligations  federal law permits the occ to order the prorata assessment of shareholders of a national bank whose capital stock has become impaired by losses or otherwise to relieve a deficiency in such national banks capital stock this statute also provides for the enforcement of any such prorata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of capital stock by sale to the extent necessary of the capital stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to pay the assessment as the sole shareholder of the bank we are subject to such provisions  moreover the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expenses and the claims of holders of deposit liabilities of such an institution are accorded priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors of such an institution including the holders of the institutions note obligations in the event of liquidation or other resolution of such institution claims of a receiver for administrative expenses and claims of holders of deposit liabilities of the bank including the fdic as the insurer of such holders would receive priority over the holders of notes and other senior debt of the bank in the event of liquidation or other resolution and over our interests as sole shareholder of the bank  as a financial holding company we are subject to additional laws and regulations  in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company a bank holding companys depository subsidiaries must all be both wellcapitalized and wellmanaged and must meet their community reinvestment act obligations  financial holding company powers relate to financial activities that are specified in the bank holding company act or determined by the federal reserve in coordination with the secretary of the treasury to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity provided that the complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness risk the
