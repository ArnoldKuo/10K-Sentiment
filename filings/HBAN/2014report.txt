areas greater capital and in some cases lower cost structures in addition competition for quality customers has intensified as a result of changes in regulation advances in technology and product delivery systems consolidation among financial service providers bank failures and the conversion of certain former investment banks to bank holding companies  regulatory matters  we are subject to regulation by the sec the federal reserve the occ the cfpb and other federal and state regulators  because we are a public company we are subject to regulation by the sec the sec has established five categories of issuers for the purpose of filing periodic and annual reports under these regulations we are considered to be a large accelerated filer and as such must comply with sec accelerated reporting requirements  we are a bank holding company and are qualified as a financial holding company with the federal reserve we are subject to examination and supervision by the federal reserve pursuant to the bank holding company act we are required to file reports and other information regarding our business operations and the business operations of our subsidiaries with the federal reserve    7    table of contents the federal reserve maintains a bank holding company rating system that emphasizes risk management introduces a framework for analyzing and rating financial factors and provides a framework for assessing and rating the potential impact of nondepository entities of a holding company on its subsidiary depository institutions the ratings assigned to us like those assigned to other financial institutions are confidential and may not be disclosed except to the extent required by law  the federal reserve utilizes an updated framework for the consolidated supervision of large financial institutions including bank holding companies with consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the objectives of the framework are to enhance the resilience of a firm lower the probability of its failure and reduce the impact on the financial system in the event of an institutions failure with regard to resiliency each firm is expected to ensure that the consolidated organization and its core business lines can survive under a broad range of internal or external stresses this requires financial resilience by maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity and operational resilience by maintaining effective corporate governance risk management and recovery planning with respect to lowering the probability of failure each firm is expected to ensure the sustainability of its critical operations and banking offices under a broad range of internal or external stresses this requires among other things effective resolution planning that addresses the complexity and the interconnectivity of the firms operations  the bank which is chartered by the occ is a national bank and our only bank subsidiary it is subject to examination and supervision by the occ and also by the cfpb which was established by the doddfrank act in 2010 our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to examination and supervision by the federal reserve or in the case of nonbank subsidiaries of the bank by the occ all subsidiaries are subject to examination and supervision by the cfpb to the extent they offer any consumer financial products or services our subsidiaries are subject to examination by other federal and state agencies including in the case of certain securities and investment management activities regulation by the sec and the financial industry regulatory authority  the bank is subject to affiliate transaction restrictions under federal law which limit certain transactions generally involving the transfer of funds by a bank or its subsidiaries to its parent corporation or any nonbank subsidiary of its parent corporation whether in the form of loans extensions of credit investments or asset purchases or otherwise undertaking certain obligations on behalf of such affiliates see also the volcker rule discussion below for additional affiliate transaction restrictions  legislative and regulatory reforms continue to have significant impacts throughout the financial services industry  the doddfrank act enacted in 2010 is complex and broad in scope and several of its provisions are still being implemented the doddfrank act established the cfpb which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services and the financial stability oversight council which has oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk in addition the doddfrank act altered the authority and duties of the federal banking and securities regulatory agencies implemented certain corporate governance requirements for all public companies including financial institutions with regard to executive compensation proxy access by shareholders and certain whistleblower provisions and restricted certain proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks and their affiliates the doddfrank act also required the issuance of numerous implementing regulations many of which have not yet been issued the regulations will continue to take effect over several more years continuing to make it difficult to anticipate the overall impact to us our customers or the financial industry in general  in midjanuary 2013 the cfpb issued eight final regulations governing mainly consumer mortgage lending the first of these rules was issued on january 10 2013 and included the ability to repay and qualified mortgage rule this rule imposes additional requirements on lenders including rules designed to require lenders to ensure borrowers ability to repay their mortgage and took effect january 10 2014 the same day the cfpb also finalized a rule on escrow accounts for higher priced mortgage loans and a rule expanding the scope of the highcost mortgage provision in the truth in lending act on january 17 2013 the cfpb issued its final rules implementing provisions of the doddfrank act that relate to mortgage servicing which took effect on january 10 2014 on january 18 2013 the cfpb issued a final appraisal rule under the equal credit opportunity act and six agencies including the cfpb frb occ fdic ncua and fhfa issued an interagency rule on appraisals for higherpriced mortgage loans on november 20 2013 the cfpb issued its final rule on integrated mortgage disclosures under the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act for which compliance is required by august 1 2015 we are evaluating these integrated mortgage disclosure rules to determine their impact on the bank and its affiliates  during the 2013 first quarter the cfpb provided guidance on fair lending practices to indirect automobile lenders with recommendations to ensure compliance with fair lending laws  recently banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address unethical or otherwise bad business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law prior to the doddfrank act there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with the unfair or deceptive acts or practices udap law however the udap provisions have been expanded under the doddfrank act to apply to unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices which has been delegated to the cfpb for supervision    8    table of contents large bank holding companies and national banks are required to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve and occ respectively and conduct stress tests  the federal reserve published final amendments to regulation y to require large bank holding companies to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and to require such bank holding companies to obtain approval from the federal reserve under certain circumstances before making a capital distribution this rule applies to us and all other bank holding companies with 50 billion or more of total consolidated assets  a large bank holding companys capital plan must include an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over at least the next nine quarters a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon a detailed description of the entitys process for assessing capital adequacy the entitys capital policy and a discussion of any expected changes to the banking holding companys business plan that are likely to have a material impact on the firms capital adequacy or liquidity the planning horizon for the most recent capital planning and stress testing cycle encompasses the 2013 fourth quarter through the 2015 fourth quarter as was submitted in our capital plan in january 2014 rules to implement the basel iii capital reforms in the united states were finalized in july 2013 and will be phasedin beginning in 2015 for us under the standardized approach as such the most recent ccar cycle which began october 1 2013 overlaps with the implementation of the basel iii capital reforms based on the required nine quarter projection horizon the interim final rules clarify that banking organizations with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including us must incorporate the revised capital framework into the capital planning projections and into the stress tests required under the doddfrank act the rule also clarifies that for the upcoming cycle capital adequacy at large banking organizations including us would continue to be assessed against a minimum 5 percent tier 1 common ratio as calculated by the federal reserve  capital plans for 2014 were required to be submitted by january 6 2014 the federal reserve will either object to a capital plan in whole or in part or provide a notice of nonobjection no later than march 31 2014 for plans submitted by the january 6 2014 submission date if the federal reserve objects to a capital plan the bank holding company may not make any capital distributions other than those with respect to which the federal reserve has indicated its nonobjection while we can give no assurances as to the outcome or specific interactions with the regulators based on the capital plan we submitted on january 5 2014 we believe we have a strong capital position and that our capital adequacy process is robust  in addition to the ccar submission section 165 of the doddfrank act requires that national banks like the huntington national bank conduct annual stress tests for submission in january 2014 the results of the stress tests will provide the occ with forwardlooking information that will be used in bank supervision and will assist the agency in assessing a companys risk profile and capital adequacy we submitted our stress test results to the occ on january 6 2014  the regulatory capital rules indicate that common stockholders equity should be the dominant element within tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on noncommon equity elements under the doddfrank act the ratio of tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets became significant as a measurement of the predominance of common equity in tier 1 capital and an indication of the quality of capital  final rules have been issued to implement the volcker rule  on december 10 2013 the federal reserve the occ the fdic the cftc and the sec issued final rules to implement the volcker rule contained in section 619 of the doddfrank act generally to become effective on july 21 2015 the volcker rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates referred to as banking entities from i engaging in proprietary trading and ii investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds covered funds subject to certain limited exceptions these prohibitions impact the ability of us banking entities to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with nonus banking organizations in overseas markets the rule also effectively prohibits shortterm trading strategies by any us banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for trading  the final volcker rule regulations do provide certain exemptions allowing banking entities to continue underwriting marketmaking and hedging activities and trading certain government obligations as well as various exemptions and exclusions from the definition of covered funds the level of required compliance activity depends on the size of the banking entity and the extent of its trading ceos of larger banking entities including huntington will have to attest annually in writing that their organization has in place processes to establish maintain enforce review test and modify compliance with the volcker rule regulations banking entities with significant permitted trading operations will have to report certain quantitative information beginning between june 30 2014 and december 31 2016 depending on the size of the banking entitys trading assets and liabilities  on january 14 2014 the five federal agencies approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of the volcker rule under the interim final rule the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities if certain qualifications are met in addition the agencies released a nonexclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of    9    table of contents  the interim final rule at december 31 2013 we had investments in ten different pools of trust preferred securities eight of our pools are included in the list of nonexclusive issuers we have analyzed the other two pools that were not included on the list and believe that we will continue to be able to own these investments under the final volcker rule regulations  the rules effecting debit card interchange fees under the durbin amendment which became effective on october 1 2011 have negatively impacted our electronic banking income  the durbin amendment which was section 1075 of the doddfrank act required the federal reserve to establish a cap on the rate merchants pay banks for electronic clearing of debit transactions ie the interchange rate the federal reserve issued final rules effective october 1 2011 for establishing standards including a cap for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions the final rule established standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers were reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions under the final rule the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction a 1 cent fraud prevention adjustment and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction as a result of implementing this lower debit card interchange fee structure our electronic banking income was negatively impacted by over 55 million in 2012 when compared to 2011  on july 31 2013 the federal district court in the district of columbia issued a ruling in a lawsuit filed by a merchant group challenging the validity of the federal reserves final rule under the durbin amendment the court ruling vacated the provisions of the federal reserves final rule relating to standards for debit card interchange fees and the provision dealing with network nonexclusivity but stayed its action until further briefing on issues identified by the court eventually the district courts ruling was appealed to the federal circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia where the case is currently pending if the court of appeals rules in favor of the merchants the federal reserve will likely be required to provide even more stringent caps on debit interchange fees which could adversely impact all banks that issue debit cards including us and which could result in an industrywide retraction of debit card products and replacement with other card products not subject to the durbin amendment the federal reserve and a banking trade organization are submitting briefs arguing that the court of appeals should overrule the district court and uphold the federal reserves final rule under the durbin amendment oral argument before the court of appeals was held on january 17 2014 and an expedited ruling is anticipated  there are restrictions on our ability to pay dividends  dividends from the bank to the parent company are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders however there are statutory limits on the amount of dividends that the bank can pay to the holding company regulatory approval is required prior to the declaration of any dividends in an amount greater than its undivided profits or if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus or common stock as a result of the deficit position of its undivided profits prior to december 31 2013 the bank could not have declared and paid any cash dividends to the parent company without regulatory approval  since the first quarter of 2008 the bank has made a capital reduction each quarter to enable payment of periodic dividends to shareholders outside the banks consolidated group on preferred and common stock of its reit and capital financing subsidiaries we anticipate that those subsidiaries and the bank will be able to resume normal dividend payments during the first half of 2014  if in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice such authority may require after notice and hearing that such bank cease and desist from such practice depending on the financial condition of the bank the applicable regulatory authority might deem us to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice if the bank were to pay dividends the federal reserve and the occ have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings additionally the federal reserve may prohibit bank holding companies from making any capital distributions including payment of preferred and common dividends if the federal reserve objects to the annual capital plan  we are subject to the current capital requirements mandated by the federal reserve and final capital rules to implement basel iii that were adopted in july 2013  the federal reserve sets riskbased capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies under the guidelines and related policies bank holding companies must maintain capital sufficient to meet both a riskbased asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis the riskbased ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet commitments into four weighted categories with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived as representing greater risk the riskbased ratio represents total capital divided by total riskweighted assets the leverage ratio is core capital divided by total assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines the bank is subject to substantially similar capital requirements    10    table of contents on july 2 2013 the federal reserve voted to adopt final capital rules implementing basel iii requirements for us banking organizations the final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the united states the basel iii regulatory capital reforms from the basel committee on banking supervision and certain changes required by the doddfrank act under the final rule minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations consistent with the international basel framework the final rule includes a new minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital tier i common to riskweighted assets and a tier 1 common capital conservation buffer of 25 of riskweighted assets that will apply to all supervised financial institutions the rule also raises the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4 for all banking organizations these new minimum capital ratios will become effective for us on january 1 2015 and will be fully phasedin on january 1 2019  following are the basel iii regulatory capital levels that we must satisfy to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments during the applicable transition period from january 1 2015 until january 1 2019                                basel iii regulatory capital levels        january 12015     january 12016     january 12017     january 12018     january 12019

  925       9875       105    the final rule emphasizes tier 1 common capital the most lossabsorbing form of capital and implements strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments the final rule also improves the methodology for calculating riskweighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity banks and regulators use risk weighting to assign different levels of risk to different classes of assets  we have evaluated the impact of the basel iii final rule on our regulatory capital ratios and estimate a reduction of approximately 60 basis points to our basel i tier i common riskbased capital ratio based on our june 30 2013 balance sheet composition the estimate is based on managements current interpretation expectations and understanding of the final us basel iii rules we anticipate that our capital ratios on a basel iii basis will continue to exceed the well capitalized minimum capital requirements we are evaluating options to mitigate the capital impact of the final rule prior to its effective implementation date  based on our review of the basel iii final rule it is likely that when basel iii becomes effective the hpci class c preferred securities will no longer constitute tier 1 capital for us or the bank as such we determined that a regulatory capital event had occurred based on an opinion of counsel rendered by a law firm experienced in such matters and the hpci board of directors determined to redeem the outstanding class c preferred securities hpci redeemed all 50 million of the class c preferred securities on december 31 2013 the holders of such securities received the redemption price of 2500 per share  based on the final basel iii rule banking organizations with more than 15 billion in total consolidated assets are required to phaseout of additional tier 1 capital any nonqualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred shares issued before september 12 2010 we will begin the additional tier i capital phaseout our trust preferred securities in 2015 but will be able to include these instruments in tier ii capital as a nonadvanced approaches institution  generally under the currently applicable guidelines a financial institutions capital is divided into two tiers institutions that must incorporate market risk exposure into their riskbased capital requirements may also have a third tier of capital in the form of restricted shortterm subordinated debt these tiers are            tier 1 riskbased capital or core capital which includes total equity plus qualifying capital securities and minority interests excluding unrealized gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income and nonqualifying intangible and servicing assets            tier 2 riskbased capital or supplementary capital which includes among other things cumulative and limitedlife preferred stock mandatory convertible securities qualifying subordinated debt and the acl up to 125 of riskweighted assets            total riskbased capital is the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 riskbased capital  the federal reserve and the other federal banking regulators require that all intangible assets net of deferred tax except originated or purchased msrs nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships intangible assets be deducted from tier 1 capital however the total amount of these items included in capital cannot exceed 100 of its tier 1 capital  under the riskbased guidelines to remain adequatelycapitalized financial institutions are required to maintain a total riskbased capital ratio of 8 with 4 being tier 1 riskbased capital the appropriate regulatory authority may set higher capital requirements when they believe an institutions circumstances warrant    11    table of contents under the leverage guidelines financial institutions are required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 3 the minimum ratio is applicable only to financial institutions that meet certain specified criteria including excellent asset quality high liquidity low interest rate risk exposure and the highest regulatory rating financial institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4  failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the financial institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities these include limitations on the ability to pay dividends the issuance by the regulatory authority of a directive to increase capital and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic in addition the financial institution could be subject to the measures described below under prompt corrective action as applicable to undercapitalized institutions  the riskbased capital standards of the federal reserve the occ and the fdic specify that evaluations by the banking agencies of a banks capital adequacy will include an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of a banks capital due to changes in interest rates these banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active oversight of risk management activities by senior management  fdicia requires federal banking regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements for these purposes fdicia establishes five capital tiers wellcapitalized adequatelycapitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized  throughout 2013 our regulatory capital ratios and those of the bank were in excess of the levels established for wellcapitalized institutions an institution is deemed to be wellcapitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of 10 or greater a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 6 or greater and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 5 or greater and is not subject to a regulatory order agreement or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure

percentage  fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a cash dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would become undercapitalized after such payment undercapitalized institutions are also subject to growth limitations and are required by the appropriate federal banking agency to submit a capital restoration plan if any depository institution subsidiary of a holding company is required to submit a capital restoration plan the holding company would be required to provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of such plan  depending upon the severity of the under capitalization the undercapitalized institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequatelycapitalized requirements to reduce total assets cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks and restrictions on making any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming so classified  under fdicia a depository institution that is not wellcapitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market since the bank is wellcapitalized the fdicia brokered deposit rule did not adversely affect its ability to accept brokered deposits the bank had 16 billion of such brokered deposits at december 31 2013    12    table of contents as a bank holding company we must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the bank and the bank is subject to affiliate transaction restrictions  under the doddfrank act a bank holding company must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and must commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank the federal reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank it may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the federal reserve believes might jeopardize the bank holding companys ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank  any loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy an appointed bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank moreover the bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institutions general unsecured creditors including the holders of its note obligations  federal law permits the occ to order the prorata assessment of shareholders of a national bank whose capital stock has become impaired by losses or otherwise to relieve a deficiency in such national banks capital stock this statute also provides for the enforcement of any such prorata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of capital stock by sale to the extent necessary of the capital stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to pay the assessment as the sole shareholder of the bank we are subject to such provisions  moreover the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expenses and the claims of holders of deposit liabilities of such an institution are accorded priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors of such an institution including the holders of the institutions note obligations in the event of liquidation or other resolution of such institution claims of a receiver for administrative expenses and claims of holders of deposit liabilities of the bank including the fdic as the insurer of such holders would receive priority over the holders of notes and other senior debt of the bank in the event of liquidation or other resolution and over our interests as sole shareholder of the bank  as a financial holding company we are subject to additional laws and regulations  in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company a bank holding companys depository subsidiaries must all be both wellcapitalized and wellmanaged and must meet their community reinvestment act obligations  financial holding company powers relate to financial activities that are specified in the bank holding company act or determined by the federal reserve in coordination with the secretary of the treasury to be financial in nature incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity provided that the complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness risk in addition we are required by the bank holding company act to obtain federal reserve approval prior to acquiring directly or indirectly ownership or control of voting shares of any bank if after such acquisition we would own or control more than 5 of its voting stock furthermore the doddfrank act added a new provision to the bank holding company act which requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than 50 billion to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve to acquire a nondepository company having total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more  we also must comply with antimoney laundering and customer privacy regulations as well as corporate governance accounting and reporting requirements  the usa patriot act of 2001 and its related regulations require insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing federal banking regulators are required when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering activities of the applicants  pursuant to title v of the grammleachbliley act we like all other financial institutions are required to            provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and practices            inform our customers regarding the conditions under which their nonpublic personal information may be disclosed to nonaffiliated third parties and            give our customers an option to prevent certain disclosure of such information to nonaffiliated third parties  the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 imposed new or revised corporate governance accounting and reporting requirements on us in addition to a requirement that chief executive officers and chief financial officers certify financial statements in writing the statute imposed requirements affecting among other matters the composition and activities of audit committees disclosures relating to corporate insiders and insider transactions code of ethics and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting    13    table of

multifaceted approach to risk governance it begins with the board of directors defining our risk appetite in aggregate as moderatetolow this does not preclude engagement in select higher risk activities rather the definition is intended to represent an average of where we want our overall risk to be managed  two board committees primarily oversee implementation of this desired risk profile the audit committee and the risk oversight committee            the audit committee is principally involved with overseeing the integrity of financial statements providing oversight of the internal audit department and selecting our external auditors our chief auditor reports directly to the audit committee chair            the risk oversight committee supervises our risk management processes which primarily cover credit market liquidity operational compliance legal strategic and reputational risks it also approves the charters of executive risk management committees sets risk limits on certain risk measures eg economic value of equity receives results of the risk selfassessment process and routinely engages management in review of key risks our credit review executive reports directly to the risk oversight committee  both committees are comprised of independent directors and routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and risk management on a periodic basis the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both such as the construct and appropriateness of the acl which is reviewed quarterly all directors have access to information provided to each committee and all scheduled meetings are open to all directors  further through its compensation committee the board of directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards is risksensitive and aligns the interests of management creditors and shareholders we utilize a variety of compensationrelated tools to induce appropriate behavior including common stock ownership thresholds for the chief executive officer and certain members of senior management a requirement to hold until retirement a portion of net shares received upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards 50 for executive officers and 25 for other award recipients equity deferrals recoupment provisions and the right to terminate compensation plans at any time  management has introduced a number of steps to help ensure an aggregate moderatetolow risk appetite is maintained foremost is a quarterly selfassessment process in which each business segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls the segment analyses are combined with assessments by our risk management organization of major risk sectors eg credit market operational reputational compliance etc to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment outcomes of the process include a determination of the quality of the overall control process the direction of risk and our position compared to the defined risk appetite  management also utilizes a wide series of metrics key risk indicators to monitor risk positions throughout the company in general a range for each metric is established which allows the company in aggregate to maintain its moderatetolow risk profile deviations from the range will indicate if the risk being measured is moving which may then necessitate corrective action  we also have four other executive level committees to manage risk alco credit policy and strategy risk management and capital management each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature we believe this structure helps ensure appropriate elevation of issues and overall communication of strategies    14    table of contents huntington utilizes three levels of defense with regard to risk management 1 business segments 2 corporate risk management and 3 internal audit and credit review to induce greater ownership of risk within its business segments segment risk officers have been embedded to identify and monitor risk elevate and remediate issues establish controls perform selftesting and oversee the quarterly selfassessment process segment risk officers report directly to the related segment manager with a dotted line to the chief risk officer corporate risk management establishes policies sets operating limits reviews new or modified productsprocesses ensures consistency and quality assurance within the segments and produces the enterprise risk assessment the chief risk officer has significant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans as they apply to risk internal audit and credit review provide additional assurance that riskrelated functions are operating as intended  risk overview  we like other financial companies are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations many of which are outside of our direct control though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns among the risks assumed are 1 credit risk which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms 2 market risk which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads 3 liquidity risk which is a the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external macro market issues investor and customer perception of financial strength and events unrelated to us such as war terrorism or financial institution market specific issues and b the risk of loss based on our ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments due to the mix and maturity structure of our balance sheet amount of onhand cash and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding 4 operational and legal risk which is the risk of loss due to human error inadequate or failed internal systems and controls violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters and security risks and 5 compliance risk which exposes us to money penalties enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws rules and regulations that apply to the financial services industry  we also expend considerable effort to contain risk which emanates from execution of our business strategies and work relentlessly to protect the companys reputation strategic risk and reputational risk do not easily lend themselves to traditional methods of measurement rather we closely monitor them through processes such as new product  initiative reviews frequent financial performance reviews employee and client surveys monitoring market intelligence periodic discussions between management and our board and other such efforts  in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report readers should carefully consider that the following important factors among others could negatively impact our business future results of operations and future cash flows materially  credit risks  1 our acl level may prove to be inappropriate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could materially adversely affect our net income and capital  our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers our acl of 7108 million at december 31 2013 represented managements estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we periodically review our acl for appropriateness in doing so we consider economic conditions and trends collateral values and credit quality indicators such as past chargeoff experience levels of past due loans and npas there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases if the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  in addition bank regulators periodically review our acl and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan chargeoffs any increase in our acl or loan chargeoffs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  2 weakness in economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business  our performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us our customers and our counterparties these conditions could result in one or more of the following            a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us      15    table of contents         a decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us and            an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us  an increase in the number of delinquencies bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of npas ncos provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale the markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and thus are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors  market risks  1 changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income reduce transactional income and negatively impact the value of our loans securities and other assets this could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows financial condition results of operations and capital  our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions conditions such as inflation deflation recession unemployment money supply and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates if our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment net interest income could be materially adversely impacted likewise if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment net interest income could be adversely impacted  changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans securities assets under management and other assets including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights an increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in npas and a reduction of income recognized which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows when we place a loan on nonaccrual status we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable which decreases interest income however we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding nals without any corresponding interest income in addition transactional income including trust income brokerage income and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from periodtoperiod based on a number of factors including the interest rate environment  rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixedrate debt securities and cash flow hedging derivatives portfolio any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts oci shareholders equity and the tangible common equity ratio any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios notably tier i and total riskbased capital ratios in a rising interest rate environment pension and other postretirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative oci impacts from securities and financial instruments  certain investment securities notably mortgagebacked securities are very sensitive to rising and falling rates generally when rates rise prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will increase conversely when rates fall prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will decrease in either case interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgagebacked securities investments  liquidity risks  1 if we lose access to capital markets we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors creditors and borrowers or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities  liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost the bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers the board of directors establishes liquidity policies and limits and management establishes operating guidelines for liquidity  wholesale funding sources include securitization federal funds purchased securities sold under repurchase agreements noncore deposits and medium and longterm debt the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank of cincinnati which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgagerelated assets we maintain a portfolio of highlyrated marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity    16    table of contents capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of the bank and corporation the inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations cash flows and level of regulatoryqualifying capital we may from timetotime consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions  2 due to the losses that the bank incurred in 2008 and 2009 prior to december 31 2013 the bank and its subsidiaries could not declare and pay dividends to the holding company any subsidiary of the holding company outside the banks consolidated group or any security holder outside the banks consolidated group without regulatory approval also the bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits  dividends from the bank to the parent company are the primary source of funds for the payment of dividends to our shareholders under applicable statutes and regulations a national bank may not declare and pay dividends in any year greater than its undivided profits or in excess of an amount equal to the sum of the total of the net income of the bank for that year and the retained net income of the bank for the preceding two years minus the sum of any transfers required by the occ and any transfers required to be made to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock unless the occ approves the declaration and payment of dividends in excess of such amount the banks undivided profits were in a deficit position until december 2013 we anticipate that the bank will declare dividends to the holding company during the first half of 2014  operational and legal risks  1 the resolution of significant pending litigation if unfavorable could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period  we face legal risks in our businesses and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters if unfavorable may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period  note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements updates the status of litigation concerning cyberco holdings inc although the bank maintains litigation reserves related to this case the ultimate resolution of the matter if unfavorable may be material to our results of operations for a particular reporting period  2 we face significant operational risks which could lead to expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and capital markets  we are exposed to many types of operational risks including cyberattack risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders unauthorized transactions by employees or outsiders or operational errors by employees including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems these operational risks could lead to expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and the capital markets  moreover negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including lending practices corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action  relative to acquisitions we cannot

or our accounts loss can occur as a result of negative customer experience in the event of a successful denial of service attack that disrupts availability of our online banking services the attempts to breach sensitive customer data such as account numbers and social security numbers could present significant reputational legal andor regulatory costs to us if successful our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers our plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers    17    table of contents 3 failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting

concentration limits and increased competition for projects sponsored by high quality developers average loans heldforsale decreased reflecting the impact of automobile securitizations completed in 2012 and no such securitizations in 2013    24    table of contents noninterest income was 10 billion in 2013 a 9 decrease compared with 2012 mortgage banking income was down 642 million due to a reduction in volume lower gain on sale margin and a higher percentage of originations held on the balance sheet in addition gains on sale of loans were down 400 million due to no auto securitizations in 2013 service charges increased 96 million in 2013 despite a decrease of approximately 28 million due to a change that we made in february 2013 on posting order for our consumer transaction accounts  noninterest expense was 18 billion in 2013 a 4 decrease compared with 2012 the decrease was primarily due to lower marketing deposit and other insurance professional services and other expense as we actively managed the pace and size of investment other expense declined due to lower mortgage repurchase and warranty and oreo and foreclosure expenses this was partially offset by franchise repositioning expense related significant items included in net occupancy 121 million personnel costs 67 million equipment 24 million outside data processing and other services 14 million and other expense 10 million the increase in personnel costs primarily related to the increase in the number of average fulltime equivalent employees was partially offset by a significant item of 339 million from the pension curtailment gain  most credit quality related metrics in 2013 reflected continued improvement nals declined 856 million or 21 from 2012 to 3221 million or 075 of total loans and leases npas declined 936 million or 21 compared to a yearago to 3522 million or 082 of total loans and leases oreo and other npas the decreases primarily reflected meaningful improvement in both cre and campi nals the provision for credit losses decreased 573 million or 39 from 2012 due to the continued decline in classified criticized and nonaccrual loans and included the implementation of enhancements to our alll model ncos decreased 1538 million or 45 from the prior year to 1887 million ncos were an annualized 045 of average loans and leases in the current year compared to 085 in 2012 within the consumer portfolio ncos related to chapter 7 bankruptcy loans amounted to 228 million in 2013 and 346 million in 2012 the acl as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 165 from 199 a year ago while the acl as a percentage of periodend total nals increased to 221 from 199  the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio at december 31 2013 was 883 up 7 basis points from a year ago our tier 1 common riskbased capital ratio at year end was 1090 up from 1048 at the end of 2012 the regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital ratio at december 31 2013 was 1228 up from 1202 at december 31 2012 the increase in the regulatory tier 1 riskbased capital ratio reflected the increase in retained earnings partially offset by the redemption of 50 million of qualifying reit preferred securities in the 2013 fourth quarter and growth in riskweighted assets all capital ratios were impacted by the repurchase of 17 million common shares over the last four quarters none of which were repurchased during the 2013 fourth quarter we have the ability to repurchase up to 136 million additional shares of common stock through the first quarter of 2014 we intend to continue disciplined repurchase activity consistent with our annual capital plan our capital return objectives and market conditions  business overview  general  our general business objectives are 1 grow net interest income and fee income 2 increase crosssell and shareofwallet across all business segments 3 improve efficiency ratio 4 continue to strengthen risk management including sustained improvements in credit metrics and 5 maintain strong capital and liquidity positions  in 2013 we grew our base of consumer and business customers while achieving positive operating leverage our performance in the second half of 2013 demonstrates strong business momentum positioning us well for 2014 highlights of our financial strength in 2013 include a strong balance sheet ongoing deposit growth and quality loan growth in commercial and auto lending our deposit and lending growth is the result of focused execution and key strategic investments made over the last four years we have done all of this while decreasing expenses by 4 percent year over year as the result of disciplined expense management  we continue to face strong competition from other banks and financial service firms in our markets to address these challenges the cornerstone of our strategy has been to invest in the franchise in order to grow our market share and shareofwallet in this regard our ocr methodology continued to deliver success in 2013 consumer checking account households grew by 96 thousand households or 8 over the last year commercial relationships grew at a rate of 6 and have increased by 9 thousand commercial customers since 2012 our fair play philosophy combined with continued ocr success positively impacted results in 2013  economy  the environment in 2013 was different than we thought it would be when we started the year as the economic interest rate and political environments were more challenging currently we are seeing good momentum going into 2014 as customers seem to have a slightly better mindset as the political environment seems to be less of an issue and the general economic outlook is more positive as evidenced by the following            although slower than the national growth rate of 174 aggregate employment growth in our footprint states remained positive at 089 over the 12 month period ended october 2013      25    table of contents         according to the philadelphia frb coincident economic activity index michigan indiana and ohio outperformed the nation in the economic recovery to date and prospects for growth over the next six months appear positive            industrial vacancy rates have shown declining trends in our large footprint msas            consistent with longterm trends housing prices have been rising broadly across our footprint over 2013 and have tended to be more stable than the national average  legislative and regulatory  a comprehensive discussion of legislative and regulatory matters affecting us can be found in the regulatory matters section included in item 1 of this form 10k  2014 expectations  net interest income is expected to moderately increase we anticipate an increase in earning assets as total loans moderately grow and investment securities remain near current levels however those benefits to net interest income are expected to be mostly offset by continued downward pressure on nim while we are maintaining a disciplined approach to loan pricing asset yields remain under pressure but the continued opportunity of deposit repricing remains albeit closer to current levels  the campi portfolio is expected to grow consistent with the anticipated increase in customer activity our campi loan pipeline remains robust with much of this reflecting the positive impact from our investments in specialized commercial verticals automotive dealer relationships focused ocr sales process and continued support of middle market and small business lending automobile loan originations remain strong and we currently do not anticipate any automobile securitizations in the near future residential mortgages home equity and cre loan balances are expected to increase modestly  we anticipate the increase in total loans will modestly outpace growth in total deposits this reflects our continued focus on the overall cost of funds through the issuance of longterm debt as well as the continued shift towards low and nocost demand deposits and money market deposit accounts  noninterest income excluding the impact of any net msr activity is expected to be slightly lower than recent levels due to the anticipated decline in mortgage banking revenues and the continued refinement of products under our fair play philosophy  noninterest expense excluding the net 10 million of benefit from significant items we experienced in 2013 is expected to remain around current levels we are committed to delivering positive operating leverage for the 2014 full year  npas are expected to show continued improvement this year ncos represented the midpoint of our expected normalized range of 35 to 55 basis points the level of provision for credit losses was below our longterm expectation and we continue to expect moderate quarterly volatility  the effective tax rate for 2014 is expected to be in the range of 25 to 28 primarily reflecting the impacts of taxexempt income taxadvantaged

contents discussion of results of operations  this section provides a review of financial performance from a consolidated perspective it also includes a significant items section that summarizes key issues important for a complete understanding of performance trends key consolidated balance sheet and income statement trends are discussed all earnings per share data is reported on a diluted basis for additional insight on financial performance please read this section in conjunction with the business segment discussion  significant items  definition of significant items  from timetotime revenue expenses or taxes are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities and  or by items that while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or shortterm in nature we refer to such items as significant items most often these significant items result from factors originating outside the company eg regulatory actions  assessments windfall gains changes in accounting principles onetime tax assessments  refunds litigation actions etc in other cases they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of business eg merger  restructuring charges recapitalization actions goodwill impairment etc  even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions as a general rule volatility alone does not define a significant item for example changes in the provision for credit losses gains  losses from investment activities asset valuation writedowns etc reflect ordinary banking activities and are therefore typically excluded from consideration as a significant item  we believe the disclosure of significant items provides a better understanding of our performance and trends to ascertain which of such items if any to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance ie within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations as well as how if at all to adjust estimates of future performance accordingly to this end we adopted a practice of listing significant items in our external disclosure documents eg earnings press releases investor presentations forms 10q and 10k  significant items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance  significant items influencing financial performance comparisons  earnings comparisons among the three years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were impacted by a number of significant items summarized below        1

state deferred tax asset valuation allowance adjustment during 2012 a valuation allowance of 213 million net of tax was released for the portion of the deferred tax asset and state net operating loss

is net interest income which is the difference between interest income from earning assets primarily loans securities and direct financing leases and interest expense of funding sources primarily interestbearing deposits and borrowings earning asset balances and related funding sources as well as changes in the levels of interest rates impact net interest income the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interestbearing liabilities is the net interest spread noninterestbearing sources of funds such as demand deposits and shareholders equity also support earning assets the impact of the noninterestbearing sources of funds often referred to as free funds is captured in the net interest margin which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a fullytaxable equivalent basis which means that taxfree interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income assuming a 35 tax rate    29    table of contents the following table shows changes in fullytaxable equivalent interest income interest expense and net interest income due to

versus 2012  the provision for income taxes was 2158 million for 2013 compared with a provision for income taxes of 1841 million in 2012 both years included the benefits from taxexempt income taxadvantaged investments and general business credits in 2013 a 60 million reduction in the 2013 provision for state income taxes net of federal was recorded for the portion of state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards that are more likely than not to be realized compared to a 213 million reduction in 2012 at december 31 2013 we had a net federal and state deferred tax asset of 1376 million based on both positive and negative evidence and our level of forecasted future taxable income we determined no impairment existed to the net federal and state deferred tax asset at december 31 2013 for regulatory capital purposes there was no disallowed net deferred tax asset at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012  we file income tax returns with the irs and various state city and foreign jurisdictions federal income tax audits have been completed for tax years through 2009 in the first quarter of 2013 the irs began an examination of our 2010 and 2011 consolidated federal income tax returns we have appealed certain proposed adjustments resulting from the irs examination of our 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 tax returns we believe the tax positions taken related to such proposed adjustments are correct and supported by applicable statutes regulations and judicial authority and intend to vigorously defend them it is possible the ultimate resolution of the proposed adjustments if unfavorable may be material to the results of operations in the period it occurs nevertheless although no assurances can be given we believe the resolution of these examinations will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position various state and other jurisdictions remain open to examination including kentucky indiana michigan pennsylvania west virginia and illinois  on september 13 2013 the irs released final tangible property regulations under sections 162a and 263a of the irc and proposed regulations under section 168 of the irc these regulations generally apply to taxable years beginning on or after january 1 2014 and will affect all taxpayers that acquire produce or improve tangible property based upon preliminary analysis we do not expect that the adoption of these regulations will have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements  2012 versus 2011  the provision for income taxes was 1841 million for 2012 compared with a provision of 1646 million in 2011 both years included the benefits from taxexempt income taxadvantaged investments and

governance section included in item 1a and the regulatory matters section of item 1 of this form 10k  some of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit market liquidity operational and compliance risks are described in the following paragraphs    37    table of contents credit risk  credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending we also have credit risk associated with our afs and htm securities portfolio see note 4 and note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management mortgage banking and trading activities while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity we believe this exposure is minimal  we continue to focus on the identification monitoring and managing of our credit risk in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes market risk management activities and portfolio diversification we use additional quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources enhanced use of modeling technology and internal stress testing processes our portfolio management resources demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk profile in our efforts to continue to identify risk mitigation techniques we have focused on product design features origination policies and treatment strategies for delinquent or stressed borrowers  the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers all authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type geography industry and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives although we offer a broad set of products we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk portfolio profile  the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution for example we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage position to that end we continue to expand resources in our risk management areas  although credit quality improved significantly in 2013 there remained a degree of economic stress that continued to negatively impact us and the financial services industry as a whole we continued to experience higher than historical levels of delinquencies and ncos in our residential secured consumer loan portfolios the performance metrics associated with the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios continued to be the most significantly impacted portfolios as real estate prices remain lower than pre2008 levels and the unemployment rate remains high  loan and lease credit exposure mix  at december 31 2013 our loans and leases totaled 431 billion representing a 24 billion or 6 increase compared to 407 billion at december 31 2012 the majority of the portfolio growth occurred in the automobile portfolio with campi and residential showing modest growth huntington remained committed to the high quality origination strategy in the automobile portfolio the cre portfolio declined as a result of continued runoff as acceptable returns for new originations were balanced against internal concentration limits and increased competition for projects sponsored by high quality developers  total commercial loans were 224 billion at december 31 2013 and represented 52 of our total loan and lease credit exposure our commercial loan portfolio is diversified along product type customer size and geography within our footprint and is comprised of the following see commercial credit discussion  campi  campi loans and leases are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs equipment purchases or other projects the majority of these borrowers are customers doing business within our geographic regions campi loans and leases are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company andor the personal guarantee of the business owners the financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a campi loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral this treatment is a result of the credit decision process which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt the operation sale rental or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans as we have expanded our campi portfolio we have developed a series of verticals to ensure that new products or lending types are embedded within a structured centralized commercial lending area with designated experienced credit officers    38    table of contents cre  cre loans consist of loans to developers and reits supporting incomeproducing or forsale commercial real estate properties we mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement these loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings office and industrial buildings and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation sale or refinance of the property  construction cre

financing of the property our construction cre portfolio primarily consists of retail multi family office and warehouse project types generally these loans are for construction projects that have been presold or preleased or have secured permanent financing as well as loans to real estate companies with significant equity invested in each project these loans are underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate lending group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule  total consumer loans and leases were 207 billion at december 31 2013 and represented 48 of our total loan and lease credit exposure the consumer portfolio is comprised primarily of automobile home equity loans and

borrowers management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process we utilize a centralized preview and senior loan approval committee led by our chief credit officer the risk rating see next paragraph and complexity of the credit determines the threshold for approval of the senior loan committee with a minimum credit exposure of 100 million for loans not requiring senior loan committee approval with the exception of small business loans credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority for small business loans we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures in this centralized decision environment certain individuals who understand each local region may make creditextension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities we operate in in addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval process  in commercial lending ongoing credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan we monitor all significant exposures on an ongoing basis all commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrowers pd and lgd this twodimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process the pd is rated and applied at the borrower level the lgd is rated and applied based on the specific type of credit extension and the quality and lien position associated with the underlying collateral the internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each periodic    40    table of contents  monitoring event there is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an ongoing basis we continually review and adjust our riskrating criteria based on actual experience which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate allowance for credit losses acl amount for the commercial portfolio a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio including small business loans to provide consistent oversight  in addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and  or risk of new loan originations this group is part of our risk management area and conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of credit processes  our standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment one of which is guarantor support on an annual basis or more frequently if warranted we consider among other things the guarantors reputation and creditworthiness along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth assuming such information is available our assessment of the guarantors credit strength or lack thereof is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans which is directly tied to and an integral component of our acl methodology when a loan goes to impaired status viable guarantor support is considered in the determination of a credit loss  if our assessment of the guarantors credit strength yields an inherent capacity to perform we will seek repayment from the guarantor as part of the collection process and have done so successfully however we do not formally track the repayment success from guarantors  substantially all loans categorized as classified see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements are managed by our special assets department sad the sad group is a specialized group of credit professionals that handle the daytoday management of workouts commercial recoveries and problem loan sales its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans assessing risk ratings and determining the appropriateness of the allowance the accrual status and the ultimate collectability of the classified loan portfolio  campi portfolio  the campi portfolio is comprised of loans to businesses where the source of repayment is associated with the ongoing operations of the business generally the loans are secured with the financing of the borrowers assets such as equipment accounts receivable andor inventory in many cases the loans are secured by real estate although the operation sale or refinancing of the real estate is not a primary source of repayment for the loan for loans secured by real estate appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements  there were no commercial loan segments considered an industry or geographic concentration of lending currently higherrisk segments of the campi portfolio include loans to borrowers supporting the home building industry contractors and leveraged lending we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio through origination policies a defined loan concentration policy with established limits ongoing loan level reviews and portfolio level reviews recourse requirements and continuous portfolio risk management activities our origination policies for this portfolio include loan producttype specific policies such as ltv and debt service coverage ratios as applicable  the campi portfolio continues to have strong origination activity as evidenced by the growth over the past 12 months the credit quality of the portfolio continues to improve as we maintain focus on high quality originations problem loans have trended downward reflecting a combination of proactive risk identification and effective workout strategies implemented by the sad we continue to maintain a proactive approach to identifying borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty in order to maximize the potential solutions  cre portfolio  we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio specific to cre lending focusing on the quality of the developer and the specifics associated with each project generally we 1 limit our loans to 80 of the appraised value of the commercial real estate at origination 2 require net operating cash flows to be 125 of required interest and principal payments and 3 if the commercial real estate is nonowner occupied require that at least 50 of the space of the project be preleased we actively monitor both geographic and projecttype concentrations and performance metrics of all cre loan types with a focus on loans identified as higher risk based on the risk rating methodology both macrolevel and loanlevel stresstest scenarios based on existing and forecast market conditions are part of the ongoing portfolio management process for the cre portfolio    41    table of contents dedicated real estate professionals originated the majority of the portfolio with the remainder obtained from prior bank acquisitions appraisals are obtained from approved vendors and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process the portfolio is diversified by project type and loan size and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio subsequent to the origination of the loan the credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting andor risk of new loan originations  appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals and on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements we continue to perform ongoing portfolio level reviews within the cre portfolio these reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the projects being reviewed property values are updated using appraisals on a regular basis to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the ongoing management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions this highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers as well as an indepth knowledge of cre project lending and the market environment  consumer credit  consumer credit approvals are based on among other factors the financial strength and payment history of the borrower type of exposure and the transaction structure consumer credit decisions are generally made in a centralized environment utilizing decision models importantly certain individuals who understand each local region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our focus on the local communities we operate in each credit extension is assigned a specific pd and lgd the pd is generally based on the borrowers most recent credit bureau score fico which we update quarterly while the lgd is related to the type of collateral and the ltv ratio associated with the credit extension  in consumer lending credit risk is managed from a segment ie loan type collateral position geography etc and vintage performance analysis all portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators we make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio which may result in changes to future origination strategies the ongoing analysis and review process results in a determination of an appropriate alll amount for our consumer loan portfolio the independent risk management group has a consumer process review component to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes  collection action is initiated as needed through a centrally managed collection and recovery function the collection group employs a series of collection methodologies designed to maintain a high level of effectiveness while maximizing efficiency in addition to the consumer loan portfolio the collection group is responsible for collection activity on all sold and securitized consumer loans and leases collection practices include a single contact point for the majority of the residential real estate secured portfolios  during a 2013 review of our consumer portfolios we identified additional loans associated with borrowers who had filed chapter 7 bankruptcy and had not reaffirmed their debt thus meeting the definition of collateral dependent per occ regulatory guidance these loans were not identified in the 2012 third quarter implementation of the occs regulatory guidance the bankruptcy courts discharge of the borrowers debt is considered a concession when the discharged debt is not reaffirmed and as such the loan is placed on nonaccrual status and written down to collateral value less anticipated selling costs as a result of the review of our existing consumer portfolios additional ncos of 228 million were recorded in 2013 the majority of the nco impact was in the home equity portfolio and relates to juniorlien loans that meet the regulatory guidance  automobile portfolio  our strategy in the automobile portfolio continued to focus on high quality borrowers as measured by both fico and internal custom scores combined with appropriate ltvs terms and profitability our strategy and operational capabilities allow us to appropriately manage the origination quality across the entire portfolio including our newer markets although increased origination volume and entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels we believe our disciplined strategy and operational processes significantly mitigate these risks  we have continued to consistently execute our value proposition and take advantage of available market opportunities importantly we have maintained our high credit quality standard while expanding the portfolio we have developed and implemented a successful loan securitization strategy to ensure we remain within our established portfolio concentration limits    42    table of contents residential real estate secured portfolios  the properties securing our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are primarily located within our geographic footprint while home prices have clearly rebounded from the 20092010 levels they remain below the peak causing the performance in these portfolios to remain weaker than historical levels the residentialsecured portfolio originations continue to be of high quality with the majority of the negative credit impact coming from loans originated in 2006 and earlier we continue to evaluate all of our policies and processes associated with managing these portfolios our portfolio management strategies associated with our home savers group are consolidated in one

of loan origination    3 represents only ownedportfolio originations  home equity portfolio  our home equity portfolio loans and linesofcredit consists of both firstlien and juniorlien mortgage loans with underwriting criteria based on minimum credit scores debttoincome ratios and ltv ratios we offer closedend home equity loans which are generally fixedrate with principal and interest payments and variablerate interestonly home equity linesofcredit which do not require payment of principal during the 10year revolving period of the lineofcredit applications are underwritten centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system  given the low interest rate environment over the past several years many borrowers have utilized the lineofcredit home equity product as the primary source of financing their home versus residential mortgages the proportion of the home equity portfolio secured by a firstlien has increased significantly over the past three years positively impacting the portfolios risk profile at december 31 2013 48 billion or 58 of our total home equity portfolio was secured by firstlien mortgages compared to 52 in the prior year the firstlien position combined with continued high average fico scores significantly reduces the credit risk associated with these loans  we focus on high quality borrowers primarily located within our footprint further we actively manage the extension of credit and the amount of credit extended through a combination of criteria including financial position debttoincome policies and ltv policy limits the combination of high quality borrowers as measured by financial condition and fico score as well as the concentration of firstlien position loans provides a high degree of confidence regarding the performance of the 20092013 originations because we focus on developing complete relationships with our customers many of our home equity borrowers utilize other products and services also the majority of our home equity lineofcredit borrowers consistently pay in excess of the required minimum payment each month  we believe we have underwritten credit conservatively within this portfolio however home price volatility has decreased the value of the collateral for this portfolio and has caused a portion of the portfolio to have an ltv greater than 100 these higher ltv ratios are directly correlated with borrower payment patterns and are a focus of our home saver group    43    table of contents real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended and in the event of default subsequent changes in these values impact the severity of losses we obtain a property valuation for every loan or lineofcredit as part of the origination process and the valuation is reviewed by a real estate professional in conjunction with the credit underwriting process the type of property valuation obtained is based on credit parameters and a majority of these valuations are based on complete walkthrough appraisals we believe an avm estimate with a signed property inspection is an appropriate valuation source for a portion of our home equity lending activities this valuation policy along with our other credit policies are reevaluated on an ongoing basis with the intent of ensuring complete independence in the requesting and reviewing of real estate valuations associated with loan decisions we update values as appropriate and in compliance with applicable regulations particularly for loans identified as higher risk loans are identified as higher risk based on performance indicators and the updated values are utilized to facilitate our portfolio management processes as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions  we continue to make origination policy adjustments based on our assessment of an appropriate risk profile and industry actions in addition to origination policy adjustments we take actions as necessary to manage the risk profile of this portfolio we believe our credit risk management systems allow for effective portfolio analysis and segmentation to identify the highest risk exposures in the portfolio our disclosures regarding lien position and fico distribution are examples of segmentation analysis   although the collateral value assessment is an important component of the overall credit risk analysis there are very few instances of available equity in juniorlien default situations further effective in 2012 any juniorlien loan associated with a nonaccruing firstlien loan is also placed on nonaccrual status  within the home equity lineofcredit portfolio the standard product is a 10year interestonly draw period with a 20year fully amortizing term at the end of the draw period prior to 2007 the standard product was a 10year draw period with a balloon payment while subsequent originations convert to a 20year amortizing loan structure after the 10year draw period the borrower must reapply to extend the existing structure or begin repaying the debt in a traditional term structure  the principal and interest payment associated with the term structure will be higher than the interestonly payment resulting in maturity risk our maturity risk can be segregated into two distinct segments 1 home equity linesofcredit underwritten with a balloon payment at maturity and 2 home equity linesofcredit with an automatic conversion to a 20year amortizing loan we manage this risk based on both the actual maturity date of the lineofcredit structure and at the end of the 10year draw period this maturity risk is embedded in the portfolio which we address with proactive contact strategies beginning one year prior to maturity in certain circumstances our home saver group is able to provide payment and structure relief to borrowers experiencing significant financial hardship associated with the payment adjustment  the table below summarizes our home equity lineofcredit portfolio by maturity date

                    the amounts in the above table maturing in four years or less primarily consist of balloon payment structures and represent the most significant maturity risk the amounts maturing in more than four years primarily consist of exposure with a 20year amortization period after the 10year draw period  historically less than 30 of our home equity linesofcredit that are one year or less from maturity actually reach the maturity date and we anticipate this percentage will decline in future periods as our proactive approach to managing maturity risk continues to evolve  residential mortgages portfolio  we focus on higher quality borrowers and underwrite all applications centrally we do not originate residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options we have incorporated regulatory requirements and guidance into our underwriting process and will continue to evaluate the impact of the qm requirements impact on the industry    44    table of contents all residential mortgages are originated based on a completed full appraisal during the credit underwriting process we update values on a regular basis in compliance with applicable regulations to facilitate our portfolio management as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions  generally our practice is to sell a significant portion of our fixedrate originations in the secondary market as such at december 31 2013 46 of our total residential mortgage portfolio were arms these arms primarily consist of a fixedrate of interest for the first 3 to 5 years and then adjust annually at december 31 2013 arm loans that were expected to have rates reset through 2016 totaled 15 billion these loans scheduled to reset are primarily associated with loans originated subsequent to 2007 and as such are not subject to the most significant declines in underlying property value given the quality of our borrowers the relatively low current interest rates and the results of our continued analysis including possible impacts of changes in interest rates we believe that we have a relatively limited exposure to arm reset risk nonetheless we have taken actions to mitigate our risk exposure we initiate borrower contact at least six months prior to the interest rate resetting and have been successful in converting many arms to fixedrate loans through this process given the relatively low current interest rates many fixedrate products currently offer a better interest rate to our arm borrowers we are subject to repurchase risk associated with residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market an appropriate level of reserve for representations and warranties related to residential mortgage loans sold has been established to address this repurchase risk inherent in the portfolio see operational risk discussion  several government programs continued to impact the residential mortgage portfolio including various refinance programs such as hamp and harp which positively affected the availability of credit for the industry during the year ended december 31 2013 we closed 600 million in harp residential mortgages and 60 million in hamp residential mortgages the harp residential mortgage loans are considered current and are either part of our residential mortgage portfolio or serviced for others the hamp refinancings are associated with residential mortgages that are serviced for others  credit quality  this section should be read in conjunction with note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of credit quality performance ratios this approach forms the basis of most of the discussion in the sections immediately following npas and nals tdrs acl and ncos in addition we utilize delinquency rates risk distribution and migration patterns and product segmentation in the analysis of our credit quality performance  our overall credit quality performance returned to normalized prerecession levels nals declined 21 to 3221 million compared to december 31 2012 as both the campi and cre portfolio segments showed declines ncos decreased 45 compared to the prior year as a result of significant declines in the campi and cre portfolios combined with significant recovery activity and net reductions in the residential and home equity portfolios the home equity portfolio in particular was significantly impacted by the implementation of chapter 7 bankruptcy regulatory accounting guidance with an additional impact in 2013 commercial classified loans declined reflecting the continued improvement across the portfolio the acl to total loans ratio declined to 165 but our coverage ratios as demonstrated by the acl to nal ratio of 221 remained strong  npas nals and tdrs  this section should be read in conjunction with note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial

should be read in conjunction with note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  tdrs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties tdrs can be classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans nonaccrual tdrs are included in nals whereas accruing tdrs are excluded from nals as it is probable that all contractual principal and

concessions subsequent to the initial tdr terms however there are times when subsequent modifications are required such as when the modified loan matures often the loans are performing in accordance with the tdr terms and a new note is originated with similar modified terms these loans are subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing if the loan is not performing in accordance with the existing tdr terms typically an individualized approach to repayment is established in accordance with asc 3102035 the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan a new loan is considered for removal from the tdr designation a continuation of the prior note requires the continuation of the tdr designation and because the refinanced note constitutes a new or amended debt instrument it is included in our tdr activity table below as a new tdr and a restructured tdr removal during the period  the types of concessions granted are consistent with those granted on new tdrs and include interest rate reductions amortization or maturity date changes beyond what the collateral supports and principal forgiveness based on the borrowers specific needs at a point in time our policy does not limit the number of times a loan may be modified a loan may be modified multiple times if it is considered to be in the best interest of both the borrower and us  loans are not automatically considered to be accruing tdrs upon the granting of a new concession if the loan is in accruing status and no loss is expected based on the modified terms the modified tdr remains in accruing status for loans that are on nonaccrual status before the modification collection of both principal and interest must not be in doubt and the borrower must be able to exhibit sufficient cash flows for a sixmonth period of time to service the debt in order to return to accruing status this sixmonth period could extend before or after the restructure date  tdrs in the home equity and residential mortgage portfolio will continue to increase for a time as we continue to appropriately manage the portfolio any granted change in terms or conditions that are not readily available in the market for that borrower requires the designation as a tdr  the following table reflects tdr

components both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the alll and the aulc combined these reserves comprise the total acl our credit administration group is responsible for developing the methodology assumptions and estimates used in the calculation as well as determining the appropriateness of the acl the alll represents the estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reported date additions to the alll result from recording provision expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting from loan riskrating downgrades while reductions reflect chargeoffs net of recoveries decreased risk levels resulting from loan riskrating upgrades or the sale of loans the aulc is determined by applying the transaction reserve process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures multiplied by an applicable funding expectation  a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the acl to the level we have determined to be appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the provision for credit losses in 2013 was 900 million compared with 1474 million in 2012  we regularly evaluate the appropriateness of the acl by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above we also consider the impact of collateral value trends and portfolio diversification  in 2013 we implemented an enhanced commercial risk rating system and acl calculation process in addition we enhanced some of our qualitative assessments specifically around the impact of the prevailing economic conditions these enhancements had an immaterial impact on the overall credit reserve and the overall decline in the acl was primarily due to an improvement in underlying credit quality across the portfolio the portfolio level changes are more fully described below  our acl evaluation process includes the ongoing assessment of credit quality metrics and a comparison of certain acl benchmarks to current performance while the total acl balance has declined in recent quarters all of the relevant benchmarks remain strong  the following table reflects

2012 primarily due to the enhancements to the risk rating system and assumptions regarding the unfunded portion of loan commitments the cre acl decreased 1228 million compared with december 31 2012 due to the impact of incorporating the current collateral value in the calculation of the expected loss in addition to a property type analysis this provides a more specific assessment of the potential loss given default the current portfolio management practices focus on increasing borrower equity in the projects and recent underwriting includes meaningfully lower ltv the december 31 2013 cre acl covers nals by more than two times and represents 13 quarters of the average 4 quarter chargeoff level the decrease associated with the auto portfolio is based on the continued positive performance metrics and the high quality origination strategy the home equity alll increased slightly as the juniorlien lien component remains the riskiest portion of the portfolio the residential mortgage portfolio alll declined consistent with the improving credit quality metrics the alll for the other consumer portfolio is consistent with expectations given the increasing level of overdraft exposure the reduction in the acl compared with december 31 2012 is primarily a function of the decline in the cre portfolio  compared with december 31 2012 the aulc increased 222 million primarily reflecting the impact of an enhanced assessment of the unfunded commercial exposure  the acl to total loans declined to 165 at december 31 2013 compared to 199 at december 31 2012 we believe the decline in the ratio is appropriate given the continued improvement in the risk profile of our loan portfolio further we believe that early identification of loans with changes in credit metrics and aggressive action plans for these loans combined with originating high quality new loans will contribute to continued improvement in our key credit quality metrics  we have significant exposure to loans secured by residential real estate and continue to be an active lender in our communities the impact of the downturn in real estate values over the past several years has had a significant impact on some of our borrowers as evidenced by the higher delinquencies and ncos since late 2007 recently real estate values have begun to slowly rise from their 2007 levels in our primary markets  given the combination of these noted positive and negative factors we believe that our acl is appropriate and its coverage level is reflective of the quality of our portfolio and the current operating environment  ncos  any loan in any portfolio may be chargedoff prior to the policies described below if a loss confirming event has occurred loss confirming events include but are not limited to bankruptcy unsecured continued delinquency foreclosure or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency and that asset is the sole source of repayment additionally discharged collateral dependent nonreaffirmed debt in chapter 7 bankruptcy filings will result in a chargeoff to estimated collateral value less anticipated selling costs at the time of the modification  campi and cre loans are either chargedoff or written down to net realizable value at 90days past due automobile loans and other consumer loans are chargedoff at 120days past due firstlien and juniorlien home equity loans are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs at 150days past due and 120days past due respectively residential mortgages are chargedoff

            in assessing nco trends it is helpful to understand the process of how commercial loans are treated as they deteriorate over time the alll established is consistent with the level of risk associated with the original underwriting as a part of our normal portfolio management process for commercial loans the loan is periodically reviewed and the alll is increased or decreased based on the updated risk rating in certain cases the standard alll is determined to not be appropriate and a specific reserve is established based on the projected cash flow or collateral value of the specific loan chargeoffs if necessary are generally recognized in a period after the specific alll was established if the previously established alll exceeds that necessary to satisfactorily resolve the problem loan a reduction in the overall level of the alll could be recognized consumer loans are treated in much the same manner as commercial loans with increasing reserve factors applied based on the risk characteristics of the loan although specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans in summary if loan quality deteriorates the typical credit sequence would be periods of reserve building followed by periods of higher ncos as the previously established alll is utilized additionally an increase in the alll either precedes or is in conjunction with increases in nals when a loan is classified as nal it is evaluated for specific alll or chargeoff as a result an increase in nals does not necessarily result in an increase in the alll or an expectation of higher future ncos  our overall ncos are returning to prerecession levels however we anticipate nco levels for both the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios will remain at elevated levels in the near future the home equity portfolio will continue to be impacted by borrowers that are seeking to refinance but are in a negative equity position because of the juniorlien loan rightsizing and debt forgiveness associated with these situations are becoming more frequent as borrowers realize the impact to their credit is minor and that a default on a juniorlien loan is not likely to cause borrowers to lose their home  all residential mortgage loans greater than 150days past due are chargeddown to the estimated value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs the remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed or the loan goes through the foreclosure process for the home equity portfolio virtually all of the defaults represent full chargeoffs as there is no remaining equity creating a lower delinquency rate but a higher nco impact  2013 versus 2012  campi ncos decreased 479 million or 74 primarily reflecting credit quality improvement in the underlying portfolio as well as our ongoing proactive credit management practices also 2013 included significant recoveries from prior year chargeoffs  cre ncos decreased 536 million or 68 reflecting both a reduction in loss events and significant recoveries during 2013 this performance is consistent with our expectations for the portfolio as some degree of quarterly volatility is expected given the low absolute levels of ncos in the portfolio there was no concentration in either geography or project type    51    table of contents automobile ncos increased 11 million or 12 the relatively low levels of ncos reflected the continued high credit quality of originations and a strong resale market for used vehicles the slight increasing trend was expected given the absolute low levels achieved in 2012  home equity ncos decreased 341 million or 29 primarily reflecting improved delinquency rates and fewer significant dollar size losses compared to the prior year the impact from the chapter 7 bankruptcy treatment decision inflated the 2012 results with an additional lesser impact in 2013 absent the chapter 7 bankruptcy impact the improvement would have been 15 year over year  residential mortgage ncos declined 208 million or 43 and reflected improvement in the overall housing market compared to the prior year  market risk  market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities we incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads we have identified two primary sources of market risk interest rate risk and price risk  interest rate risk  overview  huntington actively manages interest rate risk as changes in market interest rates can have a significant impact on reported earnings the interest rate risk process is designed to compare income simulations in market scenarios designed to alter the direction magnitude and speed of interest rate changes as well as the slope of the yield curve these scenarios are designed to illustrate the embedded optionality in the balance sheet from among other things faster or slower mortgage prepayments and changes in deposit mix  income simulation and economic value analysis  interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the alco monthly and roc at least quarterly the information reported includes periodend results and identifies any policy limits exceeded along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution mitigation or assumption of the risk  huntington uses two approaches to model interest rate risk interest sensitive earnings at risk ise analysis and economic value of equity eve analysis under ise analysis net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets liabilities and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a oneyear time horizon market implied forward rates and various likely and extreme interest rate scenarios are used for ise analysis these likely and extreme scenarios include rapid and gradual interest rate ramps rate shocks and yield curve twists eve analysis measures the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change  table 20interest sensitive earnings at risk                        net

market interest rates over the next oneyear period beyond the interest rate change implied by the forward yield curve due to the current low level of shortterm interest rates the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of 25 basis points the point at which many assets and liabilities reach zero percent  huntington is within board policy limits for the 100 and 200 basis point scenarios there is no policy limit for the 25 basis point scenario the ise analysis reported at december 31 2013 shows that huntingtons earnings are not significantly sensitive to changes in interest rates due to an increase in the amount of fixed rate assets consisting primarily of indirect auto loans and fixed rate securities the amount of asset sensitivity declined through the year the scenarios above also include the impact of market rate changes on the duration of fixedrate mortgagerelated assets which extend as rates rise and reduce asset sensitivity as interest rates rise the net earnings from our interest rate swaps declines faster under the 200 than 100 basis point scenario resulting in lower asset sensitivity as shown above    52    table of contents table 21economic

rates rise fixed rate assets generally lose economic value the longer the duration the greater the value lost the opposite is true when interest rates fall  compared to recent periods the eve results for december 31 2013 reflect the impact of additional mortgagebacked securities which were added to increase the amount of highly liquid assets in our investment portfolio and higher market rates  msr  this section should be read in conjunction with note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  at december 31 2013 we had a total of 1623 million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service 152 billion in mortgage loans of this 1623 million 342 million was recorded using the fair value method and 1281 million was recorded using the amortization method  msr fair values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be greatly reduced by prepayments prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise we have employed strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment in addition we engage a third party to provide valuation tools and assistance with our strategies with the objective to decrease the volatility from msr fair value changes however volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these hedges we typically report msr fair value adjustments net of hedgerelated trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking income  msrs recorded using the amortization method generally

funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders debt service income taxes operating expenses funding of nonbank subsidiaries repurchases of our stock and acquisitions the parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from interest received from the bank interest and dividends received from direct subsidiaries net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return fees for services provided to subsidiaries and the issuance of debt securities  at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 the parent company had 10 billion and 09 billion respectively in cash and cash equivalents  based on the current quarterly dividend of 005 per common share cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately 415 million per quarter based on the current dividend cash demands required for series a preferred stock are estimated to be approximately 77 million per quarter cash demands required for series b preferred stock are expected to be approximately 03 million per quarter the preferred a and b dividends are payable on april 15 2014 to shareholders of record on april 1 2014  based on a regulatory dividend limitation the bank could not have declared and paid a dividend to the parent company until december 31 2013 without regulatory approval due to the deficit position of its undivided profits we anticipate that the bank will declare dividends to the holding company during the first half of 2014 to help meet any additional liquidity needs we have an openended automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the sec which permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities    58    table of contents with the exception of the items discussed above the parent company does not have any significant cash demands it is our policy to keep operating cash on hand at the parent company to satisfy cash demands for the next 18 months  in august 2013 the parent company issued 4000 million of senior notes at 998 of face value the senior note issuances mature on august 2 2018 and have a fixed coupon rate of 260 the senior note issuances may be redeemed one month prior to the maturity date at 100 of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest  on october 24 2013 the occ us treasury frb and the fdic issued an npr regarding the implementation of a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with the lcr standard established by the basel committee on banking supervision the requirements are designed to promote the short term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks to which it applies comments on the requirement could be submitted until january 31 2014 if implemented as proposed the requirement will likely cause some banks including us to purchase additional amounts of unencumbered high quality liquid assets which can easily be converted into cash  considering the factors discussed above and other analyses that we have performed we believe the parent company has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future  offbalance sheet arrangements  in the normal course of business we enter into various offbalance sheet arrangements these arrangements include financial guarantees contained in standby lettersofcredit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans  standby lettersofcredit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements including commercial paper bond financing and similar transactions most of these arrangements mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon standby lettersofcredit are included in the determination of the amount of riskbased capital that the parent company and the bank are required to hold  through our credit process we monitor the credit risks of outstanding standby lettersofcredit when it is probable that a standby letterofcredit will be drawn and not repaid in full a loss is recognized in the provision for credit losses at december 31 2013 we had 4398 million of standby lettersofcredit outstanding of which 84 were collateralized included in this 4398 million are lettersofcredit issued by the bank that support securities that were issued by our customers and remarketed by the huntington investment company our brokerdealer subsidiary  we enter into forward contracts relating to the mortgage banking business to hedge the exposures we have from commitments to extend new residential mortgage loans to our customers and from our mortgage loans held for sale at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 we had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of 4526 million and 8498 million respectively these contracts mature in less than one year  we do not believe that offbalance sheet arrangements will have a material

operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error inadequate or failed internal systems and controls violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters and security risks we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations and to improve the oversight of our operational risk for example we actively and continuously monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to efraud and loss of sensitive customer data we evaluate internal systems processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any material losses  to mitigate operational risks we have established a senior management operational risk committee and a senior management legal regulatory and compliance committee the responsibilities of these committees among other duties include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns risks or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues both of these committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the risk management committee additionally potential concerns may be escalated to our roc as appropriate  the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies minimize operational and fraud losses and enhance our overall performance  representation and warranty reserve  we primarily conduct our mortgage loan sale and securitization activity with fnma and fhlmc in connection with these and other securitization transactions we make certain representations and warranties that the loans meet certain criteria such as collateral type and underwriting standards we may be required to repurchase individual loans and  or indemnify these organizations against losses due to a loan not meeting the established criteria as part of the consumer portfolio review that was initiated during the 2013 third quarter see consumer credit section for description we continue to evaluate representation and warranty exposure of loans sold with servicing retained associated with borrowers who filed bankruptcy we have a reserve for such losses and exposure which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities the reserves are estimated based on historical and expected repurchase activity average loss rates and current economic trends the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon economic factors investor demand strategies and other external conditions containing a level of uncertainty and risk that may change over the life of the underlying loans we currently do not have sufficient information to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss related to representation and warranty exposure  the tables below reflect activity in the representations and warranties reserve  table 30summary of reserve for representations and warranties on mortgage loans serviced for

major business segments retail and business banking regional and commercial banking automobile finance and commercial real estate and wealth advisors government finance and home lending a treasury  other function also includes our insurance business and other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expenses while this section reviews financial performance from a business segment perspective it should be read in conjunction with the discussion of results of operations note 25 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and other sections for a full understanding of our consolidated financial performance  business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions  revenue sharing  revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations  expense allocation  the management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from treasury  other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury  other expenses except those related to our insurance business reported significant items except for the goodwill impairment and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the four business segments    63    table of contents funds transfer pricing ftp  we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury  other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury  other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilities  net income by business segment  the segregation of net income by business segment for the past three years is presented in the following table  table 34net income by business segment                        year ended december 31     dollar amounts in thousands   2013     2012     2011     retail and business

treasury  other function includes revenue and expense related to our insurance business and assets liabilities and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the four business segments other assets include investment securities and bank owned life insurance the financial impact associated with our ftp methodology as described above is also included  net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios and the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity noninterest income includes insurance income miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments such as bank owned life insurance income and any investment security and trading asset gains or losses noninterest expense includes any insurancerelated expenses as well as certain corporate administrative merger and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments the provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 35 tax rate though our overall effective tax rate is lower as a result treasury  other reflects a credit for income taxes representing the difference between the lower actual effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate used to allocate income taxes to the business segments  the 575 million or 45 year over year increase in net income for treasuryother was primarily the result of the ftp process described above the ftp process produced increased net income for treasuryother as the sustained low market interest rate environment combined with a shift in funding mix to include additional wholesale sources resulted in lower ftp credits paid to the business segments  optimal customer relationship ocr  our ocr initiative is a crossbusiness segment strategy designed to increase overall customer profitability and retention by deepening product and service penetration to consumer and commercial customers we believe this can be accomplished by taking our broad array of services and products and delivering them through a rigorous and disciplined sales management process that is consistent across all business segments and regions it is also supported by robust sales and crossreferral technology  ocr was introduced in late 2009 through 2010 much of the effort was spent on defining processes sales training and systems development to fully capture and measure ocr performance metrics in 2011 we introduced ocrrelated metrics for commercial relationships which complements the previously disclosed consumer ocrrelated metrics in 2013 we continue to experience strong consumer household and commercial relationship growth    64    table of contents consumer ocr performance  for consumer ocr performance there are three key performance metrics 1 the number of checking account households 2 the number of product penetration per consumer checking household and 3 the revenue generated from the consumer households of all business segments  the growth in consumer checking account number of households is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing checking account households the overall objective is to grow the number of households along with an increase in product penetration  we use the checking account since it typically represents the primary banking relationship product we count additional services by type not number of services for example a household that has one checking account and one mortgage we count as having two services a household with four checking accounts we count as having one service the household relationship utilizing four or more services is viewed to be more profitable and loyal the overall objective therefore is to decrease the percentage of 13 services per consumer checking account household while increasing the percentage of those with 4 or more services since we have made significant strides toward having the vast majority of our customers with 4 services during the 2013 second quarter we changed our measurement to 6 services we are holding ourselves to a higher performance standard  the following table presents consumer checking account household ocr

millions    9481      9834                          our emphasis on crosssell coupled with customers increasingly being attracted by the benefits offered through our fair play banking philosophy with programs such as 24hour grace on overdrafts and asteriskfree checking are having a positive effect the percent of consumer households with 6 services at the end of 2013 was 476 up from 472 at the end of last year for 2013 consumer checking account households grew 8 total consumer checking account household revenue in 2013 was 9481 million down 353 million or 4 from 2012 household revenue was negatively impacted by the february 2013 implementation of a new posting order for consumer transactions  commercial ocr performance  for commercial ocr performance there are three key performance metrics 1 the number of commercial relationships 2 the number of services penetration per commercial relationship and 3 the revenue generated commercial relationships include relationships from all business segments  the growth in the number of commercial relationships is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing commercial accounts the overall objective is to grow the number of relationships along with an increase in product service distribution  the commercial relationship is defined as a business banking or commercial banking customer with a checking account relationship we use this metric because we believe that the checking account anchors a business relationship and creates the opportunity to increase our crosssell multiple sales of the same type of service are counted as one service the same as consumer    65    table of contents the following table presents commercial relationship ocr metrics  table 36commercial relationship

loans and leases at december 31 2013 was 165 down from 199 at december 31 2012 we believe the decline in the ratio is appropriate given the continued improvement in the risk profile of our loan portfolio further we believe that early identification of loans with changes in credit metrics and aggressive action plans for these loans combined with originating high quality new loans will contribute to continued improvement in our key credit quality metrics   78    table of contents table 46selected quarterly income statement data1                            2013     dollar amounts in

additional disclosures  forwardlooking statements  this report including mdampa contains certain forwardlooking statements including certain plans expectations goals projections and statements which are subject to numerous assumptions risks and uncertainties statements that do not describe historical or current facts including statements about beliefs and expectations are forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may be identified by words such as expect anticipate believe intend estimate plan target goal or similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will may might should would could or similar variations the forwardlooking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor provided by section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995  while there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the forwardlooking statements 1 worsening of credit quality performance due to a number of factors such as the underlying value of collateral that could prove less valuable than otherwise assumed and assumed cash flows may be worse than expected 2 changes in general economic political or industry conditions uncertainty in us fiscal and monetary policy including the interest rate policies of the federal reserve board volatility and disruptions in global capital and credit markets 3 movements in interest rates 4 competitive pressures on product pricing and services 5 success impact and timing of our business strategies including market acceptance of any new products or services implementing our fair play banking philosophy 6 changes in accounting policies and principles and the accuracy of our assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements 7 extended disruption of vital infrastructure 8 the final outcome of significant litigation 9 the nature extent timing and results of governmental actions examinations reviews reforms regulations and interpretations including those related to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the basel iii regulatory capital reforms as well as those involving the occ federal reserve fdic and cfpb and 10 the outcome of judicial and regulatory decisions regarding practices in the residential mortgage industry including among other things the processes followed for foreclosing residential mortgages    82    table of contents all forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information available at that time we assume no obligation to update forwardlooking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forwardlooking statements were made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by federal securities laws as forwardlooking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance on such statements  nonregulatory capital ratios  in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including         tangible common equity to tangible assets         tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets using basel i and basel iii definitions and         tangible common equity to riskweighted assets using basel i definition  these nonregulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the companys capitalization to other financial services companies these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies these ratios are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap or federal banking regulations as a result these nonregulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company are considered nongaap financial measures  because there are no standardized definitions for these nonregulatory capital ratios the companys calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies also there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors as a result the company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10k in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure basel iii tier 1 common capital ratio estimates are based on managements current interpretation expectations and understanding of the final us basel iii rules adopted by the federal reserve board and released on july 2 2013  risk factors  more information on risk is set forth under the heading risk factors included in item 1a and incorporated by reference into this mdampa additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the risk management and capital discussion as well as the regulatory matters section included in item 1 and incorporated by reference into the mdampa  critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates  our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference into this mdampa describes the significant accounting policies we use in our consolidated financial statements  an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below  allowance for credit losses  our acl of 07 billion at december 31 2013 represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risk associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations    83    table of contents in addition bank regulators periodically review our acl and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan chargeoffs any increase in our acl or loan chargeoffs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  goodwill impairment  goodwill is an intangible asset representing the difference between the purchase price of an asset and its fair market value and is created when a company pays a premium to acquire another company we test goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a twostep process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit goodwill impairment exists when a reporting units carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value goodwill is also tested for impairment on an interim basis using the same twostep process as the annual testing if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount  significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment this judgment includes developing cash flow projections selecting appropriate discount rates identifying relevant market comparables incorporating general economic and market conditions and selecting an appropriate control premium the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value  the first step step 1 of impairment testing requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill to its carrying value to identify potential impairment for our annual impairment testing conducted during 2013 we identified four reporting units with goodwill retail and business banking regional and commercial banking wealth advisors government finance and home lending wgh and insurance auto finance and commercial real estate was not subject to impairment testing as it had no goodwill associated with the unit in addition although insurance is included within treasuryother for business segment reporting it was evaluated as a separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing because it had its own separately allocated goodwill resulting from prior acquisitions and met the reporting unit criteria  for all four reporting units identified in the above paragraph we utilized both income and market approaches to determine the fair value for each reporting unit the income approach was based on discounted cash flows derived from assumptions of balance sheet and income statement activity an internal forecast was developed by considering several longterm key business drivers such as anticipated loan and deposit growth net interest margins and efficiency ratios longterm growth rates were estimated to assist in determining the terminal values the discount rates were estimated based on the capital asset pricing model which considered the riskfree interest rate 20year treasury bonds marketrisk premium equityrisk premium and a companyspecific risk factor the companyspecific risk factor was used to address the uncertainty of growth estimates and earnings projections of management for the market approach revenue earnings and market capitalization multiples of comparable public companies were selected and applied to each reporting units applicable metrics such as book and tangible book values the results of the income and market approaches are combined to arrive at the final calculation of fair value all four of the reporting units tested passed step 1  the second step step 2 of impairment testing is necessary only if the reporting unit does not pass step 1 step 2 compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as none of the reporting units failed step 1 step 2 was not applicable during 2013 testing  due to potential economic uncertainties it is possible that our estimates and assumptions may adversely change in the future if our market capitalization decreases we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing or prior to that time if any changes constitute a triggering event  valuation of financial instruments  assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility assets measured at fair value include mortgage loans held for sale availableforsale and trading securities certain securitized automobile loans derivatives and certain securitization trust notes payable at december 31 2013 approximately 76 billion of our assets and 01 billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value in addition to the above mentioned ongoing fair value measurements fair value is also the unit of measure for recording business combinations and other nonrecurring financial assets and liabilities   at the end of each quarter we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured at fair value as necessary assets or liabilities may be transferred within fair value hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date    84    table of contents where available we use quoted market prices to determine fair value if quoted market prices are not available fair value is determined using either internally developed or independent third party valuation models based on inputs that are either directly observable or derived from market data these inputs include but are not limited to interest rate yield curves option volatilities or option adjusted spreads where neither quoted market prices nor observable market data are available fair value is determined using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on managements expectation that market participants would use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability the determination of appropriate unobservable inputs requires exercise of management judgment a significant portion of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value are measured based on quoted market prices and observable market or independent inputs  the following is a description of the significant estimates used in the valuation of financial assets and liabilities for which quoted market prices and observable market parameters are not available  mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities  our alta private label cmo and pooledtrustpreferred securities portfolios are classified as level 3 and as such use significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the alta and private label cmo securities portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows while the cash flows of our pooledtrustpreferred securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties and are used as a basis for impairment analysis  alta mortgagebacked and privatelabel cmo securities are collateralized by firstlien residential mortgage loans the securities valuation methodology incorporates values obtained from a third party pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and a proprietary pricing model and includes assumptions management believes market participants would use to value the securities under current market conditions the model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds losses recoveries default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures house price depreciation  appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts and discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities with similar collateral structures  pooledtrustpreferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio we engage a third party pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooledtrustpreferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio the pd of each issuer and the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value management evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the third party pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter actual defaults and deferrals in the current period and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with asc 820  derivatives used for hedging purposes  derivatives designated as qualified hedges are tested for hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis assessments are made at the inception of the hedge and on a recurring basis to determine whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item a statistical regression analysis is performed to measure the effectiveness  if based on the assessment a derivative is not expected to be a highly effective hedge or it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge hedge accounting is discontinued as of the quarter the hedge is not highly effective as the statistical regression analysis requires the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are sensitive to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates we consider this a critical accounting estimate  loans held for sale  huntington has elected to apply the fair value option to certain residential mortgage loans that are classified as held for sale at origination the fair value is estimated based on security prices for similar product types  certain consumer and commercial loans are classified as held for sale and are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value the determination of fair value for these consumer loans is based on security prices for similar product types or discounted expected cash flows which takes into consideration factors such as future interest rates prepayment speeds default and loss curves and market discount rates the determination of fair value for commercial loans takes into account factors such as the location and appraised value of the related collateral as well as the estimated cash flows from realization of the collateral    85    table of contents mortgage servicing rights  retained rights to service mortgage loans are recognized as a separate and distinct asset at the time the loans are sold mortgage servicing rights msrs are initially recorded at fair value at the time the related loans are sold and subsequently remeasured at each reporting date under either the fair value or amortization method any increase or decrease in fair value of msrs accounted for under the fair value method as well as any amortization andor impairment of msrs recorded under the amortization method is reflected in earnings in the period that the changes occur msrs are subject to interest rate risk in that their fair value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment fair value is determined based upon the application of an income approach valuation model the valuation model maintained by an independent third party incorporates assumptions in estimating future cash flows these assumptions include time decay payoffs and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions the reasonableness of these pricing models is validated on a minimum of a quarterly basis by at least one independent external service broker valuation because the fair values of msrs are significantly impacted by the use of estimates the use of different assumption estimates can result in different estimated fair values of those msrs  pension valuation  pension plan assets consist of mutual funds corporate bonds us government bonds our common stock and other investment assets investments are accounted for at cost on the trade date and are reported at fair value mutual funds are valued at quoted net asset value our common stock is traded on a national securities exchange and is valued at the last reported sales price  the discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to determine the benefit obligation and pension expense are both significant assumptions actual results may be materially different see note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  contingent liabilities  we are parties to various claims litigation and legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current andor former operations we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a casebycase basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering among other factors the progress of each case or proceeding our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings and the opinions and views of legal counsel litigation exposure represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our control  income taxes  the calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments we have two accruals for income taxes 1 our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal state and local taxing jurisdictions net of any reserve for potential audit issues and any tax refunds and the net receivable balance is reported as a component of accrued income and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 2 our deferred federal and state income tax and related valuation accounts reported as a component of accrued income and other assets represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under gaap and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under federal and state tax law  in the ordinary course of business we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes the effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws we believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements we review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions in addition we rely on various tax opinions recent tax audits and historical experience  from timetotime we engage in business transactions that may affect our tax liabilities where appropriate we have obtained opinions of outside experts and have assessed the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking into account statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position however changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates implementation of new business strategies resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance such changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position and  or results of operations see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements    86    table of contents deferred tax assets  at december 31 2013 we had a net federal deferred tax asset of 979 million and a net state deferred tax asset of 397 million a valuation allowance is provided when it is morelikelythannot that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized all available evidence both positive and negative was considered to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence impairment should be recognized our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change if our forecast of taxable income within the carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets such assets may be impaired based on our analysis of both positive and negative evidence and our ability to offset the net deferred tax assets against our forecasted future taxable income there was no impairment of the net deferred tax assets at december 31 2013 for regulatory capital purposes  recent accounting pronouncements and developments  note 2 to consolidated financial

significant accounting policies  nature of operations  huntington bancshares incorporated huntington or the company is a multistate diversified regional bank holding company organized under maryland law in 1966 and headquartered in columbus ohio through its subsidiaries including its bank subsidiary the huntington national bank the bank huntington is engaged in providing fullservice commercial small business consumer banking services mortgage banking services automobile financing equipment leasing investment management trust services brokerage services customized insurance programs and other financial products and services huntingtons banking offices are located in ohio michigan pennsylvania indiana west virginia and kentucky select financial services and other activities are also conducted in various other states international banking services are available through the headquarters office in columbus ohio and a limited purpose office located in the cayman islands and another in hong kong  basis of presentation  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of huntington and its majorityowned subsidiaries and are presented in accordance with gaap all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation companies in which huntington holds more than a 50 voting equity interest or a controlling financial interest or are a vie in which huntington has the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie which could potentially be significant to the vie are consolidated vies are legal entities with insubstantial equity whose equity investors lack the ability to make decisions about the entitys activities or whose equity investors do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity if they occur vies in which huntington does not hold the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance or does not have an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie which could potentially be significant to the vie are not consolidated for consolidated entities where huntington holds less than a 100 interest huntington recognizes noncontrolling interest included in shareholders equity for the equity held by others and noncontrolling profit or loss included in noninterest expense for the portion of the entitys earnings attributable to others interests investments in companies that are not consolidated are accounted for using the equity method when huntington has the ability to exert significant influence those investments in nonmarketable securities for which huntington does not have the ability to exert significant influence are generally accounted for using the cost method investments in private investment partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method or the cost method are included in accrued income and other assets and huntingtons proportional interest in the equity investments earnings are included in other noninterest income investment interests accounted for under the cost and equity methods are periodically evaluated for impairment  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that significantly affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements huntington utilizes processes that involve the use of significant estimates and the judgments of management in determining the amount of its allowance for credit losses income taxes deferred tax assets and contingent liabilities as well as fair value measurements of investment securities derivatives goodwill pension assets and liabilities mortgage servicing rights and loans held for sale as with any estimate actual results could differ from those estimates  certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation  resale and repurchase agreements  securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest the fair value of collateral either received from or provided to a third party is continually monitored and additional collateral is obtained or requested to be returned to huntington in accordance with the agreement  securities  securities purchased with the intention of recognizing shortterm profits or which are actively bought and sold are classified as trading account securities and reported at fair value the unrealized gains or losses on trading account securities are recorded in other noninterest income except for gains and losses on trading account securities used to hedge the fair value of msrs which are included in mortgage banking income debt securities purchased in which huntington has the positive intent and ability to hold to its maturity are classified as heldtomaturity securities heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost all other debt and equity securities are classified as availableforsale and other securities unrealized gains or losses on availableforsale and other securities are reported as a separate component of accumulated oci in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders equity creditrelated declines in the value of debt and marketable equity securities that are considered otherthantemporary are recorded in noninterest income  huntington evaluates its investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis for indicators of otti huntington assesses whether otti has occurred when the fair value of a debt security is less than the amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date management reviews the amount of unrealized loss the length of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position the credit rating history market trends of similar security classes time remaining to maturity and the source of both interest and principal payments to identify    99    table of contents  securities which could potentially be impaired otti is considered to have occurred 1 if huntington intends to sell the security 2 if it is more likely than not huntington will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 the present value of expected cash flows are not sufficient to recover all contractually required principal and interest payments for securities that huntington does not expect to sell or it is not more likely than not to be required to sell the otti is separated into credit and noncredit components a discounted cash flow analysis which includes evaluating the timing of the expected cash flows is completed for all debt securities subject to credit impairment the measurement of the credit loss component is equal to the difference between the debt securitys cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows discounted at the securitys effective yield the creditrelated otti represented by the expected loss in principal is recognized in noninterest income the remaining difference between the securitys fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not creditrelated and therefore are recognized in oci huntington believes that it will fully collect the carrying value of securities on which noncreditrelated otti has been recognized in oci noncreditrelated otti results from other factors including increased liquidity spreads and extension of the security for securities which huntington does expect to sell or if it is more likely than not huntington will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis all otti is recognized in earnings presentation of otti is made in the consolidated statements of income on a gross basis with a reduction for the amount of otti recognized in oci once an otti is recorded when future cash flows can be reasonably estimated future cash flows are reallocated between interest and principal cash flows to provide for a levelyield on the security  securities transactions are recognized on the trade date the date the order to buy or sell is executed the carrying value plus any related oci balance of sold securities is used to compute realized gains and losses interest and dividends on securities including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the effective interest method over the period to maturity are included in interest income  nonmarketable equity securities include stock acquired for regulatory purposes such as federal home loan bank stock and federal reserve bank stock these securities are accounted for at cost evaluated for impairment and included in availableforsale and other securities  loans and leases  loans and direct financing leases for which huntington has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as loans and leases except for loans which are subject to fair value requirements loans and leases are carried at the principal amount outstanding net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs and net of unearned income direct financing leases are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values net of unearned and deferred income interest income is accrued as earned using the interest method based on unpaid principal balances huntington defers the fees it receives from the origination of loans and leases as well as the direct costs of those activities huntington also acquires loans at a premium and at a discount to their contractual values huntington amortizes loan discounts premiums and net loan origination fees and costs on a levelyield basis over the estimated lives of the related loans  troubled debt restructurings are loans for which the original contractual terms have been modified to provide a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties loan modifications are considered tdrs when the concessions provided are not available to the borrower through either normal channels or other sources however not all loan modifications are tdrs modifications resulting in troubled debt restructurings may include changes to one or more terms of the loan including but not limited to a change in interest rate an extension of the amortization period a reduction in payment amount and partial forgiveness or deferment of principal or accrued interest  residual values on leased equipment are evaluated quarterly for impairment impairment of the residual values of direct financing leases determined to be other than temporary is recognized by writing the leases down to fair value with a charge to other noninterest expense residual value losses arise if the expected fair value at the end of the lease term is less than the residual value recorded at the lease origination net of estimated amounts reimbursable by the lessee future declines in the expected residual value of the leased equipment would result in expected losses of the leased equipment  for leased equipment the residual component of a direct financing lease represents the estimated fair value of the leased equipment at the end of the lease term huntington uses industry data historical experience and independent appraisals to establish these residual value estimates additional information regarding product life cycle product upgrades as well as insight into competing products are obtained through relationships with industry contacts and are factored into residual value estimates where applicable  loans held for sale  loans and loan commitments in which huntington does not have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as loans held for sale loans held for sale excluding loans originated or acquired with the intent to sell which are carried at fair value are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell the fair value option is generally elected for mortgage loans held for sale to facilitate hedging of the loans fair value is determined based on collateral value and prevailing market prices for loans with similar characteristics nonmortgage loans held for sale are measured on an aggregate asset basis    100    table of contents allowance for credit losses  huntington maintains two reserves both of which reflect managements judgment regarding the appropriate level necessary to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the alll and the aulc combined these reserves comprise the total acl the determination of the acl requires significant estimates including the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and leases consideration of current economic conditions and historical loss experience pertaining to pools of homogeneous loans and leases all of which may be susceptible to change  the appropriateness of the acl is based on managements current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio these judgments consider ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support further management evaluates the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above additional factors also considered include the impact of increasing or decreasing residential real estate values the diversification of cre loans the development of new or expanded commercial business segments such as healthcare abl and energy and the overall condition of the manufacturing industry also the acl assessment includes the ongoing assessment of credit quality metrics and a comparison of certain acl benchmarks to current performance managements determinations regarding the appropriateness of the acl are reviewed and approved by the companys board of directors  the alll consists of two components 1 the transaction reserve which includes a loan level allocation specific reserves related to loans considered to be impaired and loans involved in troubled debt restructurings and 2 the general reserve the transaction reserve component includes both 1 an estimate of loss based on pools of commercial and consumer loans and leases with similar characteristics and 2 an estimate of loss based on an impairment review of each impaired campi and cre loan greater than 10 million for the campi and cre portfolios the estimate of loss based on pools of loans and leases with similar characteristics is made by applying a pd factor and a lgd factor to each individual loan based on a regularly updated loan grade using a standardized loan grading system the pd factor and an lgd factor are determined for each loan grade using statistical models based on historical performance data the pd factor considers ongoing reviews of the financial performance of the specific borrower including cash flow debtservice coverage ratio earnings power debt level and equity position in conjunction with an assessment of the borrowers industry and future prospects the lgd factor considers analysis of the type of collateral and the relative ltv ratio these reserve factors are developed based on credit migration models that track historical movements of loans between loan ratings over time and a combination of longterm average loss experience of our own portfolio and external industry data using a 24month emergence period  in the case of more homogeneous portfolios such as automobile loans home equity loans and residential mortgage loans the determination of the transaction reserve also incorporates pd and lgd factors the estimate of loss is based on pools of loans and leases with similar characteristics the pd factor considers current credit scores unless the account is delinquent in which case a higher pd factor is used the credit score provides a basis for understanding the borrowers past and current payment performance and this information is used to estimate expected losses over the 12month emergence period the performance of firstlien loans ahead of our juniorlien loans is available to use as part of our updated score process the lgd factor considers analysis of the type of collateral and the relative ltv ratio credit scores models analyses and other factors used to determine both the pd and lgd factors are updated frequently to capture the recent behavioral characteristics of the subject portfolios as well as any changes in loss mitigation or credit origination strategies and adjustments to the reserve factors are made as required models utilized in the alll estimation process are subject to the companys model validation policies  the general reserve consists of the economic reserve and riskprofile reserve components the economic reserve component considers the impact of changing market and economic conditions on portfolio performance the riskprofile component considers items unique to our structure policies processes and portfolio composition as well as qualitative measurements and assessments of the loan portfolios including but not limited to management quality concentrations portfolio composition industry comparisons and internal review functions  during the year we made enhancements to our commercial risk rating system used for assessing credit risk when determining our acl the enhancements provide greater granularity in overall corporate risk ratings and incorporate a broader set of financial metrics in the determination of the pd and lgd the pd and lgd factors combine to represent the transaction reserve component for a given credit exposure  the estimate for the aulc is determined using the same procedures and methodologies as used for the alll the loss factors used in the aulc are the same as the loss factors used in the alll while also considering a historical utilization of unused commitments the aulc is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets  nonaccrual and past due loans  loans are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due date    101    table of contents any loan in any portfolio may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to the policies described below when collection of principal or interest is in doubt when a borrower with debt is discharged in a chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower the loan is determined to be collateral dependent and placed on nonaccrual status unless there is a coborrower  all classes within the campi and cre portfolios except for purchased creditimpaired loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 90days past due firstlien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 150days past due juniorlien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of 120days past due or when the related firstlien loan has been identified as nonaccrual automobile and other consumer loans are generally chargedoff when the loan is 120days past due residential mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 150days past due with the exception of residential mortgages guaranteed by government agencies which continue to accrue interest at the rate guaranteed by the government agency we are reimbursed from the government agency for reasonable expenses incurred in servicing loans the fha reimburses us for 66 of expenses and the va reimburses us at a maximum percentage of guarantee which is established for each individual loan we have not experienced either material losses in excess of guarantee caps or significant delays or rejected claims from the related government entity  for all classes within all loan portfolios when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status any accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to interest income and prior year amounts chargedoff as a credit loss  for all classes within all loan portfolios cash receipts received on nals are applied against principal until the loan or lease has been collected in full after which time any additional cash receipts are recognized as interest income however for secured nonreaffirmed debt in a chapter 7 bankruptcy payments are applied to principal and interest when the borrower has demonstrated a capacity to continue payment of the debt and collection of the debt is reasonably assured for unsecured nonreaffirmed debt in a chapter 7 bankruptcy where the carrying value has been fully chargedoff payments are recorded as loan recoveries  regarding all classes within the campi and cre portfolios the determination of a borrowers ability to make the required principal and interest payments is based on an examination of the borrowers current financial statements industry management capabilities and other qualitative measures for all classes within the consumer loan portfolio the determination of a borrowers ability to make the required principal and interest payments is based on multiple factors including number of days past due and in some instances an evaluation of the borrowers financial condition when in managements judgment the borrowers ability to make required principal and interest payments resumes and collectability is no longer in doubt the loan is returned to accrual status for these loans that have been returned to accrual status cash receipts are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan  chargeoff of uncollectible loans  any loan in any portfolio may be chargedoff prior to the policies described below if a loss confirming event has occurred loss confirming events include but are not limited to bankruptcy unsecured continued delinquency foreclosure or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency and that asset is the sole source of repayment additionally discharged collateral dependent nonreaffirmed debt in chapter 7 bankruptcy filings will result in a chargeoff to estimated collateral value less anticipated selling costs  campi and cre loans are either chargedoff or written down to net realizable value at 90days past due automobile loans and other consumer loans are chargedoff at 120days past due firstlien and juniorlien home equity loans are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs at 150days past due and 120days past due respectively residential mortgages are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the collateral at 150days past due  impaired loans  for all classes within the campi and cre portfolios all loans with an outstanding balance of 10 million or greater are evaluated on a quarterly basis for impairment generally consumer loans within any class are not individually evaluated on a regular basis for impairment all tdrs regardless of the outstanding balance amount are also considered to be impaired loans acquired with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable at acquisition that all contractually required payments will not be collected are also considered to be impaired  once a loan has been identified for an assessment of impairment the loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected this determination requires significant judgment and use of estimates and the eventual outcome may differ significantly from those estimates  when a loan in any class has been determined to be impaired the amount of the impairment is measured using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or as a practical expedient the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent when the present value of expected future cash flows is used the effective interest rate is the original contractual interest rate of the loan adjusted for any premium or discount when the contractual interest rate is variable the effective interest rate of the loan changes over time a specific reserve is established as a component of the alll when a loan has been determined to be impaired subsequent to the initial measurement of impairment if there is a significant change to the impaired loans expected future cash flows or if actual cash flows are significantly different from the cash flows previously estimated huntington recalculates the impairment and appropriately adjusts the specific reserve similarly if huntington measures impairment based on the observable market price of an impaired loan or the fair value of the collateral of an impaired collateral dependent loan huntington will adjust the specific reserve    102    table of contents when a loan within any class is impaired the accrual of interest income is discontinued unless the receipt of principal and interest is no longer in doubt interest income on tdrs is accrued when all principal and interest is expected to be collected under the postmodification terms cash receipts received on nonaccruing impaired loans within any class are generally applied entirely against principal until the loan has been collected in full after which time any additional cash receipts are recognized as interest income cash receipts received on accruing impaired loans within any class are applied in the same manner as accruing loans that are not considered impaired  purchased creditimpaired loans  purchased loans with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable at acquisition that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are considered to be credit impaired purchased creditimpaired loans are initially recorded at fair value which is estimated by discounting the cash flows expected to be collected at the acquisition date because the estimate of expected cash flows reflects an estimate of future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loans an allowance for credit losses is not recorded at the acquisition date the excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value referred to as the accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans on a levelyield basis the difference between the contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference a subsequent decrease in the estimate of cash flows expected to be received on purchased creditimpaired loans generally results in the recognition of an allowance for credit losses subsequent increases in cash flows result in reversal of any nonaccretable difference or allowance for loan and lease losses to the extent any has been recorded with a positive impact on interest income subsequently recognized the measurement of cash flows involves assumptions and judgments for interest rates prepayments default rates loss severity and collateral values all of these factors are inherently subjective and significant changes in the cash flow estimates over the life of the loan can result  transfers of financial assets and securitizations  transfers of financial assets in which we have surrendered control over the transferred assets are accounted for as sales in assessing whether control has been surrendered we consider whether the transferee would be a consolidated affiliate the existence and extent of any continuing involvement in the transferred financial assets and the impact of all arrangements or agreements made contemporaneously with or in contemplation of the transfer even if they were not entered into at the time of transfer control is generally considered to have been surrendered when i the transferred assets have been legally isolated from us or any of our consolidated affiliates even in bankruptcy or other receivership ii the transferee or if the transferee is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization or assetbacked financing that is constrained from pledging or exchanging the assets it receives each thirdparty holder of its beneficial interests has the right to pledge or exchange the assets or beneficial interests it received without any constraints that provide more than a trivial benefit to us and iii neither we nor our consolidated affiliates and agents have a both the right and obligation under any agreement to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets before their maturity b the unilateral ability to cause the holder to return specific financial assets that also provides us with a morethantrivial benefit other than through a cleanup call or c an agreement that permits the transferee to require us to repurchase the transferred assets at a price so favorable that it is probable that it will require us to repurchase them  if the sale criteria are met the transferred financial assets are removed from our balance sheet and a gain or loss on sale is recognized if the sale criteria are not met the transfer is recorded as a secured borrowing in which the assets remain on our balance sheet and the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a liability for the majority of financial asset transfers it is clear whether or not we have surrendered control for other transfers such as in connection with complex transactions or where we have continuing involvement we generally obtain a legal opinion as to whether the transfer results in a true sale by law  we have historically securitized certain automobile receivables gains and losses on the loans and leases sold and servicing rights associated with loan and lease sales are determined when the related loans or leases are sold to either a securitization trust or third party for loan or lease sales with servicing retained a servicing asset is recorded at fair value for the right to service the loans sold  derivative financial instruments  a variety of derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps caps floors and collars are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements these instruments provide flexibility in adjusting huntingtons sensitivity to changes in interest rates without exposure to loss of principal and higher funding requirements  huntington also uses derivatives principally loan sale commitments in hedging its mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and its mortgage loans held for sale mortgage loan sale commitments and the related interest rate lock commitments are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking income huntington also uses certain derivative financial instruments to offset changes in value of its msrs these derivatives consist primarily of forward interest rate agreements and forward mortgage contracts the derivative instruments used are not designated as hedges accordingly such derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking income    103    table of contents derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities respectively and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into we designate it as either            a qualifying hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge            a qualifying hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset liability or forecasted transaction cash flow hedge or            a trading instrument or a nonqualifying economic hedge  changes in the fair value of a derivative that has been designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period earnings changes in the fair value of a derivative that has been designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge to the extent effective as a hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of income taxes and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged item affects earnings ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship is reflected in current period earnings changes in the fair value of derivatives held for trading purposes or which do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in current period earnings  for those derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied huntington formally documents the hedging relationship and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge this documentation identifies the hedging instrument the hedged item or transaction the nature of the risk being hedged and unless the hedge meets all of the criteria to assume there is no ineffectiveness the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging instrument and how ineffectiveness will be measured the methods utilized to assess retrospective hedge effectiveness as well as the frequency of testing vary based on the type of item being hedged and the designated hedge period for specifically designated fair value hedges of certain fixedrate debt huntington utilizes the shortcut method when certain criteria are met for other fair value hedges of fixedrate debt including certificates of deposit huntington utilizes the regression method to evaluate hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis for fair value hedges of portfolio loans the regression method is used to evaluate effectiveness on a daily basis for cash flow hedges the regression method is applied on a quarterly basis  hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when            the derivative is no longer effective or expected to be effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item including firm commitments or forecasted transactions            the derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercised            it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur            the hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment or            the designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is removed  when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value or cash flow hedge the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value  in the case of a discontinued fair value hedge of a recognized asset or liability as long as the hedged item continues to exist on the balance sheet the hedged item will no longer be adjusted for changes in fair value the basis adjustment that had previously been recorded to the hedged item during the period from the hedge designation date to the hedge discontinuation date is recognized as an adjustment to the yield of the hedged item over the remaining life of the hedged item  in the case of a discontinued cash flow hedge of a recognized asset or liability as long as the hedged item continues to exist on the balance sheet the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the hedging derivative will no longer be recorded to other comprehensive income the balance applicable to the discontinued hedging relationship will be recognized in earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item as an adjustment to yield if the discontinued hedged item was a forecasted transaction that is not expected to occur any amounts recorded on the balance sheet related to the hedged item including any amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified to current period earnings  in the case of either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge if the previously hedged item is sold or extinguished the basis adjustment to the underlying asset or liability or any remaining unamortized other comprehensive income balance will be reclassified to current period earnings    104    table of contents in all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued the derivative will be carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings unless redesignated as a qualifying hedge  like other financial instruments derivatives contain an element of credit risk which is the possibility that huntington will incur a loss because the counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations notional values of interest rate swaps and other offbalance sheet financial instruments significantly exceed the credit risk associated with these instruments and represent contractual balances on which calculations of amounts to be exchanged are based credit exposure is limited to the sum of the aggregate fair value of positions that have become favorable to huntington including any accrued interest receivable due from counterparties potential credit losses are mitigated through careful evaluation of counterparty credit standing selection of counterparties from a limited group of high quality institutions collateral agreements and other contract provisions huntington considers the value of collateral held and collateral provided in determining the net carrying value of derivatives  huntington offsets the fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and the fair value for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement  repossessed collateral  repossessed collateral also referred to as other real estate owned oreo is comprised principally of commercial and residential real estate properties obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations and is carried at the lower of cost or fair value collateral obtained in satisfaction of a loan is recorded at the estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs based upon the propertys appraised value at the date of foreclosure with any difference between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of the loan recorded as a chargeoff subsequent declines in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are recorded in noninterest expense gains or losses resulting from the sale of collateral are recognized in noninterest expense at the date of sale  collateral  we pledge assets as collateral as required for various transactions including security repurchase agreements public deposits loan notes derivative financial instruments shortterm borrowings and longterm borrowings assets that have been pledged as collateral including those that can be sold or repledged by the secured party continue to be reported on our consolidated balance sheets  we also accept collateral primarily as part of various transactions including derivative and security resale agreements collateral accepted by us including collateral that we can sell or repledge is excluded from our consolidated balance sheets  the market value of collateral we have accepted or pledged is regularly monitored and additional collateral is obtained or provided as necessary to ensure appropriate collateral coverage in these transactions  premises and equipment  premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is computed principally by the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets buildings and building improvements are depreciated over an average of 30 to 40 years and 10 to 30 years respectively land improvements and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over an average of 5 to 20 years while equipment is depreciated over a range of 3 to 10 years leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the assets useful life or the lease term including any renewal periods for which renewal is reasonably assured maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred while improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life premises and equipment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  mortgage servicing rights  huntington recognizes the rights to service mortgage loans as separate assets which are included in accrued income and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets when purchased or when servicing is contractually separated from the underlying mortgage loans by sale or securitization of the loans with servicing rights retained  for loan sales with servicing retained a servicing asset is recorded at fair value for the right to service the loans sold to determine the fair value of a msr huntington uses an option adjusted spread cash flow analysis incorporating market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and market interest rates the forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for us dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments the current and projected mortgage interest rate influences the prepayment rate and therefore the timing and magnitude of the cash flows associated with the msr expected mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are derived from a third party model management believes these prepayment assumptions are consistent with assumptions used by other market participants valuing similar msrs servicing revenues on mortgage loans are included in mortgage banking income  at the time of initial capitalization msrs may be grouped into servicing classes based on the availability of market inputs used in determining fair value and the method used for managing the risks of the servicing assets msr assets are recorded using the fair value method or the amortization method the election of the fair value or amortization method is made at the time each servicing    105    table of contents  class is established all newly created msrs since 2009 were recorded using the amortization method any change in the fair value of msrs carried under the fair value method as well as amortization and impairment of msrs under the amortization method during the period is recorded in mortgage banking income which is reflected in the consolidated statements of income huntington hedges the value of certain msrs using derivative instruments and trading securities changes in fair value of these derivatives and trading account securities are reported as a component of mortgage banking income  goodwill and other intangible assets  under the acquisition method of accounting the net assets of entities acquired by huntington are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition the excess cost of the acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill other intangible assets are amortized either on an accelerated or straightline basis over their estimated useful lives goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis at october 1st of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  pension and other postretirement benefits  we recognize the funded status of the postretirement benefit plans on the consolidated balance sheets net postretirement benefit cost charged to current earnings related to these plans is based on various actuarial assumptions regarding expected future experience  certain employees are participants in various defined contribution and other nonqualified supplemental retirement plans our contributions to these plans are charged to current earnings  in addition we maintain a 401k plan covering substantially all employees employer contributions to the plan which are charged to current earnings are based on employee contributions  sharebased compensation  we use the fair value based method of accounting for awards of hban stock granted to employees under various stock option and restricted share plans stock compensation costs are recognized prospectively for all new awards granted under these plans compensation expense relating to share options is calculated using a methodology that is based on the underlying assumptions of the blackscholes option pricing model and is charged to expense over the requisite service period eg vesting period compensation expense relating to restricted stock awards is based upon the fair value of the awards on the date of grant and is charged to earnings over the requisite service period eg vesting period of the award  stock repurchases  acquisitions of huntington stock are recorded at cost the reissuance of shares is recorded at weightedaverage cost  income taxes  income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method accordingly deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future book and tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income at the time of enactment of such change in tax rates any interest or penalties due for payment of income taxes are included in the provision for income taxes to the extent that we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is recorded all positive and negative evidence is reviewed when determining how much of a valuation allowance is recognized on a quarterly basis in determining the requirements for a valuation allowance sources of possible taxable income are evaluated including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards taxable income in appropriate carryback years and taxplanning strategies huntington applies a more likely than not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties  bank owned life insurance  huntingtons bank owned life insurance policies are recorded at their cash surrender value huntington recognizes taxexempt income from the periodic increases in the cash surrender value of these policies and from death benefits a portion of the cash surrender value is supported by holdings in separate accounts book value protection for the separate accounts is provided by the insurance carriers and a highly rated major bank  fair value measurements  the company records or discloses certain of its assets and liabilities at fair value fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date fair value measurements are classified within one of three levels in a valuation hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date the three levels are defined as follows  level 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets  level 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument    106    table of contents level 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement  a financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement  segment results  accounting policies for the business segments are the same as those used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements with respect to activities specifically attributable to each business segment however the preparation of business segment results requires management to establish methodologies to allocate funding costs and benefits expenses and other financial elements to each business segment changes are made in these methodologies as appropriate  statement of cash flows  cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and due from banks which includes amounts on deposit with the federal reserve and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements  transactions with related parties  in the normal course of business we may enter into transactions with various related parties these transactions occur at prevailing market rates and terms and include funding arrangements transfers of financial assets administrative and operational support and other miscellaneous services  2 accounting standards update  asu 201104  fair value measurement topic 820 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and

cre loans and for purposes of determining an appropriate acl level for these loans huntington utilizes the following categories of credit grades  pass  higher quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories described below  olem  the credit risk may be relatively minor yet represent a risk given certain specific circumstances if the potential weaknesses are not monitored or mitigated the loan may weaken or the collateral may be inadequate to protect huntingtons position in the future for these reasons huntington considers the loans to be potential problem loans  substandard  inadequately protected loans by the borrowers ability to repay equity andor the collateral pledged to secure the loan these loans have identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt it is likely huntington will sustain some loss if any identified weaknesses are not mitigated  doubtful  loans that have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as substandard with the added elements of the full collection of the loan is improbable and that the possibility of loss is high  the categories above which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions are assigned upon initial approval of the loan or lease and subsequently updated as appropriate  commercial loans categorized as olem substandard or doubtful are considered criticized loans commercial loans categorized as substandard or doubtful are also considered classified loans  for all classes within all consumer loan portfolios each loan is assigned a specific pd factor that is partially based on the borrowers most recent credit bureau score fico which we update quarterly a fico credit bureau score is a credit score developed by fair isaac corporation based on data provided by the credit bureaus the fico credit bureau score is widely accepted as the standard measure of consumer credit risk used by lenders regulators rating agencies and consumers the higher the fico credit bureau score the higher likelihood of repayment and therefore an indicator of higher credit quality  huntington assesses the risk in the loan portfolio by utilizing numerous risk characteristics the classifications described above and also presented in the table below represent one of those characteristics that are closely monitored in the overall credit risk management processes the table below also shows an increase in fico scores less than 650 for the automobile portfolio this increase is proportional to growth in the portfolio and does not reflect a deterioration in asset quality for the portfolio as other risk characteristics mitigate any increased level of risk associated with the fico score distribution    114    table of contents the following table

loans  tdrs are modified loans where a concession was provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties loan modifications are considered tdrs when the concessions provided are not available to the borrower through either normal channels or other sources however not all loan modifications are tdrs  the amount of interest that would have been recorded under the original terms for total accruing tdr loans was 439 million 412 million and 377 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the total amount of interest recorded to interest income for these loans was 357 million 322 million and 282 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively  tdr concession types  the companys standards relating to loan modifications consider among other factors minimum verified income requirements cash flow analysis and collateral valuations each potential loan modification is reviewed individually and the terms of the loan are modified to meet a borrowers specific circumstances at a point in time all commercial tdrs are reviewed and approved by our sad the types of concessions provided to borrowers include            interest rate reduction a reduction of the stated interest rate to a nonmarket rate for the remaining original life of the debt            amortization or maturity date change beyond what the collateral supports including any of the following        1 lengthens the amortization period of the amortized principal beyond market terms this concession reduces the minimum monthly payment and increases the amount of the balloon payment at the end of the term of the loan principal is generally not forgiven    120    table of contents     2 reduces the amount of loan principal to be amortized and increases the amount of the balloon payment at the end of the term of the loan this concession also reduces the minimum monthly payment principal is generally not forgiven        3 extends the maturity date or dates of the debt beyond what the collateral supports this concession generally applies to loans without a balloon payment at the end of the term of the loan            chapter 7 bankruptcy a bankruptcy courts discharge of a borrowers debt is considered a concession when the borrower does not reaffirm the discharged debt            other a concession that is not categorized as one of the concessions described above these concessions include but are not limited to principal forgiveness collateral concessions covenant concessions and reduction of accrued interest principal forgiveness may result from any tdr modification of any concession type however the aggregate amount of principal forgiven as a result of loans modified as tdrs during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 was not significant  following is a description of tdrs by the different loan types  commercial loan tdrs  commercial accruing tdrs often result from loans receiving a concession with terms that are not considered a market transaction to huntington the tdr remains in accruing status as long as the customer is less than 90days past due on payments per the restructured loan terms and no loss is expected  commercial nonaccrual tdrs result from either 1 an accruing commercial tdr being placed on nonaccrual status or 2 a workout where an existing commercial nal is restructured and a concession was given at times these workouts restructure the nal so that two or more new notes are created the primary note is underwritten based upon our normal underwriting standards and is sized so projected cash flows are sufficient to repay contractual principal and interest the terms on the secondary notes vary by situation and may include notes that defer principal and interest payments until after the primary note is repaid creating two or more notes often allows the borrower to continue a project or weather a temporary economic downturn and allows huntington to rightsize a loan based upon the current expectations for a borrowers or projects performance  our strategy involving tdr borrowers includes working with these borrowers to allow them to refinance elsewhere as well as allow them time to improve their financial position and remain our customer through refinancing their notes according to market terms and conditions in the future a subsequent refinancing or modification of a loan may occur when either the loan matures according to the terms of the tdrmodified agreement or the borrower requests a change to the loan agreements at that time the loan is evaluated to determine if it is creditworthy it is subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan a new loan is considered for removal of the tdr designation whereas a continuation of the prior note requires a continuation of the tdr designation in order for a tdr designation to be removed the borrower must no longer be experiencing financial difficulties and the terms of the refinanced loan must not represent a concession residential mortgage loan tdrs  residential mortgage tdrs represent loan modifications associated with traditional firstlien mortgage loans in which a concession has been provided to the borrower the primary concessions given to residential mortgage borrowers are amortization or maturity date changes and interest rate reductions residential mortgages identified as tdrs involve borrowers unable to refinance their mortgages through the companys normal mortgage origination channels or through other independent sources some but not all of the loans may be delinquent  automobile home equity and other consumer loan tdrs  the company may make similar interest rate term and principal concessions as with residential mortgage loan tdrs  tdr impact on credit quality  huntingtons alll is largely determined by updated risk ratings assigned to commercial loans updated borrower credit scores on consumer loans and borrower delinquency history in both the commercial and consumer portfolios these updated risk ratings and credit scores consider the default history of the borrower including payment redefaults as such the provision for credit losses is impacted primarily by changes in borrower payment performance rather than the tdr classification tdrs can be classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans nonaccrual tdrs are included in nals whereas accruing tdrs are excluded from nals as it is probable that all contractual principal and interest due under the restructured terms will be collected  our tdrs may include multiple concessions and the disclosure classifications are presented based on the primary concession provided to the borrower the majority of our concessions for the campi and cre portfolios are the extension of the maturity date coupled with an increase in the interest rate in these instances the primary concession is the maturity date extension    121    table of contents tdr concessions may also result in the reduction of the alll within the campi and cre portfolios this reduction is derived from payments and the resulting application of the reserve calculation within the alll the transaction reserve for nontdr campi and cre loans is calculated based upon several estimated probability factors such as pd and lgd both of which were previously discussed upon the occurrence of a tdr in our campi and cre portfolios the reserve is measured based on discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs of the modified loan in accordance with asc 31010 the resulting tdr alll calculation often results in a lower alll amount because 1 the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs indicate a lower estimated loss 2 if the modification includes a rate increase the discounting of the cash flows on the modified loan using the premodification interest rate exceeds the carrying value of the loan or 3 payments may occur as part of the modification the alll for campi and cre loans may increase as a result of the modification as the discounted cash flow analysis may indicate additional reserves are required  tdr concessions on consumer loans may increase the alll the concessions made to these borrowers often include interest rate reductions and therefore the tdr alll calculation results in a greater alll compared with the nontdr calculation as the reserve is measured based on the estimation of the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs on the modified loan in accordance with asc 31010 the resulting tdr alll calculation often results in a higher alll amount because 1 the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs indicate a higher estimated loss or 2 due to the rate decrease the discounting of the cash flows on the modified loan using the premodification interest rate indicates a reduction in the expected cash flows or collateral value less anticipated selling costs in certain instances the alll may decrease as a result of payments made in connection with the modification  commercial loan tdrs  in instances where the bank substantiates that it will collect its outstanding balance in full the note is considered for return to accrual status upon the borrower sustaining sufficient cash flows for a sixmonth period of time this sixmonth period could extend before or after the restructure date if a chargeoff was taken as part of the restructuring any interest or principal payments received on that note are applied to first reduce the banks outstanding book balance and then to recoveries of chargedoff principal unpaid interest andor fee expenses while the tdr is in nonaccrual status  residential mortgage automobile home equity and other consumer loan tdrs  modified loans identified as tdrs are aggregated into pools for analysis cash flows and weighted average interest rates are used to calculate impairment at the pooledloan level once the loans are aggregated into the pool they continue to be classified as tdrs until contractually repaid or chargedoff  residential mortgage loans not guaranteed by a us government agency such as the fha va and the usda including tdr loans are reported as accrual or nonaccrual based upon delinquency status nonaccrual tdrs are those that are greater than 150days contractually past due loans guaranteed by us government organizations continue to accrue interest upon delinquency  the following table presents by class and by the reason for the modification the number of contracts postmodification outstanding balance and the financial effects

increase of our riskweighted assets and a reduction to our regulatory capital ratios  the fair values of the private label cmo and cdo assets have been impacted by various market conditions the unrealized losses were primarily the result of wider liquidity spreads on assetbacked securities and increased market volatility on nonagency mortgage and assetbacked securities that are collateralized by certain mortgage loans in addition the expected average lives of the assetbacked securities backed by trustpreferred securities have been extended due to changes in the expectations of when the underlying securities would be repaid the contractual terms and  or cash flows of the investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost huntington does not intend to sell nor does it believe it will be required to sell these securities until the fair value is recovered which may be maturity and therefore does not consider them to be

default percentages  security impairment  huntington evaluated otti on the debt security types listed below  alta mortgagebacked and privatelabel cmo securities are collateralized by firstlien residential mortgage loans the securities are valued by a third party pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and proprietary pricing model the model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds losses recoveries default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities collateral structure types and house price depreciation  appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts   collateralized debt obligations are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of trustpreferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio a third party pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooledtrustpreferred security evaluations is engaged to provide assistance estimating the fair value and expected cash flows on this portfolio the full cash flow analysis is completed by evaluating the relevant credit and structural aspects of each pooledtrustpreferred security in the portfolio including collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in the security and terms of the securitys structure the credit review includes an analysis of profitability credit quality operating efficiency leverage and liquidity using available financial and regulatory information for each underlying collateral issuer the analysis also includes a review of historical industry default data currentnear term operating conditions and the impact of macroeconomic and regulatory changes using the results of our analysis we estimate appropriate default and recovery probabilities for each piece of collateral then estimate the expected cash flows for each security the cumulative probability of default ranges from a low of 1 to 100   130    table of contents many collateral issuers have the option of deferring interest payments on their debt for up to five years for issuers who are deferring interest assumptions are made regarding the issuers ability to resume interest payments and make the required principal payment at maturity the cumulative probability of default for these issuers currently ranges from 1 to 100 and a 10 recovery assumption the fair value of each security is obtained by discounting the expected cash flows at a market discount rate ranging from libor plus 35 to libor plus 153 as of december 31 2013 the market discount rate is determined by reference to yields observed in the market for similarly rated collateralized debt obligations specifically highyield collateralized loan obligations the relatively high market discount rate is reflective of the uncertainty of the cash flows and illiquid nature of these securities the large differential between the fair value and amortized cost of some of the securities reflects the high market discount rate and the expectation that the majority of the cash flows will not be received until near the final maturity of the security the final maturities range from 2032 to 2035  on december 10 2013 the federal reserve the occ the fdic the cftc and the sec issued final rules to implement the volcker rule contained in section 619 of the doddfrank act generally to become effective on july 21 2015 the volcker rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates referred to as banking entities from i engaging in proprietary trading and ii investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds covered funds subject to certain limited exceptions these prohibitions impact the ability of us banking entities to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with nonus banking organizations in overseas markets the rule also effectively prohibits shortterm trading strategies by any us banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for trading  on january 14 2014 the five federal agencies approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of section 619 of the volcker rule under the interim final rule the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities if certain qualifications are met in addition the agencies released a nonexclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of the interim final rule at december 31 2013 we had investments in ten different pools of trust preferred securities eight of our pools are included in the list of nonexclusive issuers we have analyzed the icons and ipre tsl ii pools that were not

occur the precise terms and conditions are typically not readily available therefore the fair value of msrs is estimated using a discounted future cash flow model the model considers portfolio characteristics contractually specified servicing fees and assumptions related to prepayments delinquency rates late charges other ancillary revenues costs to service and other economic factors changes in the assumptions used may have a significant impact on the valuation of msrs  msr values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be greatly impacted by the level of prepayments huntington hedges the value of certain msrs against changes in value attributable to changes in interest rates using a combination of derivative instruments and trading securities    134    table of contents for msrs under the fair value method a summary of key

servicing responsibilities on sold automobile loans and receives annual servicing fees and other ancillary fees on the outstanding loan balances automobile loan servicing rights are accounted for using the amortization method a servicing asset is established at fair value at the time of the sale using a discounted future cash flow model the model considers assumptions related to actual servicing income adequate compensation for servicing and other ancillary fees the servicing asset is then amortized against servicing income impairment if any is recognized when carrying value exceeds the fair value as determined by calculating the present value of expected net future cash flows the primary risk characteristic for measuring servicing assets is payoff rates of the underlying loan pools valuation calculations rely on the predicted payoff assumption and if actual payoff is quicker than expected then future value would be impaired  changes in the carrying value of automobile loan

                       at december 31 2013 huntingtons net deferred tax asset related to loss and other carryforwards was 2039 million this was comprised of federal net operating loss carryforwards of 54 million which will begin expiring in 2023 521 million of state net operating loss carryforward which will begin expiring in 2015 an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of 501 million which may be carried forward indefinitely and a capital loss carryforward of 963 million which will expire in 2015 a valuation allowance of 963 million has been established for the capital loss carryforward because management believes that it is more likely than not that the realization of this asset will not occur  in prior periods huntington established a full valuation allowance against state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards based on the uncertainty of forecasted state taxable income expected in applicable jurisdictions in order to utilize the state deferred tax asset and net operating loss carryforwards based on current analysis of both positive and negative evidence and projected forecasted state taxable income the company believes that it is more likely than not that a portion of the state deferred tax asset and state net operating loss carryforwards will be realized as a result of this analysis the valuation allowance was reduced to 151 million at december 31 2013 compared to 648 million at december 31 2012 for the portion of the deferred tax asset and state net operating loss carryforwards the company expects to realize    148    table of contents 18 benefit plans  huntington sponsors the plan a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees hired or rehired prior to january 1 2010 the plan which was modified during the current year and no longer accrues service benefits to participants provides benefits based upon length of service and compensation levels the funding policy of huntington is to contribute an annual amount that is at least equal to the minimum funding requirements but not more than the amount deductible under the internal revenue code there were no required minimum contributions during 2013  during the 2013 third quarter the board of directors approved and management communicated a curtailment of the companys pension plan effective december 31 2013 as a result of the accounting treatment for the unamortized prior service pension cost and the change in the projected benefit obligation a onetime noncash pretax gain of approximately 339 million was recognized in the 2013 third quarter the net gain includes a gain of 346 million associated with the plan and a loss of 07 million associated with the srip plan  in addition huntington has an unfunded defined benefit postretirement plan that provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees who have attained the age of 55 and have at least 10 years of vesting service under this plan for any employee retiring on or after january 1 1993 postretirement healthcare benefits are based upon the employees number of months of service and are limited to the actual cost of coverage life insurance benefits are a percentage of the employees base salary at the time of retirement with a maximum of 50000 of coverage the employer paid portion of the postretirement health and life insurance plan was eliminated for employees retiring on and after march 1 2010 eligible employees retiring on and after march 1 2010 who elect retiree medical coverage will pay the full cost of this coverage huntington will not provide any employer paid life insurance to employees retiring on and after march 1 2010 eligible employees will be able to convert or port their existing life insurance at their

although not required huntington may choose to make a cash contribution to the plan up to the maximum deductible limit in the 2013 plan year anticipated contributions for 2014 to the postretirement benefit plan are 29 million  the assumed healthcare cost trend rate has an effect on the amounts reported a one percentage point increase would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 1509 thousand and would decrease interest costs by 57 thousand a one percentage point decrease would decrease service costs by 1113 thousand and would increase interest costs by 54 thousand  the 2014 and 2013 healthcare cost trend rate was projected to be 75 for pre65 aged participants and 78 for post65 aged participants these rates are assumed to decrease gradually until they reach 45 for both pre65 aged participants and post65 aged participants in the year 2028 and remain at that level thereafter huntington updated the immediate healthcare cost trend rate assumption based on current market data and huntingtons claims experience this trend rate is expected to decline over time to a trend level consistent with medical inflation and longterm economic assumptions

liabilities  following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy  mortgage loans held for sale  huntington elected to apply the fair value option for mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell which are included in loans held for sale mortgage loans held for sale are classified as level 2 and are estimated using security prices for similar product types    153    table of contents availableforsale securities and trading account securities  securities accounted for at fair value include both the availableforsale and trading portfolios huntington uses prices obtained from third party pricing services and recent trades to determine the fair value of securities afs and trading securities are classified as level 1 using quoted market prices unadjusted in active markets for identical securities that huntington has the ability to access at the measurement date 1 of the positions in these portfolios are level 1 and consist of us treasury securities and money market mutual funds when quoted market prices are not available fair values are classified as level 2 using quoted prices for similar assets in active markets quoted prices of identical or similar assets in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 88 of the positions in these portfolios are level 2 and consist of us government and agency debt securities agency mortgage backed securities assetbacked securities municipal securities and other securities for both level 1 and level 2 securities management uses various methods and techniques to corroborate prices obtained from the pricing service including reference to dealer or other market quotes and by reviewing valuations of comparable instruments if relevant market prices are limited or unavailable valuations may require significant management judgment or estimation to determine fair value in which case the fair values are classified as level 3 11 of our positions are level 3 and consist of nonagency alta assetbacked securities privatelabel cmo securities pooledtrustpreferred cdo securities and municipal securities a significant change in the unobservable inputs for these securities may result in a significant change in the ending fair value measurement of these securities  the alta private label cmo and cdo securities portfolios are classified as level 3 and as such use significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity the alta and private label cmo securities portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows while the cash flows of the pooledtrustpreferred securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties and are used as a basis for impairment analysis  alta mortgagebacked and privatelabel cmo securities are collateralized by firstlien residential mortgage loans the securities valuation methodology incorporates values obtained from a third party pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and a proprietary pricing model and includes assumptions management believes market participants would use to value the securities under current market conditions the model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds losses recoveries default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures house price depreciation  appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts and discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities with similar collateral structures  cdos are backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions the collateral generally consists of cdo securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks bank holding companies and insurance companies a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio we engage a third party pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooledtrustpreferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio the pd of each issuer and the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value management evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the third party pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter actual defaults and deferrals in the current period and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with asc 820  huntington utilizes the same processes to determine the fair value of investment securities classified as heldtomaturity for impairment evaluation purposes  automobile loans  effective january 1 2010 huntington consolidated an automobile loan securitization that previously had been accounted for as an offbalance sheet transaction as a result huntington elected to account for these automobile loan receivables at fair value per guidance supplied in asc 825 the automobile loan receivables are classified as level 3 the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the automobile loan receivables included projections of expected losses and prepayment of the underlying loans in the portfolio and a market assumption of interest rate spreads certain interest rates are available from similarly traded securities while other interest rates are developed internally based on similar assetbacked security transactions in the market  msrs  msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices accordingly the fair value of these assets is classified as level 3 huntington determines the fair value of msrs using an income approach model based upon our monthend interest rate curve and prepayment assumptions the model which is operated and maintained by a third party utilizes assumptions to estimate future net servicing income cash flows including estimates of time decay payoffs and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions servicing brokers and other sources of information eg discussion with other mortgage servicers and industry surveys are used to obtain information on market practice and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis third party marks are obtained from at least one service broker huntington reviews the valuation assumptions against this market data for reasonableness and adjusts the assumptions if deemed appropriate any recommended change in assumptions and  or inputs are presented for review to the mortgage price risk subcommittee for final approval    154    table of contents derivatives  derivatives classified as level 1 consist of exchange traded options and forward commitments to deliver mortgagebacked securities which are valued using quoted prices asset and liability conversion swaps and options and interest rate caps are classified as level 2 these derivative positions are valued using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates current market interest rates derivatives classified as level 3 consist primarily of interest rate lock agreements related to mortgage loan commitments the determination of fair value includes assumptions related to the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan which is a significant unobservable assumption a significant increase or decrease in the external market price would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis

estimates such as probability of default constant default cumulative default loss given default cure given deferral and loss severity are driven by the ability of the borrowers to pay their loans and the value of the underlying collateral and are impacted by changes in macroeconomic conditions typically increasing when economic conditions worsen and decreasing when conditions improve an increase in the estimated prepayment rate typically results in a decrease in estimated credit losses and vice versa higher credit loss estimates generally result in lower fair values credit spreads generally

have shortterm variablerate features and contain clauses that limit huntingtons exposure to changes in customer credit quality accordingly their carrying values which are immaterial at the respective balance sheet dates are reasonable estimates of fair value not all the financial instruments listed in the table above are subject to the disclosure provisions of asc topic 820    161    table of contents certain assets the most significant being operating lease assets bank owned life insurance and premises and equipment do not meet the definition of a financial instrument and are excluded from this disclosure similarly mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights deposit base and other customer relationship intangibles are not considered financial instruments and are not included above accordingly this fair value information is not intended to and does not represent huntingtons underlying value many of the assets and liabilities subject to the disclosure requirements are not actively traded requiring fair values to be estimated by management these estimations necessarily involve the use of judgment about a wide variety of factors including but not limited to relevancy of market prices of comparable instruments expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates  the following methods and assumptions were used by huntington to estimate the fair value of the remaining classes of financial instruments  heldtomaturity securities  fair values are determined by using models that are based on securityspecific details as well as relevant industry and economic factors the most significant of these inputs are quoted market prices and interest rate spreads on relevant benchmark securities  loans and direct financing leases  variablerate loans that reprice frequently are based on carrying amounts as adjusted for estimated credit losses the fair values for other loans and leases are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and employ interest rates currently being offered for loans and leases with similar terms the rates take into account the position of the yield curve as well as an adjustment for prepayment risk operating costs and profit this value is also reduced by an estimate of expected losses and the credit risk associated in the loan and lease portfolio the valuation of the loan portfolio reflected discounts that huntington believed are consistent with transactions occurring in the market place  deposits  demand deposits savings accounts and money market deposits are by definition equal to the amount payable on demand the fair values of fixedrate time deposits are estimated by discounting cash flows using interest rates currently being offered on certificates with similar maturities  debt  fixedrate longterm debt is based upon quoted market prices which are inclusive of huntingtons credit risk in the absence of quoted market prices discounted cash flows using market rates for similar debt with the same maturities are used in the determination of fair value  20 derivative financial instruments  derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities respectively and measured at fair value  derivatives used in asset and liability management activities  huntington engages in balance sheet hedging activity principally for asset liability management purposes to convert fixed rate assets or liabilities into floating rate or vice versa balance sheet hedging activity is arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment and is classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges fair value hedges are purchased to convert deposits and subordinated and other longterm debt from fixedrate obligations to floating rate cash flow hedges are used to convert floating rate loans made to customers into fixed rate loans  the following table presents the gross notional values of

derivative financial instruments are offered to enable customers to meet their financing and investing objectives and for their risk management purposes derivative financial instruments used in trading activities consisted predominantly of interest rate swaps but also included interest rate caps floors and futures as well as foreign exchange options and commodity contracts interest rate options grant the option holder the right to buy or sell an underlying financial instrument for a predetermined price before the contract expires interest rate futures are commitments to either purchase or sell a financial instrument at a future date for a specified price or yield and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying financial instrument interest rate caps and floors are optionbased contracts that entitle the buyer to receive cash payments based on the difference between a designated reference rate and a strike price applied to a notional amount written options primarily caps expose huntington to market risk but not credit risk purchased options contain both credit and market risk the interest rate risk of these customer derivatives is mitigated by entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with other counterparties the credit risk to these customers is evaluated and included in the calculation of fair value  the net fair values of these derivative financial instruments for which the gross amounts are included in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities at december 31 2013 and 2012 were 805 million and 634 million respectively the total notional values of derivative financial instruments used by huntington on behalf of customers including offsetting derivatives were 143 billion and 120 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively huntingtons credit risks from interest rate swaps used for trading purposes were 1604 million and 2961 million at the same dates respectively  financial assets and liabilities that are offset in the consolidated balance sheets  huntington records derivatives at fair value as further described in note 19 huntington records these derivatives net of any master netting arrangement in the consolidated balance sheets collateral agreements are regularly entered into as part of the underlying derivative agreements with huntingtons counterparties to mitigate counterparty credit risk  all derivatives are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value derivative balances are presented on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements cash collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against the applicable derivative fair values huntington enters into derivative transactions with two primary groups brokerdealers and banks and huntingtons customers different methods are utilized for managing counterparty credit exposure and credit risk for each of these groups  huntington enters into transactions with brokerdealers and banks for various risk management purposes these types of transactions generally are high dollar volume huntington enters into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with these counterparties and routinely exchange cash and high quality securities collateral with these counterparties huntington enters into transactions with customers to meet their financing investing payment and risk management needs these types of transactions generally are low dollar volume huntington generally enters into master netting agreements with customer counterparties however collateral is generally not exchanged with customer counterparties  at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 aggregate credit risk associated with these derivatives net of collateral that has been pledged by the counterparty was 152 million and 174 million respectively the credit risk associated with interest rate swaps is calculated after considering master netting agreements with brokerdealers and banks  at december 31 2013 huntington pledged 1137 million of investment securities and cash collateral to counterparties while other counterparties pledged 982 million of investment securities and cash collateral to huntington to satisfy collateral netting agreements in the event of credit downgrades huntington would not be required to provide additional collateral  the following tables present the gross amounts of these assets and liabilities with any offsets to arrive at the net amounts recognized in the consolidated

guarantee ranks subordinate and junior in right of payment to all indebtedness of the company to the same extent as the junior subordinated debt the guarantee does not place a limitation on the amount of additional indebtedness that may be incurred by huntington  low income housing tax credit partnerships  huntington makes certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the low income housing tax credit lihtc pursuant to section 42 of the internal revenue code the purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings and to assist in achieving goals associated with the community reinvestment act the primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification development and operation of multi family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants generally these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity  huntington is a limited partner in each low income housing tax credit partnership a separate unrelated third party is the general partner each limited partnership is managed by the general partner who exercises full and exclusive control over the affairs of the limited partnership the general partner has all the rights powers and authority granted or permitted to be granted to a general partner of a limited partnership under the ohio revised uniform limited partnership act duties entrusted to the general partner of each limited partnership include but are not limited to investment in operating companies company expenditures investment of excess funds borrowing funds employment of agents disposition of fund property prepayment and refinancing of liabilities votes and consents contract authority disbursement of funds accounting methods tax elections bank accounts insurance litigation cash reserve and use of working capital reserve funds except for limited rights granted to consent to certain transactions the limited partners may not participate in the operation management or control of the limited partnerships business transact any business in the limited partnerships name or have any power to sign documents for or otherwise bind the limited partnership in addition the general partner may only be removed by the limited partners in the event the general partner fails to comply with the terms of the agreement andor is negligent in performing its duties  huntington believes the general partner of each limited partnership has the power to direct the activities which most significantly affect their performance of each partnership therefore huntington has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any lihtc partnership huntington uses the equity or effective yield method to account for its investments in these entities these investments are included in accrued income and other assets at december 31 2013 and 2012 huntington has commitments of 5569 million net of amortization 3906 and 5321 million net of amortization 3919 respectively of which 4125 million and 3800 million respectively were funded the unfunded portion is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities  22 commitments and contingent liabilities  commitments to extend credit  in the ordinary course of business huntington makes various commitments to extend credit that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements the contract amounts of these financial agreements at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 were as follows                    at december 31     dollar amounts in thousands   2013     2012     contract amount represents credit risk             commitments to extend credit

commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates are variablerate and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly shortterm variablerate nature    169    table of contents standby lettersofcredit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a borrower to a third party these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements including commercial paper bond financing and similar transactions most of these arrangements mature within two years the carrying amount of deferred revenue associated with these guarantees was 21 million and 14 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively  through the companys credit process huntington monitors the credit risks of outstanding standby lettersofcredit when it is probable that a standby letterofcredit will be drawn and not repaid in full losses are recognized in the provision for credit losses at december 31 2013 huntington had 440 million of standby lettersofcredit outstanding of which 84 were collateralized included in this 440 million total are lettersofcredit issued by the bank that support securities that were issued by customers and remarketed by the huntington investment company the companys brokerdealer subsidiary  huntington uses an internal loan grading system to assess an estimate of loss on its loan and lease portfolio the same loan grading system is used to help monitor credit risk associated with standby lettersofcredit under this risk rating system as of december 31 2013 approximately 96 million of the standby lettersofcredit were rated strong with sufficient asset quality liquidity and good debt capacity and coverage approximately 343 million were rated average with acceptable asset quality liquidity and modest debt capacity and none were rated substandard with negative financial trends structural weaknesses operating difficulties and higher leverage  commercial lettersofcredit represent shortterm selfliquidating instruments that facilitate customer trade transactions and generally have maturities of no longer than 90 days the goods or cargo being traded normally secures these instruments  commitments to sell loans  huntington enters into forward contracts relating to its mortgage banking business to hedge the exposures from commitments to make new residential mortgage loans with existing customers and from mortgage loans classified as loans held for sale at december 31 2013 and 2012 huntington had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of 4526 million and 8498 million respectively these contracts mature in less than one year  litigation  the nature of huntingtons business ordinarily results in a certain amount of claims litigation investigations and legal and administrative cases and proceedings all of which are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business when the company determines it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted it vigorously defends itself the company will consider settlement of cases when in managements judgment it is in the best interests of both the company and its shareholders to do so  on at least a quarterly basis huntington assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available for matters where it is probable the company will incur a loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated huntington establishes an accrual for the loss once established the accrual is adjusted as appropriate to reflect any relevant developments for matters where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated no accrual is established  in certain cases exposure to loss exists in excess of the accrual to the extent such loss is reasonably possible but not probable management believes an estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued for current legal proceedings is from 0 to approximately 1200 million at december 31 2013 for certain other cases management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss at this time any estimate involves significant judgment given the varying stages of the proceedings including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages the existence of multiple defendants in several of the current proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined the numerous unresolved issues in many of the proceedings and the inherent uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings accordingly managements estimate will change from timetotime and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimate  while the final outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain based on information currently available advice of counsel and available insurance coverage management believes that the amount it has already accrued is adequate and any incremental liability arising from the companys legal proceedings will not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial position as a whole however in the event of unexpected future developments it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters if unfavorable may be material to the companys consolidated financial position in a particular period  the following is a discussion of certain legal matters and events occurring through the date of this filing  the bank has been a defendant in three lawsuits which collectively may be material arising from its commercial lending depository and equipment leasing relationships with cyberco holdings inc cyberco based in grand rapids michigan in november 2004 the federal bureau of investigation and the irs raided the cyberco facilities and cybercos operations ceased an equipment leasing fraud was uncovered whereby cyberco sought financing from equipment lessors and financial institutions    170    table of contents  including the bank allegedly to purchase computer equipment from teleservices group inc teleservices cyberco created fraudulent documentation to close the financing transactions while in fact no computer equipment was ever purchased or leased from teleservices which proved to be a shell corporation  on june 22 2007 a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of michigan district court was filed by el camino resources ltd eplus group inc and bank midwest na all of whom had financing relationships with cyberco against the bank which alleged that cyberco defrauded plaintiffs and converted plaintiffs property through various means in connection with the equipment leasing scheme and alleged that the bank aided and abetted cyberco in committing the alleged fraud and conversion the complaint further alleged that the banks actions entitled one of the plaintiffs to recover 19 million from the bank as a form of unjust enrichment in addition plaintiffs claimed direct damages of approximately 320 million and additional consequential damages in excess of 200 million on july 1 2010 the district court issued an opinion and order adopting in full a federal magistrates recommendation for summary judgment in favor of the bank on all claims except the unjust enrichment claim and a partial summary judgment was entered on july 1 2010 on february 6 2012 the district court dismissed the remaining count for unjust enrichment following a finding by the bankruptcy court that the plaintiff must pursue its rights if any with respect to that count in a bankruptcy court the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on march 2 2012 appealing the district courts judgment against them on the aiding and abetting and conversion claims oral arguments before the sixth circuit court of appeals were held january 24 2013 and the sixth circuit court of appeals affirmed the district courts judgment in an opinion issued on april 8 2013 the plaintiffs then filed a motion for rehearing en banc which the sixth circuit denied on may 30 2013 the period for plaintiffs to seek review in the united states supreme court has passed and the case is completed  the bank has also been involved with the chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings of both cyberco filed on december 9 2004 and teleservices filed on january 21 2005 the cyberco bankruptcy trustee commenced an adversary proceeding against the bank on december 8 2006 seeking over 700 million he alleged was transferred to the bank the bank responded with a motion to dismiss and all but the preference claims were dismissed on january 29 2008 the cyberco bankruptcy trustee alleged preferential transfers in the amount of approximately 12 million the bankruptcy court ordered the case to be tried in july 2012 and entered a pretrial order governing all pretrial conduct the bank filed a motion for summary judgment based on the cyberco trustee seeking recovery in connection with the same alleged transfers as the teleservices trustee in the case described below the bankruptcy court granted the motion in principal part and the parties stipulated to a full dismissal which was entered on june 19 2012  the teleservices bankruptcy trustee filed an adversary proceeding against the bank on january 19 2007 seeking to avoid and recover alleged transfers that occurred in two ways 1 checks made payable to the bank to be applied to cybercos indebtedness to the bank and 2 deposits into cybercos bank accounts with the bank a trial was held as to only the banks defenses subsequently the trustee filed a summary judgment motion on her affirmative case alleging the fraudulent transfers to the bank totaled approximately 730 million and seeking judgment in that amount which includes the 12 million alleged to be preferential transfers by the cyberco bankruptcy trustee on march 17 2011 the bankruptcy court issued an opinion determining the alleged transfers made to the bank were not received in good faith from the time period of april 30 2004 through november 2004 and that the bank had failed to show a lack of knowledge of the avoidability of the alleged transfers from september 2003 through april 30 2004 the trustee then filed an amended motion for summary judgment on her affirmative case and a hearing was held on july 1 2011  on march 30 2012 the bankruptcy court issued an opinion on the trustees motion determining the bank was the initial transferee of the checks made payable to it and was a subsequent transferee of all deposits into cybercos accounts the bankruptcy court ruled cybercos deposits were themselves transfers to the bank under the bankruptcy code and the bank was liable for both the checks and the deposits totaling approximately 730 million the bankruptcy court ruled the bank may be entitled to a credit of approximately 40 million for the cyberco trustees recoveries in preference actions filed against third parties that received payments from cyberco within 90 days preceding cybercos bankruptcy lastly the bankruptcy court ruled that it will award prejudgment interest to the teleservices trustee at a rate to be determined a trial was held on these remaining issues on april 30 2012 and the court gave a bench opinion on july 23 2012 in that opinion the court denied the bank the 40 million credit but ruled approximately 09 million in deposits were either doublecounted or were outside the timeframe in which the teleservices trustee can recover therefore the bankruptcy courts recommended award was reduced by this 09 million further the bankruptcy court ruled the interest rate specified in the federal statute governing postjudgment interest which is based on treasury bill rates will be the rate of interest for determining prejudgment interest the rulings of the bankruptcy court in its march 2011 and march 2012 opinions as well as its july 23 2012 bench opinion were not reduced to judgment by the bankruptcy court because it lacked jurisdiction to enter a judgment rather the bankruptcy court delivered its report and recommendation to the district court for the western district of michigan recommending a judgment be entered in the principal amount of 718 million plus interest through july 27 2012 in the amount of 88 million the district court is conducting a de novo review of the fact findings and legal conclusions in the bankruptcy courts opinions  in the pending bankruptcy cases of cyberco and teleservices the bank moved to substantively consolidate the two bankruptcy estates principally on the ground that teleservices was the

sixth circuit when the bankruptcy court issued its march 17 2010 opinion in the teleservices adversary proceeding the bank again appealed the order denying substantive consolidation to the bap which
