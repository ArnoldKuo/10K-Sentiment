healthcare industry in the united states us we are a maryland corporation organized in 1985 and qualify as a selfadministered real estate investment trust reit we are headquartered in irvine california with offices in nashville and san francisco our diverse portfolio is comprised of investments in the following reportable healthcare segments i senior housing triplenet sh nnn ii senior housing operating portfolio shop iii life science and iv medical office  		 		 			on october 31 2016 we completed the spinoff the spinoff of quality care properties inc qcp nyseqcp the spinoff included 338 properties primarily comprised of the hcr manorcare inc hcrmc direct financing lease dfl investments and an equity investment in hcrmc qcp is an independent publiclytraded selfmanaged and selfadministrated reit see notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the spinoff 		 		 			  		 		 			for a description of our significant activities during 2016 see item 7 in this report 		 		 			  		 		 			business strategy 		 		 			we invest and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize the benefit to our stockholders and support the growth of our dividends the core elements of our strategy are i to acquire develop lease own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across multiple geographic locations and business segments including senior housing medical office and life science among others ii to align ourselves with leading healthcare companies operators and service providers which over the longterm should result in higher relative rental rates net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values iii to maintain adequate liquidity with longterm fixed rate debt financing with staggered maturities which supports the longerterm nature of our investments while reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk at any point in the interest rate or credit cycles and iv to continue to manage our balance sheet with a targeted financial leverage of 40 relative to our assets 		 		 			internal growth strategies 		 		 			we believe our real estate portfolio holds the potential for increased future cash flows as it is wellmaintained and in desirable locations within markets where new supply is generally limited by the lack of available sites and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary licensing other approvals andor financing our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties  		 		 			we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			build and maintain longterm leasing and management relationships with quality tenants and operators in choosing locations for our properties we focus on their physical environment adjacency to established businesses eg hospital systems and educational centers proximity to sources of business growth and other local demographic factors 		 			 				  			 		 			 			replace tenants and operators at the best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs we believe that we are wellpositioned to attract new tenants and operators and achieve attractive rental rates and operating cash flow as a result of the location design and maintenance of our properties together with our reputation for highquality building services and responsiveness to tenants and our ability to offer space alternatives within our portfolio 		 			 		  		 			3 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			extend and modify terms of existing leases prior to expiration we structure lease extensions early renewals or modifications which reduce the cost associated with lease downtime or the reinvestment risk resulting from the exercise of tenants purchase options while securing the tenancy and relationship of our high quality tenants and operators on a longterm basis 		 			investment strategies 		 		 			the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling longterm demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector 		 		 			while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies 		 		 			we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment vehicle or geographic location the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator or loans that may be made to a single borrower in allocating capital we target opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for our portfolio as a whole we may take additional measures to mitigate risk including diversifying our investments by sector geography tenant or operator structuring transactions as master leases requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications and obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits 		 		 			we believe we are wellpositioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions financing and development other factors that contribute to our competitive position include  		 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our reputation gained through over 30 years of successful operations and the strength of our existing portfolio of properties 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with leading healthcare operators and systems investment banks and other market intermediaries corporations private equity firms nonprofits and public institutions seeking to monetize existing assets or develop new facilities 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of highquality healthcare real estate 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions responsively and efficiently which provides confidence to domestic and foreign institutions and private investors who seek to sell healthcare real estate in our market areas 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the healthcare and real estate industries and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our control of sites including assets under contract with radius restrictions 		 			financing strategies 		 		 			our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains therefore we dont retain a significant amount of capital as a result we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt  		 		 			we may finance acquisitions and other investments through the following vehicles 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			borrowings under our credit facility  		 			 				  			 		 			 			issuance or origination of debt including unsecured notes term loans and mortgage debt  		 			 		  		 			4 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			sale of ownership interests in properties or other investments or  		 			 				  			 		 			 			issuance of common or preferred stock or equivalent 		 			we maintain a disciplined balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity our debt obligations are primarily longterm fixed rate with staggered maturities 		 		 			we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing by offering debt and equity securities placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders and joint venture partners 		 		 			  		 		 			segments  		 		 			the following table summarizes our revenues by segment in thousands

utilizing triplenet leases and ridea structures which are permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 commonly referred to as ridea and include independent living facilities ilfs assisted living facilities alfs memory care facilities mcfs care homes and continuing care retirement communities ccrcs which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs services provided by our tenants or operators in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 		 		 			we have entered into longterm agreements with operators including brookdale senior living inc brookdale to operate and manage properties that are operated under a ridea structure under the provisions of ridea a reit may lease a qualified healthcare property on an arms length basis to a taxable reit subsidiary trs if the property is managed on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an eligible independent contractor ridea structures allow us to own the risks and rewards of the operations of healthcare facilities as compared to leasing the property for contractual triplenet rents in a tax efficient manner we view ridea as a structure primarily to be used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points andor growth profiles by i transitioning the asset to a new operator that can bring scale operating efficiencies andor ancillary services or ii investing capital to reposition the asset brookdale provides comprehensive facility management and accounting services with respect to a majority of our senior housing ridea properties for which we pay annual management fees pursuant to the aforementioned agreements most of the management agreements have terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with three to four 5year renewals the base management fees are 45 to 50 of gross revenues as defined generated by the ridea facilities in addition there are incentive management fees payable to brookdale if operating results of the ridea properties exceed preestablished ebitdar defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and rent thresholds  		 		 			our senior housing property types under both triplenet leases and ridea structures are further described below

housekeeping meals and activities additionally the programs and services may include transportation social activities exercise and fitness programs beauty or barber shop access hobby and craft activities community excursions meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents these residents generally do not need assistance with activities of daily living adl however in some of our facilities residents have the option to contract for these services  		 			 		  		 			5 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			assisted living facilities alfs are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services support and housing for those who need help with adl such as bathing eating dressing and medication management yet require limited medical care these facilities are often in apartmentlike buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments certain alfs may have a dedicated portion of a facility that offers higher levels of personal assistance for residents requiring memory care as a result of alzheimers disease or other forms of dementia levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations  		 			 				  			 		 			 			memory care facilities mcfs address the unique challenges of our residents with alzheimers disease or other forms of dementia residents may live in semiprivate apartments or private rooms and have structured activities delivered by staff members trained specifically on how to care for residents with memory impairment these facilities offer programs that provide comfort and care in a secure environment  		 			 				  			 		 			 			continuing care retirement communities ccrcs offer several levels of assistance including independent living assisted living and nursing home care ccrcs are different from other housing and care options for seniors because they usually provide written agreements or longterm contracts between residents and the communities frequently lasting the term of the residents lifetime which offer a continuum of housing services and healthcare on one campus or site ccrcs are appealing as they allow residents to age in place ccrcs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry  		 			the following table provides information about our sh nnn tenant concentration for the

sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater flexibility eg nonreit competitors resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by global national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and

a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see item 1a risk factors in this report 		 		 			  		 		 			government regulation licensing and enforcement  		 		 			overview 		 		 			our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care licensure and certificate of need government reimbursement fraud and abuse practices and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws regulations reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under item 1a risk factors in this report 		 		 			based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators including our medical office segment at december 31 2016 we estimate that approximately 13 and 12 15 and 14 excluding our medical office segment of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement respectively 		 		 			the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 		 		 			fraud and abuse enforcement 		 		 			there are various extremely complex us federal and state laws and regulations and in relation to our facilities located in the uk national laws and regulations of england scotland northern ireland and wales governing healthcare providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i us federal state false claims acts and uk antifraud legislation and regulation which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other us federal or state or uk healthcare programs ii us federal state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit or restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services and uk legislation and regulations on financial inducements and vested interests iii us federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the stark law which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v us federal state and uk privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 commonly referred to as hipaa and the uk data protection act 1988 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of us and uk healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and in the us can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions many of our tenants and operators are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws 		 		 			 		  		 			8 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			reimbursement  		 		 			sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare programs and state medicaid programs and in the uk the national health service nhs and local authority funding and nongovernmental thirdparty payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government many states face significant current and future budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators similarly in the uk the nhs and the local authorities are undertaking efforts to reduce costs which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by our uk tenants and operators additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the us including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations aco and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants and operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations  		 		 			healthcare licensure and certificate of need 		 		 			certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio including our facilities located in the uk are subject to extensive national federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to handle controlled substances including narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states in the us require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants and operators abilities to expand or change their businesses 		 		 			life science facilities 		 		 			while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 		 		 			senior housing entrance fee communities 		 		 			certain of our senior housing facilities are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facilitys financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 		 		 			americans with disabilities act the ada 		 		 			our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 		 		 			environmental matters 		 		 			a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an  		  		 			9 		   		 			table of contents 		 owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in

of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the value of such property and the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our earnings for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see item 1a risk factors in this report 		 		 			  		 		 			insurance 		 		 			we obtain various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property business interruption liability flood windstorm earthquake environmental and terrorism related losses we attempt to obtain appropriate policy terms conditions limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss the cost of such coverage and current industry practice there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable in addition we have a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake flood and windstorm occurrences which carry higher deductibles 		 		 			we maintain property insurance for all of our properties and this insurance is primary for our shop ridea life science and medical office segments tenants under triplenet leases primarily in our sh nnn segment are required to provide primary property business interruption and liability insurance we maintain separate general and professional liability insurance for our shop ridea facilities additionally our corporate general liability insurance program also extends coverage for all of our properties beyond the aforementioned we periodically review whether we or our ridea operators will bear responsibility for maintaining the required insurance coverage for the applicable shop properties but the costs of such insurance are facility expenses paid from the revenues of those properties regardless of who maintains the insurance  		 		 			we also maintain directors and officers

			item 1a risk factors  		 		 			the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			as set forth below we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to our business and operations 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to our capital structure and market conditions  		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to other events and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to tax including reitrelated risks 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			risks related to our business and operations 		 		 			we depend on one tenant and operator brookdale for a significant percentage of our revenues and net operating income continuing adverse developments including operational challenges in brookdales business and affairs or financial condition would likely have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			we manage our facilities utilizing ridea and triplenet lease lease arrangements structures as of december 31 2016 brookdale leased or managed 212 senior housing facilities that we own and 16 shop facilities owned by our unconsolidated joint venture pursuant to longterm lease and management agreements  		 		 			  		 		 			properties managed by brookdale under ridea structures as of december 31 2016 accounted for 18 of our gross segment assets services provided by our managers in facilities managed under a ridea structure are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs we report the resident level fees and services revenues and corresponding operating expenses in our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			  		 		 			 		  		 			11 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			in addition to our ridea structures with brookdale our leases with respect to brookdale as a tenant accounted for 12 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 		 		 			  		 		 			although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements we rely on brookdales personnel expertise technical resources and information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage our related senior living operations efficiently and effectively we also rely on brookdale to set appropriate resident fees manage occupancy provide accurate and complete propertylevel financial results for these senior housing communities in a timely manner and otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations 		 		 			  		 		 			in its capacity as a manager in the ridea structures brookdale does not lease our properties and therefore our exposure to its credit risk is in a different manner as compared to a triplenet tenant brookdale has experienced significant challenges in integrating its july 2014 acquisition of emeritus corp and has been adversely affected by increased competition that has negatively impacted occupancy rates and in certain cases brookdale has offered additional discounts and incentives to residents brookdale as well as our other operators has also experienced labor expense pressure and increased labor turnover 		 		 			  		 		 			in its capacity as a triplenet tenant we depend on brookdale to pay all insurance tax utilities maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties we depend on adequate maintenance and repair of the properties to remain competitive and attract and retain patients and residents adverse developments in brookdales business and related declining rent coverage ratios have increased its credit risk if these adverse developments result in prolonged inadequate property maintenance or improvements or impair brookdales access to capital necessary for maintenance or improvements it could lead to a significant reduction in occupancy rates and market rents which would likely have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			  		 		 			brookdales operational challenges and potential adverse developments in its business affairs and financial results could significantly divert managements attention increase employee turnover and impair its ability to manage the properties or its operations efficiently and effectively this could ultimately result in among other adverse events acceleration of brookdales indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code 		 		 			  		 		 			in addition brookdale depends on private sources for its revenues and the ability of its patients and residents to pay its fees for example costs associated with independent and assisted living services are not generally reimbursable under governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid accordingly brookdale depends on attracting seniors with appropriate levels of income and assets which may be affected by many factors including prevailing economic and market trends consumer confidence and demographics consequently if brookdale fails to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties it would adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which would have a materially adverse effect on its and our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			  		 		 			brookdale also relies on reimbursements from governmental programs for a portion of its revenues changes in reimbursement policies and other governmental regulation such as potential changes to or repeal of the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the affordable care act that may result from the new presidential administration may result in reductions in brookdales revenues operations and cash flows and affect its ability to meet its obligations to us for a further discussion of the legislation and regulation that are applicable to us and our tenants operators and borrowers see legislation and regulationthe requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants operators and borrowers ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us while brookdale generally has also agreed to indemnify us for various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with its business it may have insufficient assets income access to financing andor insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy its indemnification obligations 		 		 			  		 		 			 		  		 			12 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			the inability unwillingness or other failure of brookdale under its lease agreements and ridea structures to meet its obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow net operating income and results of operations and have other materially adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major tenants operators or borrowers may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to third party tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties we are also a direct or indirect lender to various tenants and operators we have very limited control over the success or failure of our tenants and operators businesses any of our tenants or operators may experience a downturn in its business that materially weakens its financial condition as a result they may fail to make payments when due although we generally have arrangements and other agreements that give us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or operator or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches  		 		 			a downturn in any of our tenants or operators businesses could ultimately lead to bankruptcy if it is unable to timely resolve the underlying causes which may be largely outside of its control bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies and realize any recoveries in connection therewith for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing  		 		 			a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its executory contracts and unexpired leases in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us obligations under such rejected leases would cease the claim against the rejecting debtor would be an unsecured claim which would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code this statutory cap may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may also assert in bankruptcy proceedings that leases should be recharacterized as financing agreements which could result in our being deemed a lender instead of a landlord a lenders rights and remedies as compared to a landlords generally are materially more unfavorable 		 		 			furthermore the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies unless we first obtain relief from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case this would effectively limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent and we may ultimately not receive any payment at all in addition we would likely be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes insurance debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant operator or manager additionally we lease many of our facilities to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting these operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may involve specific procedural or regulatory requirements and may not be successful even if eviction is possible we may determine not to do so due to reputational or other risks  		 		 			bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings may also result in increased costs to the operator and significant management distraction if we are unable to transition affected properties they could experience prolonged operational disruption leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues publicity about the operators financial condition and insolvency proceeds may also negatively impact their and our reputations decreasing customer demand and revenues any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues results of operations and cash flows these risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties 		 		 			 		  		 			13 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			additionally the financial weakness or other inability of our tenants operators or borrowers to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the

mortgages may result in cross default under our other indebtedness although we may be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of a borrower tenant or operator may result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other materially adverse consequences 		 		 			increased competition and market and legislative changes have resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our tenants operators and borrowers and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 		 		 			the healthcare industry is highly competitive the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area in addition our tenants operators and borrowers face an increasingly competitive labor market for skilled management personnel and nurses an inability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and nurses and other trained personnel could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures on wages may force tenants operators and borrowers to enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for skilled personnel or to use more expensive contract personnel but they be unable to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses or any failure by our tenants operators or borrowers to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our cash flow and have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			our tenants operators and borrowers also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers this competition which is due in part to overdevelopment in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease our tenants operators and borrowers may be unable to achieve occupancy and rate levels and to manage their expenses in a way that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants operators and borrowers our tenants operators and borrowers may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses or to manage their expenses either of which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues and impairing our assets andor increasing collection and dispute costs 		 		 			in addition our operators revenues are determined by a number of factors including licensed bed capacity occupancy the healthcare needs of residents the rate of reimbursement and or a decrease the income or assets of seniors in the regions in which we operate for example due to generally increased vulnerability to illness occupancy at our senior housing facilities could significantly decrease in the event of a severe flu season an epidemic or any other widespread illness additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the united states including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations and bundled payments have resulted in reduced reimbursement rates average length of stay and average daily census particularly for higher acuity patients 		 		 			furthermore the new presidential administration and new congress has introduced uncertainty in the direction of the healthcare regulatory landscape and we cannot predict the impact of any regulatory or legislative changes on the industry or our ability to compete effectively therein see the risks described under legislation and regulationthe requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants operators and borrowers ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us

sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities similarly our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators or may reduce the rents we are able to charge if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms or attract and retain profitable tenants and operators our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 		 		 			we depend on investments in the healthcare property sector making our profitability more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in that specific sector than if we were investing in multiple industries 		 		 			we concentrate our investments in the healthcare property sector as a result we are subject to risks inherent to investments in a single industry a downturn or slowdown in the healthcare property sector would have a greater adverse impact on our business than if we had investments in multiple industries specifically a downturn in the healthcare property sector could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us as well as the ability to maintain rental and occupancy rates this could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a downturn in the healthcare property sector could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties at prices or on terms acceptable to us 		 		 			in addition real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in the performance of our properties or economic and other conditions is limited we may be unable to recognize full value for any property that we seek to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular health care industries 		 		 			changes within the life science industry may adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 		 		 			our life science investments could be adversely affected if the life science industry is impacted by an economic financial or banking crisis or if the life science industry migrates from the us to other countries or to areas outside of primary markets in south san francisco and san diego also some of our properties may be better suited for a particular life science industry client tenant and could require modification before we are able to release vacant space to another life science industry client tenant generally our properties may not be suitable for lease to traditional office client tenants without significant expenditures on renovations 		 		 			our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations on future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and the demand for life science properties at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are proposed 		 		 			many life science entities have completed mergers or consolidations mergers or consolidations of life science entities in the future could reduce the amount of rentable square footage requirements of our client tenants and prospective client tenants which may adversely impact our revenues from lease payments and results of operations 		 		 			the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems could fail to remain

of scale and access to capital if a hospital whose campus is located on or near one of our mobs is unable to meet its financial obligations and if an affiliated healthcare system is unable to support that hospital the hospital may not be able to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcarerelated users because we rely on our proximity to and affiliations with these hospitals to create tenant demand for space in our mobs their inability to remain competitive or financially viable or to attract physicians and physician groups could adversely affect our mob operations and have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			in addition the potential repeal of the affordable care act and related regulations and uncertainty regarding potential replacement legislation could result in significant changes to the scope of insurance coverage and reimbursement policies which could put negative pressure on the operations and revenues of our mobs 		 		 			we may be unable to maintain or expand our relationships with our existing and future hospital and health system clients 		 		 			the success of our medical office portfolio depends to a large extent on past current and future relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems we invest significant amounts of time in developing relationships with both new and existing clients if we fail to maintain these relationships including through a lack of responsiveness failure to adapt to the current market and employment of individuals with adequate experience our reputation and relationships will be harmed and we may lose business to competitors if our relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems deteriorate it could have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas from which a greater percentage of our revenues is recognized could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			for the year ended december 31 2016 26 of our revenue was derived from properties located in california which is also where substantially all of our lifescience portfolio is located as a result we may be subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting the state including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions increased competition or decreased demand changes in statespecific legislation and local climate events and natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires and hurricanes which could cause significant disruption in our businesses in the region harm our ability to compete effectively result in increased costs and divert more management attention any or all of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 		 		 			if we must replace any of our tenants or operators we may have difficulty identifying replacements and we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other tenants and operators 		 		 			we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term if we or our tenants terminate or do not renew the leases for our properties we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific and may be subject to regulatory requirements a new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property depending on that tenants or operators particular business in addition infrastructure improvements for life science facilities typically are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types and we may be unable to recover part or all of these higher costs therefore if a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent andor vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property and experience delays before we are able to secure another tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators these expenditures or renovations and delays may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			additionally we may fail to identify suitable replacements or enter into leases or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases if at all we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations such as real estate taxes debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of and avoid the imposition of liens on our properties while they are being

result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters labor conditions material shortages regulatory hurdles civil unrest and acts of war which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses or provide tenants or operators with the right to terminate preconstruction leases and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			occupancy rates and rents at a newly

requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants operators and borrowers ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants operators and borrowers for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our tenants and operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance or cause our borrowers to be unable to meet their obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits arising from the alleged actions of our tenants or operators for which claims such tenants and

the facility as an independent contractor as the owner of the facility contracting out operational responsibility we assume more of the operational risk relative to other structures because we lease

ability to control operating expenses our trs and hence we are responsible for any operating deficits incurred by the facility 		 		 			the operator which would be our trs when we use a ridea lease structure of a healthcare facility is generally required to be the holder of the applicable healthcare license this licensing requirement subjects our trs and us through our ownership interest in our

adverse effect on us 		 		 			sometimes governmental payors freeze or reduce payments to healthcare providers or provide annual reimbursement rate increases that are smaller than expected due to budgetary and other pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our tenants operators and borrowers costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the

the marketplace for a historically long period of time in december 2016 the us federal reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point at this point it is uncertain what impact the december rate increase might have on us additionally market interest rates may continue to increase and the increase may materially and negatively affect us if interest rates increase so could our interest costs for any variable rate debt and for new debt this increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 		 		 			we manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and through the use of derivative instruments primarily interest rate swap agreements however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates swap agreements involve risk including that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than would otherwise be the case

which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new

consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to

to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit eampp of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such eampp distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such eampp distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such eampp distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of eampp including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit eampp moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit eampp which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 		 		 			thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit eampp by the close of the first taxable year in which the

permanent the reduction of the recognition period from ten years to five years during which an entity that converted from a corporation to a reit or was acquired by a reit is subject to a corporatelevel tax on builtin gains recognized during such period which could influence the types of investments we enter into in the future the act also makes multiple changes related to the foreign

lastly the act adjusts the way we may calculate certain earnings and profits calculations to avoid double taxation at the stockholder level and expands the types of qualifying assets and income for

adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline rents dfl noncash interest amortization of market lease intangibles nonrefundable entrance fees and lease termination fees noncash adjustments adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as cash noi we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations to assess and compare property level performance and to evaluate our same property portfolio spp as described below we believe that net income loss is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income loss as defined by gaap since it does not reflect various excluded items further our definition of noi may not be comparable to the definition used by other reits or real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi for a reconciliation of noi and adjusted noi to net income loss by segment refer to note 14 to the

			funds from operations  		 		 			we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 		 		 			ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit is net income loss applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property including any current and deferred taxes directly associated with sales of depreciable property impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and other depreciation and amortization and adjustments to compute our share of ffo and ffo as adjusted see below from joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our prorata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures we reflect our share of ffo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis we reflect our share for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our ffo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods our prorata share information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts is intended to reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio and is calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period we do not

not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income loss we compute ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition however other reits may report ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours 		 		 			in addition we present ffo before the impact of noncomparable items

management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community we believe stockholders potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating performance are best served by an ffo runrate earnings measure that includes in addition to adjustments made to arrive at the nareit defined measure of ffo other adjustments to net income loss ffo as adjusted is used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand this measure used by management we use ffo as adjusted to i evaluate our performance in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv assess our performance as compared with similar real estate companies and the industry in general and v evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results other reits or real estate

makes comparisons with i expected results ii results of previous periods and iii results among reits more meaningful fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as it excludes the following items which generally flow through our cash flows from operating activities i

unconsolidated joint ventures see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 		 			 		  		 			63 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			critical accounting policies 		 		 			the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 		 		 			  		 		 			principles of consolidation  		 		 			the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 		 		 			we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether i the equity investors as a group do not have a controlling financial interest ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support or iii substantially all of the entitys activities involve or are performed on behalf of an equity investor that holds disproportionately few voting rights we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entitys governing body the size and seniority of our investment and our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a reanalysis of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the vie our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 		 		 			if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie we would require the vie to provide us timely financial information and would review the internal controls of the vie to determine if we could rely on the financial information it provides if the vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting 		 		 			  		 		 			revenue recognition 		 		 			at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying propertys economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs is equal to 90 or more of the excess estimated fair value over retained tax credits of the leased asset if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease if the assumptions utilized in the above classifications assessments were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus  		  		 			64 		   		 			table of contents 		 the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of a tenant improvement is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 		 		 			certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent is dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for operating lease straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent receivable amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of future minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unamortized unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment if these assessments were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 		 		 			loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans if management determined that certain loans should no longer be classified as heldforinvestment the timing and amount of our interest income recognized would be impacted 		 		 			loans receivable and dfls collectively finance receivables are reviewed and assigned an internal rating of performing watch list or workout finance receivables that are deemed performing meet all present contractual obligations and collection and timing of all amounts owed is reasonably assured watch list finance receivables are defined as finance receivables that do not meet the definition of performing or workout workout finance receivables are defined as finance receivables in which we have determined based on current information and events that i it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement ii the tenant operator or borrower is delinquent on making payments under the contractual terms of the agreement iii and we have commenced action or anticipate pursuing action in the near term to seek recovery of our investment 		 		 			 		  		 			65 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured the asset will have an internal rating of either watch list or workout further we perform a credit analysis to support the tenants operators borrowers andor guarantors repayment capacity and the underlying collateral values we use the cash basis method of accounting for finance receivables placed on nonaccrual status unless one of the following conditions exist whereby we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting i if we determine that it is probable that we will only recover the recorded investment in the finance receivable net of associated allowances or chargeoffs if any or ii we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of an impaired finance receivable for cash basis method of accounting we apply payments received excluding principal paydowns to interest income so long as that amount does not exceed the amount that would have been earned under the original contractual terms for cost recovery method of accounting any payment received is applied to reduce the recorded investment generally we return a finance receivable to accrual status when all delinquent payments become current under the terms of the loan or lease agreements and collectibility of the remaining contractual loan or lease payments is reasonably assured 		 		 			allowances are established for finance receivables on an individual basis utilizing an estimate of probable losses if they are determined to be impaired finance receivables are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessees or borrowers overall financial condition economic resources payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivables effective interest rate fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors as appropriate should a finance receivable be deemed partially or wholly uncollectible the uncollectible balance is charged off against the allowance in the period in which the uncollectible determination has been made 		 		 			  		 		 			real estate 		 		 			we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of allocating fair value to inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases 		 		 			a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project to be considered substantially complete and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 		 		 			 		  		 			66 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			  		 		 			impairment of longlived assets  		 		 			we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be recoverable but at least annually recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 		 		 			the determination of the fair value of real estate assets involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results resulting cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 		 		 			  		 		 			investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 		 		 			the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment indicators based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of a fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 		 		 			  		 		 			income taxes 		 		 			as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential

foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 3 million 		 		 			  		 		 			interest rate risk 		 		 			at december 31 2016 we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates primarily on variable rate debt as of december 31 2016 317 million of our variablerate debt was hedged by interest rate swap transactions the interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting the interest rates on our variablerate debt to fixed interest rates  		 		 			interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing if interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt whether at maturity or otherwise our future earnings and cash flows could adversely be affected by additional borrowing costs conversely lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments assuming a one percentage point change in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt and investments by approximately 56 million and 8 million respectively and would not materially impact earnings or cash flows conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not materially impact the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point change in the interest rate related to our variablerate debt and variablerate investments and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2016 our annual interest expense and interest income would change by approximately 15 million and 1 million respectively 		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			foreign currency exchange rate risk 		 		 			at december 31 2016 our exposure to foreign currencies primarily relates to uk investments in leased real estate senior notes and related gbp denominated cash flows our foreign currency exposure is partially mitigated through the use of gbp denominated borrowings and foreign currency swap contracts based solely on our operating results for the year ended december 31 2016 including the impact of existing hedging arrangements if the value of the gbp relative to the us dollar were to increase or decrease by 10 compared to the average exchange rate during

accounting principles gaap these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from managements estimates 		 		 			principles of consolidation 		 		 			  		 		 			the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc its whollyowned subsidiaries joint ventures and variable interest entities that it controls through voting rights or other means intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation 		 		 			the company is required to continually evaluate its vie relationships and consolidate these entities when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of their operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support ii substantially all of an entitys activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights or iii the equity investors as a group lack any of the following a the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of an entity 		 		 			a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie the company qualitatively assesses whether it is or is not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to its form of ownership interest its representation on the vies governing body the size and seniority of its investment its ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions and its ability to replace the vie manager andor liquidate the entity 		 		 			for its investments in joint ventures that are not considered to be vies the company evaluates the type of ownership rights held by the limited partners that may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership the assessment of limited partners rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the limited partner rights ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership interest in the limited partnership or iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests the company similarly evaluates the rights of managing members of limited liability companies 		 		 			 		  		 			77 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			revenue recognition 		 		 			at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments the company assesses its terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying propertys economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs is equal to 90 or more of the excess fair value over retained tax credits of the leased property if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease dfl 		 		 			the company utilizes the direct finance method of accounting to record dfl income for a lease accounted for as a dfl the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property less the unamortized unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease term to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured 		 		 			the company commences recognition of rental revenue for operating lease arrangements when the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the companyowned tenant improvements are substantially completed if a lease arrangement provides for tenant improvements the company determines whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or the company when the company is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvements funded by the tenant are treated as lease payments which are deferred and amortized into income over the lease term when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance that is funded by the company is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term ownership of tenant improvements is determined based on various factors including but not limited to the following criteria 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			lease stipulations of how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent 		 			 				  			 		 			 			which party to the arrangement retains legal title to the tenant improvements upon lease expiration 		 			 				  			 		 			 			whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general purpose in nature and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			if the tenant improvements are expected to have significant residual value at the end of the lease term 		 			certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds and only after any contingency has been removed when the related thresholds are achieved this may result in the recognition of rental revenue in periods subsequent to when such payments are received 		 		 			tenant recoveries subject to operating leases generally relate to the reimbursement of real estate taxes insurance and repairs and maintenance expense these expenses are recognized as revenue in the period they are incurred the reimbursements of these expenses are recognized and presented gross as the company is generally the primary obligor and with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the associated credit risk 		 		 			for operating leases with minimum scheduled rent increases the company recognizes income on a straight line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured recognizing rental income on a straight line basis results in a difference in the timing of revenue amounts from what is contractually due from tenants if the company determines that collectibility of straight line rents is not reasonably assured future revenue recognition is limited to amounts contractually owed and paid and when appropriate an allowance for estimated losses is established 		 		 			resident fee revenue is recorded when services are

herein referred to as the revenue asus i asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asu 201409 ii asu no 201608 principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net asu 201608 and iii asu no 201612 narrowscope improvements and practical expedients asu 201612 asu 201409 provides guidance for revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services asu 201608 is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations asu 201612 provides practical expedients and improvements on the previously narrow scope of asu 201409 in august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201514 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 deferral of the effective date asu 201514 asu 201514 defers the effective date of asu 201409 by one year to fiscal years and interim periods within beginning after december 15 2017 all subsequent asus related to asu 201409 including asu 201608 and asu 201612 assumed the deferred effective date enforced by asu 201514 early adoption of the revenue asus is permitted for annual periods and interim periods within beginning after december 15 2016 a reporting entity may apply the amendments in the revenue asus using either a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulativeeffect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption or full retrospective approach the company is evaluating the complete impact of the adoption of the revenue asus on january 1 2018 to its consolidated financial position and results of operations as the primary source of revenue for the company is generated through leasing arrangements which are excluded from the revenue asus the company expects that it will be impacted in its recognition of nonlease revenue such as certain resident fees in its ridea structures a portion of which are not generated through leasing arrangements and its recognition of real estate sale transactions under asu 201409 revenue recognition for real estate sales is largely based on the transfer of control versus continuing involvement under current guidance as a result the company generally expects that the new guidance will result in more transactions qualifying as sales of real estate and revenue being recognized at an earlier date than under current accounting guidance  		 		 			reclassifications 		 		 			certain amounts in the companys

impairments 		 		 			in june 2015 and september 2015 the company determined that its four seasons notes see note 10 were otherthantemporarily impaired resulting from a continued decrease in the fair value of its investment although the company does not intend to sell and does not believe it will be required to sell the four seasons notes before their maturity the company determined that a credit loss existed resulting from several factors including i deterioration in four seasons operating performance since the fourth quarter of 2014 and ii credit downgrades to four seasons received during the first half of 2015 accordingly the company recorded impairment charges during the three months ended june 30 2015 and september 30 2015 of 42 million and 70 million respectively reducing the carrying value of the four seasons notes at september 30 2015 to 100 million 66 million  		 		 			the fair value of the four seasons notes used to calculate the impairment charge was based on quoted market prices however because the four seasons notes are not actively traded these prices are considered to be level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy when calculating the fair value and

flows the estimated future cash flow inputs included forecasted revenues capital expenditures operating expenses care home occupancy and continued implementation of four seasons business plan which includes executing on its business line segmentation and continuing to invest in its core real estate portfolio this information was consistent with the results of the valuation technique used by the company to determine if a credit loss existed and to calculate the fair value of the four seasons notes during its impairment review 		 		 			in june 2015 the company determined a mob was impaired and
