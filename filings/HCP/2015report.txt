		 		 		  		 			3 		   		 			table of contents 		  		  		 		 			business strategy  		 		 			we invest and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize the benefit to our shareholders and support the growth of our dividends the core elements of our strategy are i to acquire develop lease own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across multiple business segments and geographic locations including europe ii to align ourselves with leading healthcare companies operators and service providers which over the longterm should result in higher relative rental rates net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values iii to concentrate on longerterm escalating triplenet leases with highquality tenants while using ridea structures for properties that have higher growth potential iv to maintain adequate liquidity with longterm fixed rate debt financing with staggered maturities which supports the longerterm nature of our investments while reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk at any point in the interest rate or credit cycles and v to continue to manage our balance sheet with a targeted financial leverage of 40 relative to our assets 		 		 			internal growth strategies 		 		 			we believe that our longerterm escalating triplenet leases with financially strong tenants and operators enhance the quality stability and growth of our rental income further we believe many of our existing properties hold the potential for increased future cash flows as they are of high quality and in desirable locations within markets where the creation of new supply is limited by the lack of available sites and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary licensing other approvals andor financing our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties  		 		 			we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			build and maintain longterm leasing and management relationships with quality tenants and operators in choosing locations for our properties we focus our attention on their physical environment adjacency to established businesses eg hospital systems and educational centers proximity to sources of business growth and other local demographic factors 		 			 				  			 		 			 			replace tenants and operators quickly at the best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs we believe that we are wellpositioned to attract new tenants and operators and achieve attractive rental rates and operating cash flow as a result of the location design and maintenance of our properties together with our reputation for highquality building services and responsiveness to tenants and our ability to offer space alternatives within our portfolios 		 			 				  			 		 			 			extend and modify terms of existing leases prior to expiration we structure lease extensions early renewals or modifications which reduce the cost associated with lease downtime or the reinvestment risk resulting from the exercise of tenants purchase options while securing the tenancy andor relationship of our high quality tenants and operators on a longterm basis 		 			investment strategies 		 		 			the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector 		 		 			while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be

		 			overview 		 		 			our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care licensure and certificate of need government reimbursement fraud and abuse practices and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws regulations reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under item 1a risk factors in this report 		 		 			based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators excluding our medical office segment at december 31 2014 we estimate that approximately 15 and 14 of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement respectively 		 		 			the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 		 		 			fraud and abuse enforcement 		 		 			there are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs ii federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the stark law which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v federal and state privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 commonly referred to as hipaa which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions many of our tenants and operators are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws 		 		 		 		  		 			10 		   		 			table of contents 		  		reimbursement  		 		 			sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare programs and state medicaid programs and nongovernmental thirdparty payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government and many states face significant current and future budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations aco and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants and operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations 		 		 			healthcare licensure and certificate of need 		 		 			certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants and operators abilities to expand or change their businesses 		 		 			life science facilities 		 		 			while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 		 		 			senior housing entrance fee communities 		 		 			certain of our senior housing facilities are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facilitys financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 		 		 			americans with disabilities act the ada 		 		 			our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 		 		 			environmental matters 		 		 			a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore  		 		  		 			11 		   		 			table of contents 		  		could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our earnings for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see item 1a

adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			as set forth below we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following categories 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to our business and operations 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to our capital structure and market conditions  		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to other events and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to tax including reitrelated risks 		 			  		 		 			risks related to our business 		 		 			we depend on a limited number of operators and tenants that account for a large percentage of our revenues 		 		 			during the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 40 of our revenues were generated by our leasing or financial arrangements with the following two companies hcrmc 26 and brookdale 14 the inability or other failure of these tenants or operators to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay cause our stock price to decline and have other materially adverse effects on our business results of operations and

may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to third party tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or operator or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be recharacterized as a financing agreement in which case our rights and remedies as a lender compared to a landlord generally would be more limited 		 		 			also if a debtormanager seeks bankruptcy protection the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case in any of these events we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant operator or manager furthermore many of our facilities are leased to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may involve specific procedural requirements and may not be successful

contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in cross default under our other indebtedness although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of an applicable tenant or operator may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other materially adverse consequences 		 		 			increased competition has resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our tenants and operators and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 		 		 			the healthcare industry is highly competitive the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area  		 		 			our tenants and operators also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers such competition which is due in part to historical over development in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that the tenants and operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants and operators thus our tenants and operators may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets andor increasing our collection and dispute costs 		 		 		 		  		 			14

operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to

addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their

tenants and operators for example many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with selfinsurance trusts or captive programs that may provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities may underestimate the future cost of claims and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry however we cannot provide any assurances that we will continue to require the same level of insurance coverage of our tenants and operators or that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future also we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses or losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 		 		 			our tenants and operators face litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs 		 		 			in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the tenants and operators of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients has resulted in large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants and operators for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a

continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our operators and tenants costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our tenants or operators to comply with these laws and

and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults resulting from the breach of any of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			an increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell assets and conduct acquisition investment and development activities 		 		 			if interest rates increase so could our interest costs for any new debt this increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 		 		 			we manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and through the use of derivative instruments primarily interest rate swap agreements however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates swap agreements involve risk including that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be  		 		  		 			21 		   		 			table of contents 		  		limited by federal tax provisions governing reits and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than would otherwise be the case failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk if we choose to engage in such activities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 		 		 			we continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the denominated currency the ownership of investments located outside of the united states subjects us to risk from fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the british pound or other currencies in countries where we have a significant investment may have a materially adverse effect on our financial position debt covenant ratios results of operations and cash flow 		 		 			we may attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of derivative contracts or other methods for example as of january 30 2015 we have 492 million in debt investments and maintain an equal amount of unsecured gbp denominated debt as a natural hedge additionally we executed currency swap contracts to hedge the risk related to a portion of the forecasted interest receipts on these investments however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the failure to hedge effectively against foreign currency exchange rate risk if we choose to engage in such activities could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit

unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us generally or with respect to certain transactions from this statute in the future the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons 		 		 			in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the maryland business combination act our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in certain circumstances business combinations including a merger or consolidation and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities with a related person including a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding voting stock 		 		 			the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law and contained in our charter may delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such

financial officer chief investment officer and general counsel have employment agreements with us we cannot assure you that they will remain employed with us the loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock 		 		 			we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in a significant loss of the capital invested in a property lower than expected future revenues or unanticipated expense 		 		 			we maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we regularly review our insurance coverage however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters and may be subject to other losses in particular our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity while we purchase insurance coverage for earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analyses prepared by outside consultants there is no assurance that such insurance will fully cover such losses these losses can result in decreased anticipated revenues from a property and the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property following these events we may remain liable for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future in addition there are certain exposures for which we do not purchase insurance because we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market 		 		 			environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated

current or previous owner of real estate to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination the costs of cleanup and remediation could be substantial in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination 		 		 			although we currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount that we believe is commercially reasonable and generally require our tenants and operators to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property as the owner of a site we may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site including the release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us the cost of defending against these claims complying with environmental regulatory requirements conducting remediation of any contaminated property or paying personal injury or other claims or fines could be substantial and could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to use sell or lease the

and would have materially adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock 		 		 			qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 		 		 			if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we will be subject to corporatelevel income tax including any applicable

we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a reit 		 			as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 		 		 			the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with reits constantly are under review by persons involved in the legislative process the us  		 		  		 			24 		   		 			table of contents 		  		internal revenue service the irs and the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments and affect the tax considerations of an investment in us 		 		 			we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 		 		 			if during the tenyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize a gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 		 		 			in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any 		 		 			there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits eampp in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute eampp 		 		 			in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit eampp of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such eampp distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such eampp distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such eampp distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of eampp including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit eampp moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit eampp which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 		 		 			thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit eampp by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our eampp we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so 		 		 			our international expansion may result in additional taxrelated risks 		 		 			we have recently expanded our

identify our spp as stabilized properties that remained in operations and were consistently reported as leased properties or ridea properties for the duration of the yearoveryear comparison periods presented accordingly it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure to be included in our spp newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup typically when the tenants controls the physical use of at least 80 of the space or 12 months from the acquisition date newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service spp noi excludes certain nonproperty specific operating expenses that

and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 		 		 			ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit is net income applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and dfl depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income we compute ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition however other reits may report ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours  		 		 			in addition we present ffo before the impact of severancerelated charges litigation settlement charges preferred stock redemption charges impairments recoveries of nondepreciable assets and transactionrelated items defined below ffo as adjusted transactionrelated items include acquisition and pursuit costs eg due diligence and closing and gainscharges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo runrate this measure is a modification of the nareit definition of ffo and should not be used as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap or nareit ffo 		 		 			funds available for distribution  		 		 			fad is defined as ffo as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following i amortization of acquired market

deferred revenues effective 2014 excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements ownedrecognized by us and upfront cash payments made by tenants to

entrance fees other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating fad and accordingly our fad may not be comparable to those reported by other reits although our fad computation may not be comparable to that of other reits management believes fad provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our ability to fund our ongoing dividend payments in addition management believes that in order to further understand and analyze our liquidity fad should not be compared with net cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap and presented in our consolidated financial statements fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and fad should not be considered as an alternative to net

increased primarily as a result of annual rent escalations from our hcrmc dfl investments 		 		 			hcrmc equity method and dfl investments  on december 19 2014 we concluded that our 94 equity ownership interest in hcrmc was otherthantemporarily impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of 36 million or 008 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014 the impairment charge reduced the carrying amount of our equity investment in hcrmc to 39 million we made this conclusion principally based on the receipt and review of hcrmcs preliminary base financial forecast for 2015 together with hcrmcs yeartodate operating results through november 2014 hcrmcs preliminary base financial forecast and operating results primarily reflected a continued shift in patient payor sources from medicare to medicare advantage which negatively impacts reimbursement rates and length of stay for hcrmcs skilled nursing segment hcrmc has indicated that its 2015 preliminary base financial forecast does not include the effect of any dispositions acquisitions or other initiatives hcrmc may undertake to improve financial performance in 2015  		 		 			we believe that hcrmcs trailing twelvemonth fixed charge coverage tfcc ratio may continue to deteriorate over the next several quarters hcrmcs 2015 preliminary base financial forecast implies that the tfcc ratio is projected to decline to 107x at the end of 2015 compared to the tfcc ratio of 108x at the end of 2014 before the impact of 24 million of certain general and professional liability charges that hcrmc incurred in the second quarter of 2014 as noted above the tfcc ratio is calculated using hcrmcs 2015 preliminary base financial forecast that does not include the effects of any dispositions acquisitions or other initiatives hcrmc may undertake to improve financial performance in 2015  		 		 			notwithstanding these developments hcrmcs 2015 preliminary base financial forecast also indicates that hcrmc will continue to meet its contractual obligations to us under a master lease the master lease therefore we continue to believe that the collection and timing of all amounts owed by hcrmc under our master lease are reasonably assured hcrmc believes that it is favorably positioned to grow as part of the ongoing changes in the healthcare environment  		 		  		 			41 		   		 			table of contents 		  		based on discussions with the management of hcrmc and our evaluation of other industry data we note the following factors that influenced our evaluation of hcrmc i medicare rate increases of 17 and 14 took effect on october 1 2014 for the skilled nursing and hospice businesses respectively ii additional cost cutting measures were implemented in the fourth quarter of 2014 iii new facility developments and expansions will be operational in 2015 iv assisted living and hospice operations demonstrated continued growth v hcp and hcr manorcare have jointly agreed to market for sale certain nonstrategic assets that are under the master lease the purpose of the dispositions is to increase ebitdar reduce rent and improve hcrmcs tfcc however no assurances can be given that the facilities will be sold or as to the timing of the sales and vi hospital admissions are forecasted to improve in 2015 		 		 			while we remain confident in hcrmcs ongoing adjustments to their business model hcrmc has not been able to reverse the decline in their financial performance failure of hcrmc to reverse the decline in its financial performance may lead us to conclude that the collection and timing of contractual obligations or a portion thereof under the master lease may not be reasonably assured in which case we would place the hcrmc dfl or a portion thereof on nonaccrual status if we further determine that it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due under the terms of the master lease we may incur an impairment on our hcrmc dfl or a portion thereof 		 		 			life science

			inflation 		 		 			our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants operating revenues most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the tenant or operator expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 		 		 			critical accounting policies 		 		 			the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			58 		   		 			table of contents 		  		  		 		 			principles of consolidation 		 		 			the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 		 		 			we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entitys governing body the size and seniority of our investment our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a reanalysis of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the variable interest entity our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 		 		 			if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie either tenant or borrower rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie we would require the vie to provide us timely financial information and would review the internal control of the vie to determine if we could rely on the financial information they provide if the vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting 		 		 			revenue recognition 		 		 			at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying propertys economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs are equal to 90 or more of the excess estimated fair value over retained tax credits of the leased building if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predicable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease if the assumptions utilized in the above classification assessments were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 		 		 			certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to  		 		  		 			59 		   		 			table of contents 		  		make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for operating lease straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable for leases accounted for as dfls the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured investments in dfls are presented net of unamortized unearned income the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment if these assessments were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 		 		 			loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans if management determined that certain loans should no longer be classified as held for maturity the timing and amount of our interest income recognized would be impacted 		 		 			loans and dfls are placed on nonaccrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured while on nonaccrual status loans and dfls are either accounted for on a cash basis in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash or on a costrecovery basis were cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or dfl based on managements judgment of collectibility  		 		 			allowances are established for loans and dfls based upon an estimate of probable losses on an individual basis if they are determined to be impaired loans and dfls are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrowers or lessees overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the performance of our tenants operators or borrowers the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans or dfls effective interest rate the fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors while our assumptions are based in part upon historical data our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements  		 		 			real estate 		 		 			we make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component the most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the value of inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases 		 		 		 		  		 			60 		   		 			table of contents 		  		a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 		 		 			impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 		 		 			we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be recoverable recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 		 		 			goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually based on certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount potential impairment indicators and qualitative factors include a significant decline in real estate valuations restructuring plans current macroeconomic conditions state of the equity and capital markets or a significant decline in the value of our market capitalization if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we apply the required twostep quantitative approach the quantitative procedures of the twostep approach i compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill and if necessary ii compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment if any we estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques including applying capitalization rates to segment net operating income quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals as necessary the fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company 		 		 			the determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results resulting cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 		 		 			investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 		 		 			the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment indicators based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of the fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 		 		 		 		  		 			61 		   		 			table of contents

derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements 		 		 			to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 4 million see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis details 		 		 			interest rate risk 		 		 			at december 31 2014 we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates primarily on variable rate investments which have been predominately hedged through interest rate swap contracts 		 		 			interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate investments and variablerate debt and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2014 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 9 million or 002 per common share on a diluted basis 		 		 			  		 		 			foreign currency exchange rate risk 		 		 			at

recoveries and income from dfls 		 			 				 2 			 		 			 			noi and adjusted noi are nongaap supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate the company defines noi as rental and related revenues including tenant recoveries resident fees and services and income from dfls less property level operating expense noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income as presented below the company believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline rents dfl accretion amortization of market lease intangibles and lease termination fees adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as cash noi the company uses noi  		 		  		 			95 		   		 			table of contents 		  		and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property level performance the company believes that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by gaap because it does not reflect various excluded items further the companys definition of noi may not be comparable to the definition used by other reits or real estate companies as those companies may use different methodologies for calculating noi 		 			  		 		 			the following is a reconciliation from reported net income to noi and
