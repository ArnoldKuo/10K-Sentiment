a selfadministered reit that together with our unconsolidated joint ventures invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the us we acquire develop lease manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers at december 31 2013 our portfolio of investments including properties owned by our investment management platform consisted of interests in 1153 facilities  39      table of contents  our business strategy is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing we actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential or shorter investment horizons into assets representing longer term investments with attractive riskadjusted return potential we make investments where the expected riskadjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to capitalize on our operator tenant and other business relationships to grow our business   our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on terms that are favorable to us generally we prefer larger more complex private transactions that leverage our management teams experience and our infrastructure we follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio including ongoing evaluation of potential disposition of properties that no longer fit our strategy   we primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare properties under longterm leases with fixed andor inflation indexed escalators most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triplenet leases or leases that provide for substantial recovery of operating expenses however some of our medical office and life science leases are structured as gross or modified gross leases operating expenses are generally related to mobs and life science leased properties and senior housing properties managed by eligible independent contractors on our behalf ridea properties accordingly for such mobs life science facilities and ridea properties we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities employee costs for resident care and insurance our growth for these assets depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels ii maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures and iii control operating and other expenses our operations are impacted by property specific market specific general economic and other conditions at december 31 2013 the contractual maturities in our portfolio of leased assets were 17 through 2017 measured in dollars of expiring base rents   access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy   2013 transaction overview   investment transactions   during the year ended december 31 2013 we made investments of 598 million which included the following   on may 2 2013 we acquired 121 million 188 million of barchester healthcare barchester debt investments at a discount for 109 million 170 million on august 23 2013 we acquired an additional investment in this loan of 9 million 14 million at a discount for 5 million 8 million on september 6 2013 we received 129 million 202 million from the par payoff of our barchester debt investments resulting in interest income of 24 million primarily from the unamortized discounts   on june 25 2013 we funded the 102 million second tranche of our 2012 mezzanine loan facility to tandem health care an affiliate of formation capital as part of the recapitalization of a postacuteskilled nursing portfolio the funds from the second tranche were used to repay debt senior to our loan the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 12 and 14 per annum for the first and second transactions respectively the facility will have a total term of up to 63 months from the initial closing in july 2012 the mezzanine loan facility is subordinate to 443 million of senior mortgage debt   40      table of contents   in march 2013 we acquired the four remaining senior housing facilities from our previously announced 2012 blackstone jv acquisition for 38 million  we funded 249 million to acquire a senior housing facility and marketable debt securities and to fund construction and other capital projects primarily in our life science medical office and senior housing segments    during the year ended december 31 2013 we sold 12 properties for 96 million in addition in september 2013 we exchanged a 62bed hospital located in greenfield wisconsin for a 60bed hospital located in webster texas   financing activities   during the year ended december 31 2013 we repaid 810 million of aggregate senior unsecured and mortgage debt notes with a weighted average interest rate of 57   on november 12 2013 we issued 800 million of 425 senior unsecured notes due in 2023 the notes were priced at 9954 of the principal amount with an effective yieldtomaturity of 4307 net proceeds from this offering were 789 million   dividends   quarterly dividends paid during 2013 aggregated 210 per share which represents a 5 increase from 2012 on january 30 2014 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0545 per common share the annualized distribution rate per share for 2014 increased 38 to 218 compared to 210 for 2013 the dividend will be paid on february 25 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 10 2014   critical accounting policies   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain    principles of consolidation    the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic  41      table of contents performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie   we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entitys governing body the size and seniority of our investment our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the variable interest entity our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary   if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie either tenant or borrower rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie we would require the vie to provide us timely financial information and would review the internal control of the vie to determine if we could rely on the financial information they provide if the vie has deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting    revenue recognition    at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying propertys economic life or iv the future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs are equal to 90 or more of the excess estimated fair value over retained tax credits of the leased building if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predicable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease if the assumptions utilized in the above classification assessments were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our consolidated financial statements   we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset for assets acquired subject to leases we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken possession or control of the physical use of the leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements for accounting purposes are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes were different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted   certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when  42      table of contents actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements   we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for operating lease straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements   we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable for leases accounted for as dfls the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured investments in dfls are presented net of unamortized unearned income the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment if these assessments for accounting purposes were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted   loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans   loans and dfls are placed on nonaccrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured while on nonaccrual status loans and dfls are either accounted for on a cash basis in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash or on a costrecovery basis were cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or dfl based on managements judgment of collectibility   allowances are established for loans and dfls based upon an estimate of probable losses on an individual basis if they are determined to be impaired loans and dfls are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrowers or lessees overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans or dfls effective interest rate the fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors while our assumptions are based in part upon historical data our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements  43      table of contents   real estate    we make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component the most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the value of inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases   a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements    impairment of longlived assets and goodwill    we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be recoverable recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset   goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually based on certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount potential impairment indicators and qualitative factors include a significant decline in real estate valuations restructuring plans current macroeconomic conditions state of the equity and capital markets or a significant decline in the value of our market capitalization if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we apply the required twostep quantitative approach the quantitative procedures of the twostep approach i compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill and if necessary ii compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment if any we estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques including applying capitalization rates to segment net operating income quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals as necessary the fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company  44      table of contents  the determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results resulting cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results    investments in unconsolidated joint ventures    investments in entities which we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting our share of the investees earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations   the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment indicators based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of the fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results    income taxes    as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii recognition of builtin gain associated with prior taxfree acquisitions of c corporations and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision   results of operations   we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments i senior housing ii postacuteskilled nursing iii life science iv medical office and v hospital under the senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital segments we invest or coinvest primarily in single operator or tenant properties through the acquisition and development of real estate management of operations ridea and by debt issued by operators in these sectors under the medical office segment we invest or coinvest through the acquisition and development of mobs that are leased under gross modified gross or triplenet leases generally to multiple tenants and which generally require a greater level of property management the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  45      table of contents  we use net operating income from continuing operations noi and adjusted noi to assess and compare property level performance including our same property portfolio spp and to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property level performance we believe these measures provide investors relevant and useful information because they reflect only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and present them on an unleveraged basis we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by gaap since noi excludes certain components from net income further noi may not be comparable to that of other reits or real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional segment information and the relevant reconciliations from net income to noi and adjusted noi   operating expenses are generally related to mob and life science leased properties and senior housing properties managed by eligible independent contractors on our behalf ridea properties we generally recover all or a portion of mob and life science expenses from the tenants tenant recoveries the presentation of expenses as operating or general and administrative is based on the underlying nature of the expense periodically we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expenses   our evaluation of results of operations by each business segment includes an analysis of our spp and our total property portfolio spp information allows us to evaluate the performance of our leased property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties we identify our spp as stabilized properties that remained in operations and were consistently reported as leased properties or ridea properties for the duration of the yearoveryear comparison periods presented accordingly it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure to be included in our spp newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup typically when the tenants controls the physical use of at least 80 of the space or 12 months from the acquisition date newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service spp noi excludes certain nonproperty specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis   comparison of the year ended december 31 2013 to the year ended december 31 2012   during the fourth quarter of 2012 and first quarter of 2013 we acquired a portfolio of 133 senior housing communities from the blackstone jv see additional information in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements the transaction closed in two stages i 129 senior housing facilities during the fourth quarter of 2012 for 17 billion and ii four senior housing facilities during the first quarter of 2013 for 38 million the results of operations from the acquisitions are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from those respective dates    segment noi and adjusted noi    the tables below provide selected operating information for our spp

swapped rates   depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expenses increased 8 million to 354 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the increase was primarily the result of additive effects of our acquisitions during 2011 and 2012   general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased 17 million to 79 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the decrease was primarily due to an insurance recovery of 7 million during 2012 for previously incurred legal expenses and a decrease of 8 million in acquisition costs incurred during 2012 compared to similar costs incurred during 2011   litigation settlement and provision on november 9 2011 we entered into an agreement with ventas to settle all remaining claims relating to ventass litigation against us arising out of ventass 2007 acquisition of sunrise senior living reit as part of the settlement we paid 125 million to ventas which resulted in a charge for the same amount see the information set forth under the heading legal proceedings of note 12 to the consolidated financial statements no similar charges were recognized during the year ended december 31 2012   impairments during the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized an impairment of 8 million as a result of the disposition of a life science land parcel see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information during the year ended december 31 2011 we recognized an impairment of 15 million related to a senior secured term loan as a result of concluding that the carrying value of the loan was in excess of the fair value of the related collateral supporting the loan see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information  59      table of contents  other income net for the year ended december 31 2012 other income net decreased 10 million to 3 million the decrease was primarily the result of a gain of 8 million resulting from our acquisition of our partners 65 interest in and consolidation of hcp ventures ii in january 2011 see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information and 6 million received in connection with a litigation settlement in june 2011 that represents proceeds owed to us from a prior sale of assets no similar gain upon consolidation was recognized or settlements were received during the year ended december 31 2012 the decreases were partially offset by a 5 million charge during the year ended december 31 2011 for an otherthantemporary impairment of marketable equity securities   income taxes for the year ended december 31 2012 income taxes decreased 3 million to a benefit of 2 million the decrease in income taxes was primarily due to the tax benefit resulting from declines in taxable income of our trs entities during the year ended december 31 2012   equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily the result of our equity interest in hcr manorcare the october 2011 cms reduction of skilled nursing reimbursements under resource utilization groupversion 4 rugsiv together with changes in requirements for the delivery of group therapy services reduced hcr manorcares revenues and increased its therapy costs in 2012 hcr manorcare partially mitigated these adverse impacts through a cost reduction program further hcr manorcare experienced increased exposure to general and professional liability claims resulting in higher charges in 2012 which together with the circumstances discussed above reduced our share in the earnings from our equity interest in hcr manorcare   during the year ended december 31 2012 equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased 8 million to 54 million this increase primarily was the result of the fullyear share of earnings from our interest in hcr manorcare inc compared to a partialyear in 2011 see notes 3 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information our share of earnings from hcr manorcare equity income increases for the corresponding reduction of related lease expense recognized at the hcr manorcare level   discontinued operations income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2012 was 46 million compared to 18 million for the comparable period in 2011 the increase is primarily due to an increase in gains on real estate dispositions of 28 million partially offset by a decline in operating income from discontinued operations of 1 million during the year ended december 31 2012 we sold real estate investments for 151 million compared to 19 million for the year ended december 31 2011   liquidity and capital resources   our principal liquidity needs are to i fund recurring operating expenses ii meet debt service requirements including 487 million of senior unsecured notes and 180 million of mortgage debt principal payments and maturities in 2014 iii fund capital expenditures including tenant improvements and leasing costs iv fund acquisition and development activities and v make dividend distributions we anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next 12 months will be adequate to fund our business operations debt service payments recurring capital expenditures and cash dividends to stockholders capital requirements relating to maturing indebtedness acquisitions development and redevelopment activities may require funding from borrowings andor equity and debt offerings   access to capital markets impacts our cost

billion for the year ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of the following i the impact of our investments in 2012 and 2013 ii assets placed in service during 2012 and 2013 and iii rent escalations and resets in 2012 and 2013 which increases were partially offset by increased debt interest payments our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multitenant buildings rental rates on leases our tenants performance on their lease obligations the level of operating expenses and other factors   the following are significant investing and financing activities for the year ended december 31 2013   made investments of 223 million loans development and acquisition of real estate net of loan

december 31 2013 fouryear unsecured term loan the term loan that accrues interest at a rate of gbp libor plus 120 based on our current debt ratings concurrent with the closing of the term loan we entered into a fouryear interest rate swap contract that fixes the rate of the term loan at 181 subject to adjustments based on our debt ratings the term loan contains a oneyear committed extension option the term loan was used to finance the purchase of our gbp denominated senior unsecured notes see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information   the facility and term loan contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements among other things these covenants using terms defined in the agreements i limit the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total asset value to 60 ii limit the ratio of secured debt to consolidated total asset value to 30 iii limit the ratio of unsecured debt to consolidated unencumbered asset value to 60 iv require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 15 times and v require a formuladetermined minimum consolidated tangible net worth of 92 billion at december 31 2013 at december 31 2013 we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the facility and term loan  61      table of contents  our facility also contains crossdefault provisions to other indebtedness of ours including in some instances certain mortgages on our properties certain mortgages contain default provisions relating to defaults under the leases or operating agreements on the applicable properties by our operators or tenants including default provisions relating to the bankruptcy filings of such operator or tenant although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements if a default as described above occurs such a default may result in significantly less favorable borrowing terms than currently available material delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences   senior unsecured notes at december 31 2013 we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of 70 billion interest rates on the notes ranged from 121 to 698 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 497 and a weighted average maturity of six years at december 31 2013 the senior unsecured

debt typically restricts transfer of the encumbered assets prohibits additional liens restricts prepayment requires payment of real estate taxes requires maintenance of the assets in good condition requires maintenance of insurance on the assets and includes conditions to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases some of the mortgage debt is also crosscollateralized by multiple assets and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such real estate assets   other debt at december 31 2013 we had 75 million of noninterest bearing life care bonds at two of our continuing care retirement communities and noninterest bearing occupancy fee deposits at two of our senior housing facilities all of which

believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and basic and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue   ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit is net income applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from acquisition and dispositions of depreciable real estate or related interests impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and dfl depreciation and amortization with adjustments for joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income we compute ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition however other reits may report ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours in addition we present ffo before the impact of severancerelated charges litigation settlement charges preferred stock redemption charges impairments recoveries of nondepreciable assets and mergerrelated items defined below ffo as adjusted management believes ffo as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement this measure is a modification of the nareit

indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants operating revenues most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above   recent accounting pronouncements   see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards there were no accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us that we believe will materially impact our consolidated financial statements
