    we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information   to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates the estimated change  67      table of contents in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 6 million see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis details   interest rate risk at december 31 2013 we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on the following i properties with a gross value of 83 million that are subject to leases where the payments fluctuate with changes in libor that are partially offset by ii 25 million of variablerate senior unsecured notes and iii 9 million of variablerate mortgage debt payable excludes 72 million of variablerate mortgage notes that have been hedged through interestrate swap contracts  additionally our exposure to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates excludes our gbp denominated 227 million 137 million variablerate term loan that has been hedged through interestrate swap contracts   interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate investments and variablerate debt and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2013 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 1 million or less than 001 per common share on a diluted basis   foreign currency exchange rate risk at december 31 2013 our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates to forecasted interest receipts from our gbp denominated senior unsecured notes see additional discussion of the four seasons senior unsecured notes in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements our foreign currency exchange exposure is mitigated by the forecasted interest and principal payments from our gbp denominated unsecured term loan see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information and a foreign currency swap
