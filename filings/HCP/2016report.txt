to our stockholders and support the growth of our dividends the core elements of our strategy are i to acquire develop lease own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across multiple business segments and geographic locations including europe ii to align ourselves with leading healthcare companies operators and service providers which over the longterm should result in higher relative rental rates net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values iii to allocate capital targeting a balanced portfolio between longerterm escalating triplenet leases with highquality tenants and operating businesses with shorterterm leases in our medical office and life science segments iv to maintain adequate liquidity with longterm fixed rate debt financing with staggered maturities which supports the longerterm nature of our investments while reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk at any point in the interest rate or credit cycles and v to continue to manage our balance sheet with a targeted financial leverage of 40 relative to our assets 		 		 			internal growth strategies 		 		 			we believe that our longerterm escalating triplenet leases with larger tenants and operators having scale enhance the quality stability and growth of our rental income further we believe many of our existing properties hold the potential for increased future cash flows as they are well maintained and in desirable locations within markets where the creation of new supply is limited by the lack of available sites and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary licensing other approvals andor financing our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties  		 		 			we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			build and maintain longterm leasing and management relationships with quality tenants and operators in choosing locations for our properties we focus our attention on their physical environment adjacency to established businesses eg hospital systems and educational centers proximity to sources of business growth and other local demographic factors 		 			 				  			 		 			 			replace tenants and operators at the best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs we believe that we are wellpositioned to attract new tenants and operators and achieve attractive rental rates and operating cash flow as a result of the location design and maintenance of our properties together with our reputation for highquality building services and responsiveness to tenants and our ability to offer space alternatives within our portfolios 		 			 				  			 		 			 			extend and modify terms of existing leases prior to expiration we structure lease extensions early renewals or modifications which reduce the cost associated with lease downtime or the reinvestment risk resulting from the exercise of tenants purchase options while securing the tenancy and relationship of our high quality tenants and operators on a longterm basis 		 			investment strategies 		 		 			the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling longterm demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector 		 		 			while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited

licensure and certificate of need government reimbursement fraud and abuse practices and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws regulations reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under item 1a risk factors in this report 		 		 			based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators excluding our medical office segment at december 31 2015 we estimate that approximately 13 and 12 of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement respectively 		 		 			the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 		 		 			fraud and abuse enforcement 		 		 			there are various extremely complex us federal and state laws and regulations and in relation to our facilities located in the uk national laws and regulations of england scotland northern ireland and wales governing healthcare providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i us federal state false claims acts and uk antifraud legislation and regulation which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other us federal or state or uk healthcare programs ii us federal state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit or restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services and uk legislation and regulations on financial inducements and vested interests iii us federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the stark law which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v us federal state and uk privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 commonly referred to as hipaa and the uk data protection act 1988 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of us and uk healthcare fraud and abuse laws  		  		 			10 		   		 			table of contents 		 carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and in the us can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions many of our tenants and operators are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws 		 		 			reimbursement  		 		 			sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare programs and state medicaid programs and in the uk the national health service nhs and local authority funding and nongovernmental thirdparty payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government many states face significant current and future budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators similarly in the uk the nhs and the local authorities are undertaking efforts to reduce costs which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by our uk tenants and operators additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the us including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations aco and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants and operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations  		 		 			healthcare licensure and certificate of need 		 		 			certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio including our facilities located in the uk are subject to extensive national federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to handle controlled substances including narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states in the us require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants and operators abilities to expand or change their businesses 		 		 			life science facilities 		 		 			while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 		 		 			senior housing entrance fee communities 		 		 			certain of our senior housing facilities are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facilitys financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 		 		 			americans with disabilities act the ada 		 		 			our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make  		  		 			11 		   		 			table of contents 		 modifications as appropriate in this respect 		 		 			environmental matters 		 		 			a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets in

our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			as set forth below we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to our business and operations 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to our capital structure and market conditions  		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to other events and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to tax including reitrelated risks 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			risks related to our business and operations 		 		 			we depend on a limited number of tenants and operators for a large percentage of our revenues and net operating income 		 		 			we manage our facilities utilizing lease and ridea structures under our lease arrangements we generated 33 of our revenues from hcrmc 23 and brookdale 10 during the year ended december 31 2015 hcrmc is an operator that primarily provides postacute care skilled nursing care and assisted living services and relies heavily on government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 		 		 			in addition to our lease arrangement with brookdale under ridea structures we generated 8 of our net operating  		  		 			12 		   		 			table of contents 		 income from properties managed by brookdale during the year ended december 31 2015 services provided by our tenants or operators in facilities managed under a ridea structure are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs we report the resident level fees and services revenues and corresponding operating expenses in our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			the inability or other failure of either hcrmc under its lease agreements or brookdale under its lease agreements and ridea structures to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow net operating income and results of operations which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay to our stockholders cause our stock price to decline and have other materially adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			in addition any failure by hcrmc or brookdale to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition furthermore they each face an increasingly competitive labor market for skilled management personnel and nurses which can cause operating costs to increase while hcrmc and brookdale generally have also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses they may have insufficient assets income access to financing andor insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their indemnification obligations 		 		 			the real estate portfolio that we have master leased to hcrmc accounts for a significant portion of our assets and revenues adverse regulatory and operational developments in hcrmcs business and financial condition have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on us 		 		 			hcrmc a provider of a range of healthcare services primarily in postacute care skilled nursing care and assisted living is our largest tenant representing 23 of our gross assets and revenues as of and for the year ended december 31 2015 in april 2011 we completed a 6 billion acquisition of substantially all the real estate assets of and an equity interest in hcrmc in the first quarter 2015 we recorded an impairment charge of 478 million related to the real estate portfolio master leased to hcrmc based on the present value of the future lease payments under the amendment to the master lease with hcrmc that became effective april 1 2015 as a result of hcrmcs fourth quarter 2015 performance deterioration and related decline in fixed charge coverage we subsequently placed the real estate portfolio master leased to hcrmc on watch list status effective at yearend 2015 and changed our accounting treatment to recognize rental income on a cash basis beginning january 1 2016 furthermore hcrmcs preliminary 2016 forecast indicates only limited improvement in its fixed charge coverage and free cash flow after capital expenditures in 2016 accordingly we assessed the value of this real estate portfolio including obtaining an independent valuation appraisal of our postacuteskilled nursing and senior housing facilities as a result we reduced the carrying value of this real estate portfolio to 52 billion approximating its estimated market value which resulted in an impairment charge of 817 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015  		 		 			in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2015 we recorded impairment charges of 36 million and 27 million respectively for our equity ownership interest in hcrmc these impairment charges resulted primarily from our review of their 2015 preliminary base financial forecast operating results and other financial information provided by hcrmc as well as market and industry data that among other factors showed a declining trend in admissions from hospitals and continuing trends in mix and length of stay driven by medicare advantage and other managed care plans as a result of hcrmcs fourth quarter 2015 performance deterioration we recorded an additional impairment charge of 19 million for our equity ownership in hcrmc reducing its carrying value to zero 		 		 			on april 20 2015 the doj unsealed a previously filed complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia against hcrmc and certain of its affiliates in three consolidated cases following a civil investigation arising out of three lawsuits filed by former employees of hcrmc under the qui tam provisions of the federal false claims act the complaint alleges that hcrmc submitted claims to medicare for therapy services that were not covered by the skilled nursing facility benefit were not medically reasonable and necessary and were not skilled in nature and therefore not entitled to medicare reimbursement hcrmc incurred legal and regulatory defense costs of 3 million and 9 million during the fourth quarter and full year 2015 respectively while the doj litigation is at an early stage and hcrmc has indicated that it believes the claims are unjust and it will vigorously defend against them the ultimate outcome is uncertain and could among other things cause hcrmc to i incur substantial additional time and costs to respond to and defend  		  		 			13 		   		 			table of contents 		 hcrmcs actions in the litigation with the doj and any other thirdparty payors ii refund or adjust amounts previously paid for services under governmental programs and to change business operations going forward in a manner that negatively impacts future revenue iii pay substantial fines and penalties and incur other administrative sanctions including having to conduct future business operations pursuant to a corporate integrity agreement which may be with the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services iv lose the right to participate in the medicare or medicaid programs and v suffer damage to hcrmcs reputation in addition any settlement in the doj litigation with or without an admission of wrongdoing may include a substantial monetary component that could have a material adverse effect on hcrmcs liquidity and financial condition that makes it difficult or not possible for hcrmc to meet its obligations under its amended master lease with us 		 		 			continued deterioration in hcrmcs operating performance business or financial condition or adverse regulatory developments could further reduce the revenues we earn under our master lease with hcrmc further impair the value of our master lease with hcrmc and result in among other adverse events acceleration of hcrmcs indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code any one or a combination of which could have a materially adverse effect on us  		 		 			see additional information regarding the aforementioned impairment charges equity interest in hcrmc and master lease with

brookdale account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income adverse developments in brookdales business and affairs or financial condition could have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			as of december 31 2015 brookdale managed 108 senior housing facilities that we own and 15 ccrcs owned by our unconsolidated joint venture pursuant to longterm management agreements for the year ended december 31 2015 these properties represented 12 and 10 of our gross assets and revenues respectively although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements we rely on brookdales personnel expertise technical resources and information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively we also rely on brookdale to set appropriate resident fees to provide accurate propertylevel financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our senior housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations  		 		 			in its capacity as a manager brookdale does not lease our properties and therefore we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as a triplenet tenant however any adverse developments in brookdales business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a materially adverse effect on us brookdale is also one of our triplenet tenants if brookdale experiences any significant financial legal accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise such difficulties could result in among other adverse events acceleration of its indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major tenants operators or borrowers may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to third party tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties we are also a direct or indirect lender to various tenants and operators although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or operator or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the  		  		 			14 		   		 			table of contents 		 least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be recharacterized as a financing agreement in which case our rights and remedies as a lender compared to a landlord generally would be more limited 		 		 			also if a debtormanager seeks bankruptcy protection the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case in any of these events we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes insurance debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant operator or manager furthermore many of our facilities are leased to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may involve specific procedural requirements and may not be successful 		 		 			additionally the financial weakness or other inability of our tenants operators or borrowers to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in cross default under our other indebtedness although we may be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of an applicable tenant or operator may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other materially adverse consequences 		 		 			increased competition has resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our tenants operators and borrowers and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 		 		 			the healthcare industry is highly competitive the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area in addition our tenants operators and borrowers face an increasingly competitive labor market for skilled management personnel and nurses an inability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and nurses and other trained personnel could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures on wages may force tenants operators and borrowers to enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for skilled personnel or to use more expensive contract personnel but they be unable to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses or any failure by our tenants operators or borrowers to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our cash flow and have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			our tenants operators and borrowers also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers this competition which is due in part to over development in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that our tenants operators and borrowers will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels and to manage their expenses in a way that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants operators and borrowers they may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses or to manage their expenses either of which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets andor increasing our collection and dispute costs  		 		 			 		  		 			15 		   		 			table of contents 		 competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or to retain or attract tenants and operators 		 		 			we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities similarly our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators or may reduce the rents we are able to charge if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms or attract and retain profitable tenants and operators our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 		 		 			economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			for the year ended december 31 2015 35 of our revenue was derived from properties located in california 22 and texas 13 as a result we may be subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions increased competition or decreased demand changes in statespecific legislation and local climate events and natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires and hurricanes which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 		 		 			we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other tenants and operators 		 		 			healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific a new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property depending on that tenants or operators particular business if a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent andor vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators these expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			we face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken 		 		 			property development is a component of our growth strategy at december 31 2015 our actual investment and estimated commitments under our development platform including land held for redevelopment represented approximately 721 million or 3 of our total assets largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred 		 			 				  			 		 			 			the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and higher materials transportation labor leasing or other costs which could make the completion of the development project less profitable 		 			 				  			 		 			 			construction andor permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 		 			 				  			 		 			 			the project may not be completed on schedule as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters labor conditions material shortages regulatory hurdles civil unrest and acts of war which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses or provide tenants or operators with the right to terminate preconstruction leases and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to  		  		 			16 		   		 			table of contents 		 make the property profitable  		 			any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments 		 		 			we have and may continue in the future to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decisionmaking authority which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes including litigation or arbitration 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives including the timing terms and strategies for any investments 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest and risk to our reit status 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners might become bankrupt fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues 		 			any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			from time to time we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 		 		 			acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities including 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			liabilities relating to the cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions 		 			 				  			 		 			 			unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller 		 			 				  			 		 			 			liabilities claims and litigation whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business relating to periods prior to our acquisition 		 			 				  			 		 			 			claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the seller and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition 		 			in addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			 		  		 			17 		   		 			table of contents 		 from time to time we have made and in the future we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds 		 		 			we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value future acquisitions may require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures each of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 		 		 			our tenants operators and borrowers face litigation and may continue to experience rising liability and insurance costs 		 		 			in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the tenants and operators of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients has resulted in large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants operators and borrowers for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our tenants and operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance or cause our borrowers to be unable to meet their obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits arising from the alleged actions of our tenants or operators for which claims such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify us but which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part 		 		 			the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants operators and borrowers ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 		 		 			certain of our tenants operators and borrowers are affected directly or indirectly by an extremely complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations pertaining to governmental reimbursement programs such laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes that are sometimes applied retroactively see item 1businessgovernment regulation licensing and enforcement above for example to the extent that any of our tenants or operators receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			statutory and regulatory changes 		 			 				  			 		 			 			retroactive rate adjustments 		 			 				  			 		 			 			recovery of program overpayments or setoffs 		 			 				  			 		 			 			court decisions 		 			 				  			 		 			 			administrative rulings 		 			 				  			 		 			 			policy interpretations 		 			 				  			 		 			 			payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers 		 			 				  			 		 			 			government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such properties 		 			if our tenants operators or borrowers directly or indirectly fail to comply with the extensive laws regulations and other requirements applicable to their business and the operation of our properties they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental reimbursement programs face bans on admissions of new patients or residents suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations these laws and regulations are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions for  		  		 			18 		   		 			table of contents 		 example one of our borrowers tandem health care has an operator of its facilities consulate health care consulate facing a qui tam or whistleblower action alleging that consulate overbilled the federal government and the state of florida our tenants operators and borrowers could be adversely affected by the resources required to respond to an investigation or other enforcement action in such event the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants and the results of operations of our properties operated by those entities could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us we are unable to predict future federal state and local regulations and legislation including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to budgetary pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our tenants operators and borrowers costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our tenants operators or borrowers to comply with these laws and regulations and significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 		 		 			legislation to address federal government operations and administration decisions affecting the centers for medicare and medicaid services could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants operators and borrowers liquidity financial condition or results of operations 		 		 			congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to the federal debt ceiling the affordable care act as defined below tax reform and entitlement programs including reimbursement rates for physicians could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants operators and borrowers liquidity financial condition or results of operations in particular changes in funding for entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid may result in increased costs and fees for programs such as medicare advantage plans and additional reductions in reimbursements to providers additionally amendments to the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the affordable care act implementation of the affordable care act and decisions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services could impact the delivery of services and benefits under medicare medicaid or medicare advantage plans and could affect our tenants and operators and the manner in which they are reimbursed by such programs such changes could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants operators and borrowers liquidity financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			furthermore the supreme courts decision upholding the constitutionality of the individual healthcare mandate while striking down the provisions linking federal funding of state medicaid programs with a federally mandated expansion of those programs has contributed to the uncertainty regarding the impact that the law will have on healthcare delivery systems over the next decade we can expect that federal authorities will continue to implement the law but because of the supreme courts mixed ruling the implementation will take longer than originally expected with a commensurate increase in the period of uncertainty regarding the longterm financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare 		 		 			tenants and operators that fail to comply with federal state local and international laws and regulations including licensure certification and inspection requirements may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 		 		 			our tenants operators and borrowers are subject to or impacted by extensive frequently changing federal state local and international laws and regulations these laws and regulations include among others laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their operations such as fire health and safety laws and privacy laws federal and state laws affecting hospitals clinics and other healthcare communities that participate in both medicare and medicaid that mandate allowable costs pricing reimbursement procedures and limitations quality of services and care food service and physical plants and similar foreign laws regulating the healthcare industry resident rights laws including abuse and neglect laws and fraud laws antikickback and physician referral laws the ada and similar state and local laws and safety and health standards set by the occupational safety and health administration or similar foreign agencies certain of our properties may also require a license registration andor certificate of need to operate  		 		 			 		  		 			19 		   		 			table of contents 		 our tenants operators or borrowers failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from government healthcare programs loss of license or

therefore may materially adversely impact us see item 1businessgovernment regulation licensing and enforcementhealthcare licensure and certificate of need above 		 		 			our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty 		 		 			life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to

materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate occupy or reposition the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 		 		 			if a tenant or operator defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the propertys investment potential in some cases the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating facilities and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity tenants operators or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure and we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may

not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding

complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such eampp distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of eampp including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit eampp moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit eampp which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 		 		 			thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit eampp by the close of the

operating performance before the impact from nonroutine items described below hcrmcs fourth quarter ebitdar was below its forecast primarily due to the continued change in payor mix from traditional

disposition assets with fourth quarter census decreasing 175 basis points from the prior year to 826 		 		 			nonroutine items as discussed below hcrmc is in the process of exiting 50 nonstrategic assets of which 21 sales were completed in the fourth quarter and an additional 11 closed in the first quarter 2016 as such disruption resulting from transitioning operations to new owners and closing costs led to additional underperformance from this pool of assets ebitdar losses from the sale of nonstrategic assets totaled 11 million in the fourth quarter 2015 and 22 million for full year 2015 hcp continues to expect total proceeds of 350 million from the sales of the nonstrategic assets of which 280 million have closed todate with the remaining 70 million expected to close in mid2016

resulting from the appreciation of the underlying real estate assets and iii additional fundings under our mezzanine loan facility with tandem in may 2015 see note 7 to the consolidated financial

critical accounting policies 		 		 			the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 		 		 			  		 		 			principles of consolidation 		 		 			the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 		 		 			we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support or iii substantially all of the entitys activities involve or are performed on behalf of an equity investor that holds disproportionately few voting rights we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entitys governing body the size and seniority of our investment and our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a reanalysis of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the vie our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 		 		 			if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie we would require the vie to provide us timely financial information and would review the internal controls of the vie to determine if we could rely on the financial information it provides if the vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting 		 		 			revenue recognition 		 		 			at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying propertys economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs is equal to 90 or more of the excess estimated fair value over retained tax credits of the leased asset if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease if the assumptions utilized in the above  		  		 			61 		   		 			table of contents 		 classifications assessments were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of a tenant improvement is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 		 		 			certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent is dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for operating lease straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent receivable amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of future minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unamortized unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment if these assessments were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 		 		 			loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans if management determined that certain loans should no longer be classified as heldforinvestment the timing and amount of our interest income recognized would be impacted 		 		 			loans receivable and dfls collectively finance receivables are reviewed and assigned an internal rating of performing watch list or workout finance receivables that are deemed performing meet all present contractual obligations and collection and timing of all amounts owed is reasonably assured watch list finance receivables are defined as finance receivables that do not meet the definition of performing or workout workout finance receivables are defined as finance receivables in which the company has determined based on current information and events that it is probable i it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement ii the tenant operator or borrower is delinquent on making payments under the contractual terms of the agreement iii and the company has commenced action or anticipates pursuing action in the near term to seek recovery of its investment 		 		 			 		  		 			62 		   		 			table of contents 		 finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured the asset will have an internal rating of either watch list or workout further we perform a credit analysis to support the tenants operators borrowers andor guarantors repayment capacity and the underlying collateral values we use the cash basis method of accounting for finance receivables placed on nonaccrual status unless one of the following conditions exist whereby we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting i if we determine that it is probable that we will only recover the recorded investment in the finance receivable net of associated allowances or chargeoffs if any or ii we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of an impaired finance receivable for cash basis method of accounting we apply payments received excluding principal paydowns to interest income so long as that amount does not exceed the amount that would have been earned under the original contractual terms for cost recovery method of accounting any payment received is applied to reduce the recorded investment generally we return a finance receivable to accrual status when all delinquent payments become current under the terms of the loan or lease agreements and collectibility of the remaining contractual loan or lease payments is reasonably assured 		 		 			allowances are established for finance receivables on an individual basis utilizing an estimate of probable losses if they are determined to be impaired finance receivables are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessees or borrowers overall financial condition economic resources payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivables effective interest rate fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors as appropriate should a finance receivable be deemed partially or wholly uncollectible the uncollectible balance is charged off against the allowance in the period in which the uncollectible determination has been made 		 		 			real estate 		 		 			we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of allocating fair value to inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases 		 		 			a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project to be considered substantially complete and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 		 		 			impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 		 		 			we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be recoverable but at least annually recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 		 		 			 		  		 			63 		   		 			table of contents 		 goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually based on certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount potential impairment indicators and qualitative factors include a significant decline in real estate valuations restructuring plans current macroeconomic conditions state of the equity and capital markets or a significant decline in the value of our market capitalization if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we apply the required twostep quantitative approach the quantitative procedures of the twostep approach i compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill and if necessary ii compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities excluding goodwill is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment if any we estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques including applying capitalization rates to segment net operating income quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals as necessary the fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company 		 		 			the determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results resulting cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 		 		 			investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 		 		 			the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment indicators based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of a fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 		 		 			  		 		 			income taxes 		 		 			as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential for builtin gain recognition and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision 		 		 			recent accounting pronouncements 		 		 			see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards 		 		 			item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 		 		 			we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates specifically the gbp we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements 		 		 			 		  		 			64 		   		 			table of contents 		 to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 6 million see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis details 		 		 			interest rate risk 		 		 			at december 31 2015 we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates primarily on variable rate debt which has been predominately hedged through interest rate swap contracts 		 		 			interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing if interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt whether at maturity or otherwise our future earnings and cash flows could adversely be affected by additional borrowing costs conversely lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate debt and variablerate investments and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2015 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 3 million or less than 001 per common share on a diluted basis 		 		 			  		 		 			foreign currency exchange rate risk 		 		 			at december 31 2015 our exposure to foreign currencies primarily relates to uk investments in leased real estate senior notes and related gbp denominated cash flows our foreign currency exposure is partially mitigated through the use of gbp denominated borrowings and foreign currency swap contracts based solely on our operating results for the three months ended december 31 2015 including the impact of existing hedging arrangements if the value of the gbp relative to the us dollar were to increase or decrease by 10 compared to the average exchange rate during the quarter ended december 31 2015 our cash flows would have decreased or increased as applicable by less than 1 million 		 		 			market risk 		 		 			we have investments in marketable debt securities classified as heldtomaturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current adjusted carrying value the issuers financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the market value if any at december 31 2015 both the fair value and carrying value of marketable debt securities were 103 million 		 		 			 		  		 			65

assumptions in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from managements estimates 		 		 			principles of consolidation 		 		 			  		 		 			the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc its whollyowned subsidiaries joint ventures and variable interest entities that it controls through voting rights or other means intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation 		 		 			the company is required to continually evaluate its vie relationships and consolidate these entities when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of their operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support ii substantially all of an entitys activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights or iii the equity investors as a group lack if any a the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of an entity 		 		 			a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie the company qualitatively assesses whether it is or is not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to its form of ownership interest its representation on the vies governing body the size and seniority of its investment its ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions and its ability to replace the vie manager andor liquidate the entity 		 		 			for its investments in joint ventures that are not considered to be vies the company evaluates the type of ownership rights held by the limited partners that may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership the assessment of limited partners rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the limited partner rights ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership interest in the limited partnership or iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests the company similarly evaluates the rights of managing members of limited liability companies 		 		 			revenue recognition 		 		 			at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments the company assesses its terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or  		  		 			74 		   		 			table of contents 		 more of the underlying propertys economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs is equal to 90 or more of the excess fair value over retained tax credits of the leased property if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease dfl 		 		 			the company utilizes the direct finance method of accounting to record dfl income for a lease accounted for as a dfl the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property less the unamortized unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease term to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured 		 		 			the company recognizes rental revenue for operating lease arrangements when the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the companyowned tenant improvements are substantially completed if a lease arrangement provides for tenant improvements the company determines whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or the company when the company is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvements funded by the tenant are treated as lease payments which are deferred and amortized into income over the lease term when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance that is funded by the company is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term ownership of tenant improvements is determined based on various factors including but not limited to the following criteria 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			lease stipulations of how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent 		 			 				  			 		 			 			which party to the arrangement retains legal title to the tenant improvements upon lease expiration 		 			 				  			 		 			 			whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general purpose in nature and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			if the tenant improvements are expected to have significant residual value at the end of the lease term 		 			certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds and only after any contingency has been removed when the related thresholds are achieved this may result in the recognition of rental revenue in periods subsequent to when such payments are received 		 		 			tenant recoveries subject to operating leases generally relate to the reimbursement of real estate taxes insurance and repairs and maintenance expense these expenses are recognized as revenue in the period they are incurred the reimbursements of these expenses are recognized and presented gross as the company is generally the primary obligor and with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the associated credit risk 		 		 			for operating leases with minimum scheduled rent increases the company recognizes income on a straight line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured recognizing rental income on a straight line basis results in a difference in the timing of revenue amounts from what is contractually due from tenants if the company determines that collectibility of straight line rents is not reasonably assured future revenue recognition is limited to amounts contractually owed and paid and when appropriate an allowance for estimated losses is established 		 		 			resident fee revenue is recorded when services are rendered and includes resident room and care charges community fees and other resident charges residency agreements are generally for a term of 30 days to one year with resident fees billed monthly revenue for certain care related services is recognized as services are provided and is billed monthly in arrears 		 		 			loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity loans heldforinvestment are carried at amortized cost and are reduced by a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses as necessary the company recognizes interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums loan fees paid and received using the interest method the interest method is applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums and discounts are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans loans are transferred from heldforinvestment to  		  		 			75 		   		 			table of contents 		 heldforsale when managements intent is to no longer hold the loans for the foreseeable future loans heldforsale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value 		 		 			the company recognizes gain on sales of real estate upon the closing of a transaction with the purchaser gains on real estate sold are recognized using the full accrual method when collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured the company is not obligated to perform additional activities that may be considered significant the initial investment from the buyer is sufficient and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied gain on sales of real estate may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition have been met 		 		 			the company receives investment management fees from certain joint venture entities for various services it provides as the managing member management fees are recorded as revenue when management services have been performed intercompany profit for management fees is eliminated 		 		 			allowance for doubtful accounts 		 		 			the company evaluates the liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants operators and borrowers on a monthly and quarterly basis the companys evaluation considers industry and economic conditions individual and portfolio property performance credit enhancements liquidity and other factors the companys tenants borrowers and operators furnish property portfolio and guarantoroperatorlevel financial statements among other information on a monthly or quarterly basis the company utilizes this financial information to calculate the lease or debt service

including revenue expense net operating income occupancy rental rate reimbursement trends capital expenditures and ebitda defined as earnings before interest tax and depreciation and amortization along with other liquidity measures the company evaluates on a monthly basis or immediately upon a significant change in circumstance its tenants operators and borrowers ability to service their obligations with the company 		 		 			the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for straightline rent receivables resulting from tenants inability to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments or lease defaults for straightline rent receivables the companys assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the lease term 		 		 			in connection with the companys quarterly review process or upon the occurrence of a significant event loans receivable and dfls collectively finance receivables are reviewed and assigned an internal rating of performing watch list or workout finance receivables that are deemed performing meet all present contractual obligations and collection and timing of all amounts owed is reasonably assured watch list finance receivables are defined as finance receivables that do not meet the definition of performing or workout workout finance receivables are defined as finance receivables in which the company has determined based on current information and events that it is probable i it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement ii the tenant operator or borrower is delinquent on making payments under the contractual terms of the agreement and iii the company has commenced action or anticipates pursuing action in the near term to seek recovery of its investment 		 		 			finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured the asset will have an

			the fair value of the four seasons notes used to calculate the impairment charge was based on quoted market prices however because the four seasons notes are not actively traded these prices are

repay the four seasons notes according to their contractual terms based on its estimate of future cash flows the estimated future cash flow inputs included forecasted revenues capital expenditures operating expenses care home occupancy and continued implementation of four seasons business plan which includes executing on its business line segmentation and continuing to invest in its core real
