healthcare real estate investing and  ongoing consolidation of a fragmented healthcare real estate sector    our website address is wwwhcpicom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form

profitable growth which allows us to maintain or increase dividends per share to our shareholders our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing    opportunistic investing    we make investment decisions that are expected to drive profitable growth and create shareholder value we attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of situations to meet our goals and investment criteria    portfolio diversification    we believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare investments diversified by segment geography operator tenant and investment product we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment product geographic location the number of properties which we may lease to a single operator or tenant or loans we may make to a single borrower with investments in multiple segments and investment products we can focus on opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for the portfolio as a whole we may structure transactions as master leases require operator or tenant insurance and indemnifications obtain credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits and take other measures to mitigate risk    conservative financing    we believe a conservative balance sheet is important to our ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach we strive to maintain a conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debttoequity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit facility access to capital markets and secured debt lenders relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners and our ability to divest of assets our debt obligations are primarily fixed rate with staggered maturities which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations   we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing through offerings of  4      table of contents equity and debt securities placement of mortgage debt and capital from other institutional lenders and equity investors   we specifically incorporate by reference into this section the information set forth in item 7 2012 transaction overview included elsewhere in this report   competition   investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies pension funds private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends   income from our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with other companies on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and the financial condition of our tenants and operators private federal and state payment programs as well as the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see risk factors in item 1a   healthcare segments   senior housing at december 31 2012 we had interests in 441 senior housing facilities 21 of which are in a ridea structure excluding ridea properties all of our senior housing facilities are leased to single tenants under triplenet lease structures senior housing facilities include assisted living facilities alfs independent living facilities ilfs and continuing care retirement communities ccrcs which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs services provided by our operators or tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicaid and medicare our senior housing property types are further described below    assisted living facilities alfs are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services support and housing for those who need help with activities of daily living adl such as bathing eating and dressing yet require limited medical care the programs and services may include transportation social activities exercise and fitness programs beauty or barber shop access hobby and craft activities community excursions meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents these facilities are often in apartmentlike buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments certain alfs may offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents requiring memory care as a result of alzheimers disease or other forms of dementia levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations at december 31 2012 we had interests in 363 alfs   independent living facilities ilfs are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as housekeeping meals and activities these residents generally do not need assistance with adl however in some of our   5      table of contents   facilities residents have the option to contract for these services at december 31 2012 we had interests in 64 ilfs    continuing care retirement communities ccrcs provide housing and healthrelated services under longterm contracts this alternative is appealing to residents as it eliminates the need for relocating when health and medical needs change thus allowing residents to age in place some ccrcs require a substantial entry or buyin fee and most also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit meals and some health services ccrcs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry at december 31 2012 we had interests in 14 ccrcs    during the

these properties contain similar characteristics to commercial office buildings they generally contain more advanced electrical mechanical and heating ventilating and air conditioning hvac systems the facilities generally have specialty equipment including emergency generators fume hoods lab bench tops and related amenities in many instances life science tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space in addition to landlord improvements to accommodate biology chemistry or medical device research initiatives life science properties are primarily configured in business park or campus settings and include multiple buildings the business park and campus settings allow us the opportunity to provide flexible contiguousadjacent expansion to accommodate the growth of

ancillary service space and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers rehabilitation clinics and daysurgery operating rooms while these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings they require additional plumbing electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room and special equipment such as xray machines in addition mobs are often built to accommodate higher structural loads for certain equipment and may contain vaults or other specialized construction our mobs are typically multitenant properties leased to healthcare providers hospitals and physician practices with approximately 77 of our mobs based on square feet located on hospital campuses and 94 are affiliated with hospital systems at december 31 2012 47 of

includes revenues earned from both our medical office and hospital segments   investment products   properties under lease we primarily generate revenue by leasing properties under longterm leases most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triplenet leases or leases that provide for a substantial recovery of operating expenses however some of our mobs and life science facility rents are structured under gross or modified gross leases accordingly for such gross or modified gross leases we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities and insurance   our ability to grow income from properties under lease depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels ii maximize tenant recoveries and iii control nonrecoverable operating expenses most of our leases include contractual annual base rent escalation clauses that are either predetermined fixed increases andor are a function of an inflation index   debt investments our mezzanine loans are generally secured by a pledge of ownership interests of an entity or entities which directly or indirectly own properties and are subordinate to more senior debt including mortgages and more senior mezzanine loans borrowers of our interests in mortgage and construction loans are typically healthcare providers and healthcare real estate generally secures these loans   developments and redevelopments we generally commit to development projects that are at least 50 preleased or when we believe that market conditions will support speculative construction we work closely with our local real estate service providers including brokerage property management project management and construction management companies to assist us in evaluating development proposals and completing developments our development and redevelopment investments are primarily in our life science and medical office segments redevelopments are properties that require  8      table of contents significant capital expenditures generally more than 25 of acquisition cost or existing basis to update achieve stabilization or to change the primary use of the properties   investment management we coinvest in real estate properties with institutional investors through joint ventures structured as partnerships or limited liability companies we target institutional investors with longterm investment horizons who seek to benefit from our expertise in healthcare real estate predominantly we retain noncontrolling interests in the joint ventures ranging from 20 to 30 and serve as the managing member these ventures generally allow us to earn acquisition and asset management fees and have the potential for promoted interests or incentive distributions based on performance of the joint venture   operating properties ridea we may enter into contracts with healthcare operators to manage communities that are placed in a structure permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 commonly referred to as ridea under the provisions of ridea a reit may lease qualified healthcare properties on an arms length basis to a taxable reit subsidiary trs if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an eligible independent contractor we view ridea as a structure primarily to be used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points and to drive growth by i transitioning the asset to a new operator that can bring scale operating efficiencies andor ancillary services or ii investing capital to reposition the asset   portfolio summary   at december 31 2012 we managed

december 31 2012 we had 149 fulltime employees none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement   government regulation licensing and enforcement    overview    our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices government reimbursement licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wideranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws and regulations and reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and  10      table of contents operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under risk factors in item 1a   based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators excluding our medical office segment at december 31 2012 we estimate that approximately 18 and 14 of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement respectively   the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us    fraud and abuse enforcement    there are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs ii federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the stark law which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v federal and state privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws    reimbursement    sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among other sources governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare program and state medicaid programs and nongovernmental payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government and many states face significant budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators    healthcare licensure and certificate of need    certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion and closure of certain healthcare facilities the  11      table of contents approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants and operators abilities to expand or change their businesses    life science facilities    while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other such tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and money in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance    senior housing entrance fee communities    certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facilitys financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters    americans with disabilities act the ada    our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect    environmental matters    a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owners or secured lenders liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our revenues for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see risk factors in item 1a of this report  12                   table of contents
