information on the spinoff 		 		 			  		 		 			for a description of our significant activities during 2016 see item 7 in this report 		 		 			  		 		 			business strategy 		 		 			we invest and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize the benefit to our stockholders and support the growth of our dividends the core elements of our strategy are i to acquire develop lease own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across multiple geographic locations and business segments including senior housing medical office and life science among others ii to align ourselves with leading healthcare companies operators and service providers which over the longterm should result in higher relative rental rates net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values iii to maintain adequate liquidity with longterm fixed rate debt financing with staggered maturities which supports the longerterm nature of our investments while reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk at any point in the interest rate or credit cycles and iv to continue to manage our balance sheet with a targeted financial leverage of 40 relative to our assets 		 		 			internal growth strategies 		 		 			we believe our real estate portfolio holds the potential for increased future cash flows as it is wellmaintained and in desirable locations within markets where new supply is generally limited by the lack of available sites and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary licensing other approvals andor financing our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties  		 		 			we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			build and maintain longterm leasing and management relationships with quality tenants and operators in choosing locations for our properties we focus on their physical environment adjacency to established businesses eg hospital systems and educational centers proximity to sources of business growth and other local demographic factors 		 			 				  			 		 			 			replace tenants and operators at the best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs we believe that we are wellpositioned to attract new tenants and operators and achieve attractive rental rates and operating cash flow as a result of the location design and maintenance of our properties together with our reputation for highquality building services and responsiveness to tenants and our ability to offer space alternatives within our portfolio 		 			 		  		 			3 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			extend and modify terms of existing leases prior to expiration we structure lease extensions early renewals or modifications which reduce the cost associated with lease downtime or the reinvestment risk resulting from the exercise of tenants purchase options while securing the tenancy and relationship of our high quality tenants and operators on a longterm basis 		 			investment strategies 		 		 			the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling longterm demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector 		 		 			while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies 		 		 			we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment vehicle or geographic location the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator or loans that may be made to a single borrower in allocating capital we target opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for our portfolio as a whole we may take additional measures to mitigate risk including diversifying our investments by sector geography tenant or operator structuring transactions as master leases requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications and obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits 		 		 			we believe we are wellpositioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions financing and development other factors that contribute to our competitive position include  		 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our reputation gained through over 30 years of successful operations and the strength of our existing portfolio of properties 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with leading healthcare operators and systems investment banks and other market intermediaries corporations private equity firms nonprofits and public institutions seeking to monetize existing assets or develop new facilities 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of highquality healthcare real estate 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions responsively and efficiently which provides confidence to domestic and foreign institutions and private investors who seek to sell healthcare real estate in our market areas 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the healthcare and real estate industries and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our control of sites including assets under contract with radius restrictions 		 			financing strategies 		 		 			our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains therefore we dont retain a significant amount of capital as a result we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt  		 		 			we may finance acquisitions and other investments through the following vehicles 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			borrowings under our credit facility  		 			 				  			 		 			 			issuance or origination of debt including unsecured notes term loans and mortgage debt  		 			 		  		 			4 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			sale of ownership interests in properties or other investments or  		 			 				  			 		 			 			issuance of common or preferred stock or equivalent 		 			we maintain a disciplined balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity our debt obligations are primarily longterm fixed rate with staggered maturities 		 		 			we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing by offering debt and equity securities placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders and joint venture partners

of 2008 commonly referred to as ridea and include independent living facilities ilfs assisted living facilities alfs memory care facilities mcfs care homes and continuing care retirement communities ccrcs which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs services provided by our tenants or operators in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 		 		 			we have entered into longterm agreements with operators including brookdale senior living inc brookdale to operate and manage properties that are operated under a ridea structure under the provisions of ridea a reit may lease a qualified healthcare property on an arms length basis to a taxable reit subsidiary trs if the property is managed on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an eligible independent contractor ridea structures allow us to own the risks and rewards of the operations of healthcare facilities as compared to leasing the property for contractual triplenet rents in a tax efficient manner we view ridea as a structure primarily to be used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points andor growth profiles by i transitioning the asset to a new operator that can bring scale operating efficiencies andor ancillary services or ii investing capital to reposition the asset brookdale provides comprehensive facility management and accounting services with respect to a majority of our senior housing ridea properties for which we pay annual management fees pursuant to the aforementioned agreements most of the management agreements have terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with three to four 5year renewals the base management fees are 45 to 50 of gross revenues as defined generated by the ridea facilities in addition there are incentive management fees payable to brookdale if operating results of the ridea properties exceed preestablished ebitdar defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and rent thresholds  		 		 			our senior housing property types under both triplenet leases and ridea structures are further described below 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			independent living facilities ilfs are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded socially by their peers with services such as housekeeping meals and activities additionally the programs and services may include transportation social activities exercise and fitness programs beauty or barber shop access hobby and craft activities community excursions meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents these residents generally do not need assistance with activities of daily living adl however in some of our facilities residents have the option to contract for these services  		 			 		  		 			5 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			assisted living facilities alfs are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services support and housing for those who need help with adl such as bathing eating dressing and medication management yet require limited medical care these facilities are often in apartmentlike buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments certain alfs may have a dedicated portion of a facility that offers higher levels of personal assistance for residents requiring memory care as a result of alzheimers disease or other forms of dementia levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations  		 			 				  			 		 			 			memory care facilities mcfs address the unique challenges of our residents with alzheimers disease or other forms of dementia residents may live in semiprivate apartments or private rooms and have structured activities delivered by staff members trained specifically on how to care for residents with memory impairment these facilities offer programs that provide comfort and care in a secure environment  		 			 				  			 		 			 			continuing care retirement communities ccrcs offer several levels of assistance including independent living assisted living and nursing home care ccrcs are different from other housing and care options for seniors because they usually provide written agreements or longterm contracts between residents and the communities frequently lasting the term of the residents lifetime which offer a continuum of housing services and healthcare on one campus or site ccrcs are appealing as they allow residents to age in place ccrcs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry  		 			the following table
