		 		 			the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc its whollyowned subsidiaries joint ventures and variable interest entities that it controls through voting rights or other means intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation 		 		 			the company is required to continually evaluate its vie relationships and consolidate these entities when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of their operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support ii substantially all of an entitys activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights or iii the equity investors as a group lack any of the following a the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of an entity 		 		 			a variable interest holder is

beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to its form of ownership interest its representation on the vies governing body the size and seniority of its investment its ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions and its ability to replace the vie manager andor liquidate the entity 		 		 			for its investments in

general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership the assessment of limited partners rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the limited partner rights ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership interest in the limited partnership or iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests the

customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services asu 201608 is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations asu 201612 provides practical expedients and improvements on the previously narrow scope of asu 201409 in august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201514 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 deferral of the effective date asu 201514 asu 201514 defers the effective date of asu 201409 by one year to

asu 201514 early adoption of the revenue asus is permitted for annual periods and interim periods within beginning after december 15 2016 a reporting entity may apply the amendments in the revenue asus using either a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulativeeffect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption or full retrospective approach the company is evaluating the complete impact of the adoption of the revenue asus on january 1 2018 to its consolidated financial position and results of operations as the primary source of revenue for the company is generated through leasing arrangements which are excluded from the revenue asus the company expects that it will be impacted in its recognition of nonlease revenue such as certain resident fees in its ridea structures a portion of which are not generated through leasing arrangements and its recognition of real estate sale transactions under asu 201409 revenue recognition for real estate sales is largely based on the transfer of control versus continuing involvement under current guidance as a result the company generally expects that the new guidance will result in more transactions qualifying as sales of real estate and revenue being recognized at an earlier date than under current accounting guidance  		 		 			reclassifications 		 		 			certain amounts in the companys

spinoff date 		 		 			the plans were established with antidilution provisions such that in the event of an equity restructuring of the company including spinoff transactions equity awards would preserve their value posttransaction in order to achieve an equitable modification of the existing awards following the spinoff the company converted prespin awards to their postspin value resulting in grants to remaining employees denominated solely in the companys common stock the modification assumed a conversion ratio on all awards calculated as the final prespin closing price of the companys common stock divided by the five trading day average postspin closing price five day average price of the companys common stock the conversion impacted 133 participants resulted in additional awards being granted and incremental fair value of unvested awards due to the difference between the five day average price and the prespin closing price on the spinoff date the vesting periods were unchanged for unvested grants at the spinoff date the incremental fair value of unvested awards was immaterial 		 		 			stock options  		 		 			stock options are granted with an exercise price per

required to pay the exercise price of the stock options being exercised and the related tax withholding obligation  		 		 			there have been no grants of stock options since 2014 stock options outstanding and exercisable were 13 million and 12 million at december 31 2016 respectively and 17 million and 14 million at december 31 2015 respectively proceeds received from stock options exercised under the plans for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 were 4 million 28 million and 5 million respectively compensation expense related to stock options was immaterial for all

certain restrictions conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant restrictions on certain awards generally lapse as provided in the plans or in the applicable award agreement upon retirement a change in control or other specified events the fair market value of restricted stock awards both time vesting and those subject to specific performance criteria are expensed over the period of vesting restricted stock units which vest based solely upon passage of time generally vest over a period of one to four years the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing market price of the companys shares on the grant date performance stock units which are restricted stock awards that  		  		 			112 		   		 			table of contents 		 vest dependent upon

withholding obligation participants can generally elect to have the company reduce the number of common stock shares delivered to pay the employee tax withholding obligation the value of the shares

impairments 		 		 			in june 2015 and september 2015 the company determined that its four seasons notes see note 10 were otherthantemporarily impaired resulting from a continued decrease in the fair value of its investment although the company does not intend to sell and does not believe it will be required to sell the four seasons notes before their maturity the company determined that a credit loss existed resulting from several factors including i deterioration in four seasons operating performance since the fourth quarter of 2014 and ii credit downgrades to four seasons received during the first half of 2015 accordingly the company recorded impairment charges during the three months ended june 30 2015 and september 30 2015 of 42 million and 70 million respectively reducing the carrying value of the four seasons notes at september 30 2015 to 100 million 66 million  		 		 			the fair value of the four seasons notes used to calculate the impairment charge was based on quoted market prices however because the four seasons notes are not actively traded these prices are considered to be level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy when calculating the fair value and determining whether a credit loss existed the company also evaluated four seasons ability to repay the four seasons notes according to their contractual terms based on its estimate of future cash flows the estimated future cash flow inputs included forecasted revenues capital expenditures operating expenses care home occupancy and continued implementation of four seasons business plan which includes executing on its business line segmentation and continuing to invest in its core real estate portfolio this information was consistent with the results of the valuation technique used by the company to determine if a credit loss existed and to calculate the fair value of the four seasons notes during its impairment review 		 		 			in june 2015 the company determined a mob was impaired and
