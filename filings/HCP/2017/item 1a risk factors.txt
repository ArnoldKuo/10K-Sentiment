an sampp 500 company invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the united states us we are a maryland corporation organized in 1985 and qualify as a selfadministered real estate investment trust reit we are headquartered in irvine california with offices in nashville and san francisco our diverse portfolio is comprised of investments in the following reportable healthcare segments i senior housing triplenet sh nnn ii senior housing operating portfolio shop iii life science and iv medical office  		 		 			on october 31 2016 we completed the spinoff the spinoff of quality care properties inc qcp nyseqcp the spinoff included 338 properties primarily comprised of the hcr manorcare inc hcrmc direct financing lease dfl investments and an equity investment in hcrmc qcp is an independent publiclytraded selfmanaged and selfadministrated reit see notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the spinoff 		 		 			  		 		 			for a description of our significant activities during 2016 see item 7 in this report 		 		 			  		 		 			business strategy 		 		 			we invest and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize the benefit to our stockholders and support the growth of our dividends the core elements of our strategy are i to acquire develop lease own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across multiple geographic locations and business segments including senior housing medical office and life science among others ii to align ourselves with leading healthcare companies operators and service providers which over the longterm should result in higher relative rental rates net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values iii to maintain adequate liquidity with longterm fixed rate debt financing with staggered maturities which supports the longerterm nature of our investments while reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk at any point in the interest rate or credit cycles and iv to continue to manage our balance sheet with a targeted financial leverage of 40 relative to our assets 		 		 			internal growth strategies 		 		 			we believe our real estate portfolio holds the potential for increased future cash flows as it is wellmaintained and in desirable locations within markets where new supply is generally limited by the lack of available sites and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary licensing other approvals andor financing our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties  		 		 			we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			build and maintain longterm leasing and management relationships with quality tenants and operators in choosing locations for our properties we focus on their physical environment adjacency to established businesses eg hospital systems and educational centers proximity to sources of business growth and other local demographic factors 		 			 				  			 		 			 			replace tenants and operators at the best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs we believe that we are wellpositioned to attract new tenants and operators and achieve attractive rental rates and operating cash flow as a result of the location design and maintenance of our properties together with our reputation for highquality building services and responsiveness to tenants and our ability to offer space alternatives within our portfolio 		 			 		  		 			3 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			extend and modify terms of existing leases prior to expiration we structure lease extensions early renewals or modifications which reduce the cost associated with lease downtime or the reinvestment risk resulting from the exercise of tenants purchase options while securing the tenancy and relationship of our high quality tenants and operators on a longterm basis 		 			investment strategies 		 		 			the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling longterm demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector 		 		 			while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies 		 		 			we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment vehicle or geographic location the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator or loans that may be made to a single borrower in allocating capital we target opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for our portfolio as a whole we may take additional measures to mitigate risk including diversifying our investments by sector geography tenant or operator structuring transactions as master leases requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications and obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits 		 		 			we believe we are wellpositioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions financing and development other factors that contribute to our competitive position include  		 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our reputation gained through over 30 years of successful operations and the strength of our existing portfolio of properties 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with leading healthcare operators and systems investment banks and other market intermediaries corporations private equity firms nonprofits and public institutions seeking to monetize existing assets or develop new facilities 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of highquality healthcare real estate 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions responsively and efficiently which provides confidence to domestic and foreign institutions and private investors who seek to sell healthcare real estate in our market areas 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the healthcare and real estate industries and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our control of sites including assets under contract with radius restrictions 		 			financing strategies 		 		 			our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains therefore we dont retain a significant amount of capital as a result we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt  		 		 			we may finance acquisitions and other investments through the following vehicles 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			borrowings under our credit facility  		 			 				  			 		 			 			issuance or origination of debt including unsecured notes term loans and mortgage debt  		 			 		  		 			4 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			sale of ownership interests in properties or other investments or  		 			 				  			 		 			 			issuance of common or preferred stock or equivalent 		 			we maintain a disciplined balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity our debt obligations are primarily longterm fixed rate with staggered maturities 		 		 			we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing by offering debt and

housing facilities are managed utilizing triplenet leases and ridea structures which are permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 commonly referred to as ridea and include independent living facilities ilfs assisted living facilities alfs memory care facilities mcfs care homes and continuing care retirement communities ccrcs which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs services provided by our tenants or operators in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 		 		 			we have entered into longterm agreements with operators including brookdale senior living inc brookdale to operate and manage properties that are operated under a ridea structure under the provisions of ridea a reit may lease a qualified healthcare property on an arms length basis to a taxable reit subsidiary trs if the property is managed on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an eligible independent contractor ridea structures allow us to own the risks and rewards of the operations of healthcare facilities as compared to leasing the property for contractual triplenet rents in a tax efficient manner we view ridea as a structure primarily to be used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points andor growth profiles by i transitioning the asset to a new operator that can bring scale operating efficiencies andor ancillary services or ii investing capital to reposition the asset brookdale provides comprehensive facility management and accounting services with respect to a majority of our senior housing ridea properties for which we pay annual management fees pursuant to the aforementioned agreements most of the management agreements have terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with three to four 5year renewals the base management fees are 45 to 50 of gross revenues as defined generated by the ridea facilities in addition there are incentive management fees payable to brookdale if operating results of the ridea properties exceed preestablished ebitdar defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and rent thresholds  		 		 			our senior housing property types under both triplenet leases and ridea structures are further described below 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			independent living facilities ilfs are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded socially by their peers with services such as housekeeping meals and activities additionally the programs and services may include transportation social activities exercise and fitness programs beauty or barber shop access hobby and craft activities community excursions meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents these residents generally do not need assistance with

			 			assisted living facilities alfs are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services support and housing for those who need help with adl such as bathing eating dressing and medication management yet require limited medical care these facilities are often in apartmentlike buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments certain alfs may have a dedicated portion of a facility that offers higher levels of personal assistance for residents requiring memory care as a result of alzheimers disease or other forms of dementia levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations  		 			 				  			 		 			 			memory care facilities mcfs address the unique challenges of our residents with alzheimers disease or other forms of dementia residents may live in semiprivate apartments or private rooms and have structured activities delivered by staff members trained specifically on how to care for residents with memory impairment these facilities offer programs that provide comfort and care in a secure environment  		 			 				  			 		 			 			continuing care retirement communities ccrcs offer several levels of assistance including independent living assisted living and nursing home care ccrcs are different from other housing and care options for seniors because they usually provide written agreements or longterm contracts between residents and the communities frequently lasting the term of the residents lifetime which offer a continuum of housing services and healthcare on one campus or site ccrcs are appealing as they allow residents to age in place ccrcs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry  		 			the following table provides information

			  		 		 			government regulation licensing and enforcement  		 		 			overview 		 		 			our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care licensure and certificate of need government reimbursement fraud and abuse practices and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws regulations reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under item 1a risk factors in this report 		 		 			based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators including our medical office segment at december 31 2016 we estimate that approximately 13 and 12 15 and 14 excluding our medical office segment of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement respectively 		 		 			the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 		 		 			fraud and abuse enforcement 		 		 			there are various extremely complex us federal and state laws and regulations and in relation to our facilities located in the uk national laws and regulations of england scotland northern ireland and wales governing healthcare providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i us federal state false claims acts and uk antifraud legislation and regulation which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other us federal or state or uk healthcare programs ii us federal state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit or restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services and uk legislation and regulations on financial inducements and vested interests iii us federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the stark law which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v us federal state and uk privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 commonly referred to as hipaa and the uk data protection act 1988 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of us and uk healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and in the us can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions many of our tenants and operators are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws 		 		 			 		  		 			8 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			reimbursement  		 		 			sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare programs and state medicaid programs and in the uk the national health service nhs and local authority funding and nongovernmental thirdparty payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government many states face significant current and future budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators similarly in the uk the nhs and the local authorities are undertaking efforts to reduce costs which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by our uk tenants and operators additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the us including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations aco and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants and operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations  		 		 			healthcare licensure and certificate of need 		 		 			certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio including our facilities located in the uk are subject to extensive national federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to handle controlled substances including narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states in the us require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants and operators abilities to expand or change their businesses 		 		 			life science facilities 		 		 			while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 		 		 			senior housing entrance fee communities 		 		 			certain of our senior housing facilities are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facilitys financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 		 		 			americans with disabilities act the ada 		 		 			our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 		 		 			environmental matters 		 		 			a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an  		  		 			9 		   		 			table of contents 		 owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the value of such property and the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our earnings for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see item 1a risk factors in this report 		 		 			  		 		 			insurance 		 		 			we obtain various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property business interruption liability flood windstorm earthquake environmental and terrorism related losses we attempt to obtain appropriate policy terms conditions limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss the cost of such coverage and current industry practice there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable in addition we have a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake flood and windstorm occurrences which carry higher deductibles 		 		 			we maintain property insurance for all of our properties and this insurance is primary for our shop ridea life science and medical office segments tenants under triplenet leases primarily in our sh nnn segment are required to provide primary property business interruption and liability insurance we maintain separate general and professional liability insurance for our shop ridea facilities additionally our corporate general liability insurance program also extends coverage for all of our properties beyond the aforementioned we periodically review whether we or our ridea operators will bear responsibility for maintaining the required insurance coverage for the applicable shop properties but the costs of such insurance are facility expenses paid from the revenues of those properties

materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			as set forth below we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to our business and operations 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to our capital structure and market conditions  		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to other events and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to tax including reitrelated risks 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			risks related to our business and operations 		 		 			we depend on one tenant and operator brookdale for a significant percentage of our revenues and net operating income continuing adverse developments including operational challenges in brookdales business and affairs or financial condition would likely have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			we manage our facilities utilizing ridea and triplenet lease lease arrangements structures as of december 31 2016 brookdale leased or managed 212 senior housing facilities that we own and 16 shop facilities owned by our unconsolidated joint venture pursuant to longterm lease and management agreements  		 		 			  		 		 			properties managed by brookdale under ridea structures as of december 31 2016 accounted for 18 of our gross segment assets services provided by our managers in facilities managed under a ridea structure are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs we report the resident level fees and services revenues and corresponding operating expenses in our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			  		 		 			 		  		 			11 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			in addition to our ridea structures with brookdale our leases with respect to brookdale as a tenant accounted for 12 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 		 		 			  		 		 			although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements we rely on brookdales personnel expertise technical resources and information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage our related senior living operations efficiently and effectively we also rely on brookdale to set appropriate resident fees manage occupancy provide accurate and complete propertylevel financial results for these senior housing communities in a timely manner and otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations 		 		 			  		 		 			in its capacity as a manager in the ridea structures brookdale does not lease our properties and therefore our exposure to its credit risk is in a different manner as compared to a triplenet tenant brookdale has experienced significant challenges in integrating its july 2014 acquisition of emeritus corp and has been adversely affected by increased competition that has negatively impacted occupancy rates and in certain cases brookdale has offered additional discounts and incentives to residents brookdale as well as our other operators has also experienced labor expense pressure and increased labor turnover 		 		 			  		 		 			in its capacity as a triplenet tenant we depend on brookdale to pay all insurance tax utilities maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties we depend on adequate maintenance and repair of the properties to remain competitive and attract and retain patients and residents adverse developments in brookdales business and related declining rent coverage ratios have increased its credit risk if these adverse developments result in prolonged inadequate property maintenance or improvements or impair brookdales access to capital necessary for maintenance or improvements it could lead to a significant reduction in occupancy rates and market rents which would likely have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			  		 		 			brookdales operational challenges and potential adverse developments in its business affairs and financial results could significantly divert managements attention increase employee turnover and impair its ability to manage the properties or its operations efficiently and effectively this could ultimately result in among other adverse events acceleration of brookdales indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code 		 		 			  		 		 			in addition brookdale depends on private sources for its revenues and the ability of its patients and residents to pay its fees for example costs associated with independent and assisted living services are not generally reimbursable under governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid accordingly brookdale depends on attracting seniors with appropriate levels of income and assets which may be affected by many factors including prevailing economic and market trends consumer confidence and demographics consequently if brookdale fails to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties it would adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which would have a materially adverse effect on its and our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			  		 		 			brookdale also relies on reimbursements from governmental programs for a portion of its revenues changes in reimbursement policies and other governmental regulation such as potential changes to or repeal of the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the affordable care act that may result from the new presidential administration may result in reductions in brookdales revenues operations and cash flows and affect its ability to meet its obligations to us for a further discussion of the legislation and regulation that are applicable to us and our tenants operators and borrowers see legislation and regulationthe requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants operators and borrowers ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us while brookdale generally has also agreed to indemnify us for various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with its business it may have insufficient assets income access to financing andor insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy its indemnification obligations 		 		 			  		 		 			 		  		 			12 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			the inability unwillingness or other failure of brookdale under its lease agreements and ridea structures to meet its obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow net operating income and results of operations and have other materially adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major tenants operators or borrowers may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to third party tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties we are also a direct or indirect lender to various tenants and operators we have very limited control over the success or failure of our tenants and operators businesses any of our tenants or operators may experience a downturn in its business that materially weakens its financial condition as a result they may fail to make payments when due although we generally have arrangements and other agreements that give us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or operator or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches  		 		 			a downturn in any of our tenants or operators businesses could ultimately lead to bankruptcy if it is unable to timely resolve the underlying causes which may be largely outside of its control bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies and realize any recoveries in connection therewith for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing  		 		 			a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its executory contracts and unexpired leases in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us obligations under such rejected leases would cease the claim against the rejecting debtor would be an unsecured claim which would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code this statutory cap may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may also assert in bankruptcy proceedings that leases should be recharacterized as financing agreements which could result in our being deemed a lender instead of a landlord a lenders rights and remedies as compared to a landlords generally are materially more unfavorable 		 		 			furthermore the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies unless we first obtain relief from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case this would effectively limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent and we may ultimately not receive any payment at all in addition we would likely be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes insurance debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant operator or manager additionally we lease many of our facilities to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting these operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may involve specific procedural or regulatory requirements and may not be successful even if eviction is possible we may determine not to do so due to reputational or other risks  		 		 			bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings may also result in increased costs to the operator and significant management distraction if we are unable to transition affected properties they could experience prolonged operational disruption leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues publicity about the operators financial condition and insolvency proceeds may also negatively impact their and our reputations decreasing customer demand and revenues any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues results of operations and cash flows these risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties 		 		 			 		  		 			13 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			additionally the financial weakness or other inability of our tenants operators or borrowers to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such borrowers tenants and operators or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in cross default under our other indebtedness although we may be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of a borrower tenant or operator may result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other materially adverse consequences 		 		 			increased competition and market and legislative changes have resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our tenants operators and borrowers and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 		 		 			the healthcare industry is highly competitive the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area in addition our tenants operators and borrowers face an increasingly competitive labor market for skilled management personnel and nurses an inability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and nurses and other trained personnel could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures on wages may force tenants operators and borrowers to enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for skilled personnel or to use more expensive contract personnel but they be unable to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses or any failure by our tenants operators or borrowers to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our cash flow and have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			our tenants operators and borrowers also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers this competition which is due in part to overdevelopment in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease our tenants operators and borrowers may be unable to achieve occupancy and rate levels and to manage their expenses in a way that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants operators and borrowers our tenants operators and borrowers may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses or to manage their expenses either of which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues and impairing our assets andor increasing collection and dispute costs 		 		 			in addition our operators revenues are determined by a number of factors including licensed bed capacity occupancy the healthcare needs of residents the rate of reimbursement and or a decrease the income or assets of seniors in the regions in which we operate for example due to generally increased vulnerability to illness occupancy at our senior housing facilities could significantly decrease in the event of a severe flu season an epidemic or any other widespread illness additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the united states including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations and bundled payments have resulted in reduced reimbursement rates average length of stay and average daily census particularly for higher acuity patients 		 		 			furthermore the new presidential administration and new congress has introduced uncertainty in the direction of the healthcare regulatory landscape and we cannot predict the impact of any regulatory or legislative changes on the industry or our ability to compete effectively therein see the risks described under legislation and regulationthe requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants operators and borrowers ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us  		 		 			 		  		 			14 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or to retain or attract tenants and operators 		 		 			we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities similarly our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators or may reduce the rents we are able to charge if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms or attract and retain profitable tenants and operators our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 		 		 			we depend on investments in the healthcare property sector making our profitability more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in that specific sector than if we were investing in multiple industries 		 		 			we concentrate our investments in the healthcare property sector as a result we are subject to risks inherent to investments in a single industry a downturn or slowdown in the healthcare property sector would have a greater adverse impact on our business than if we had investments in multiple industries specifically a downturn in the healthcare property sector could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us as well as the ability to maintain rental and occupancy rates this could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a downturn in the healthcare property sector could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties at prices or on terms acceptable to us 		 		 			in addition real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in the performance of our properties or economic and other conditions is limited we may be unable to recognize full value for any property that we seek to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular health care industries 		 		 			changes within the life science industry may adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 		 		 			our life science investments could be adversely affected if the life science industry is impacted by an economic financial or banking crisis or if the life science industry migrates from the us to other countries or to areas outside of primary markets in south san francisco and san diego also some of our properties may be better suited for a particular life science industry client tenant and could require modification before we are able to release vacant space to another life science industry client tenant generally our properties may not be suitable for lease to traditional office client tenants without significant expenditures on renovations 		 		 			our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations on future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and the demand for life science properties at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are proposed 		 		 			many life science entities have completed mergers or consolidations mergers or consolidations of life science entities in the future could reduce the amount of rentable square footage requirements of our client tenants and prospective client tenants which may adversely impact our revenues from lease payments and results of operations 		 		 			the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs and our other facilities that serve the healthcare industry 		 		 			our mobs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry depend on the viability of the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems in order to attract physicians and other healthcarerelated users the viability of these hospitals in turn depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided competition demographic trends in the surrounding community market position and growth potential as well  		  		 			15 		   		 			table of contents 		 as the ability of the affiliated healthcare systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital if a hospital whose campus is located on or near one of our mobs is unable to meet its financial obligations and if an affiliated healthcare system is unable to support that hospital the hospital may not be able to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcarerelated users because we rely on our proximity to and affiliations with these hospitals to create tenant demand for space in our mobs their inability to remain competitive or financially viable or to attract physicians and physician groups could adversely affect our mob operations and have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			in addition the potential repeal of the affordable care act and related regulations and uncertainty regarding potential replacement legislation could result in significant changes to the scope of insurance coverage and reimbursement policies which could put negative pressure on the operations and revenues of our mobs 		 		 			we may be unable to maintain or expand our relationships with our existing and future hospital and health system clients 		 		 			the success of our medical office portfolio depends to a large extent on past current and future relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems we invest significant amounts of time in developing relationships with both new and existing clients if we fail to maintain these relationships including through a lack of responsiveness failure to adapt to the current market and employment of individuals with adequate experience our reputation and relationships will be harmed and we may lose business to competitors if our relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems deteriorate it could have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas from which a greater percentage of our revenues is recognized could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			for the year ended december 31 2016 26 of our revenue was derived from properties located in california which is also where substantially all of our lifescience portfolio is located as a result we may be subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting the state including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions increased competition or decreased demand changes in statespecific legislation and local climate events and natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires and hurricanes which could cause significant disruption in our businesses in the region harm our ability to compete effectively result in increased costs and divert more management attention any or all of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 		 		 			if we must replace any of our tenants or operators we may have difficulty identifying replacements and we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other tenants and operators 		 		 			we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term if we or our tenants terminate or do not renew the leases for our properties we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific and may be subject to regulatory requirements a new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property depending on that tenants or operators particular business in addition infrastructure improvements for life science facilities typically are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types and we may be unable to recover part or all of these higher costs therefore if a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent andor vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property and experience delays before we are able to secure another tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators these expenditures or renovations and delays may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			additionally we may fail to identify suitable replacements or enter into leases or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases if at all we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations such as real estate taxes debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of and avoid the imposition of liens on our properties while they are being repositioned in addition we may incur certain obligations and liabilities including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator which could have a materially adverse  		  		 			16 		   		 			table of contents 		 effect on us 		 		 			we face additional risks associated with property development and redevelopment that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken 		 		 			property development is a component of our growth strategy for example in october 2016 we commenced the third phase of the cove at oyster point our newest life science development in south san francisco at december 31 2016 our actual investment and estimated commitments under our development and redevelopment platforms including land held for development represented approximately 673 million or 4 of our total assets largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred 		 			 				  			 		 			 			the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and higher materials transportation labor leasing or other costs which could make the completion of the development project less profitable 		 			 				  			 		 			 			the project may not be completed on schedule as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters labor conditions material shortages regulatory hurdles civil unrest and acts of war which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses or provide tenants or operators with the right to terminate preconstruction leases and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable  		 			any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments 		 		 			we have and may continue in the future to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decisionmaking authority which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes including litigation or arbitration 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners could have investment and financing goals that are not consistent with our objectives including the timing terms and strategies for any investments and what levels of debt to incur or carry 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest and risk to our reit status 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners might become bankrupt fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues 		 			any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			from time to time we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 		 		 			acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of  		  		 			17 		   		 			table of contents 		 the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include our ability to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities including 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			liabilities relating to the cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions 		 			 				  			 		 			 			unasserted claims of vendors residents patients or other persons dealing with the seller 		 			 				  			 		 			 			liabilities claims and litigation whether or not incurred in the

seller 		 			 				  			 		 			 			claims for return of government reimbursement payments and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition 		 			in addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use or for property improvements 		 		 			if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			from time to time we have made and we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds 		 		 			we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value our review process may require significant management attention and a potential transaction could be abandoned or rejected by us or the other parties involved after we expend significant resources and time in addition future acquisitions may require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures each of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 		 		 			our tenants operators and borrowers face litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs 		 		 			in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the tenants and operators of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients residents or whistleblowers has sought and sometimes resulted in large damage awards see the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants operators and borrowers ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants operators and borrowers for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our tenants and operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance or cause our borrowers to be unable to meet their obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits arising from the alleged actions of our tenants or operators for which claims such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify us but which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part furthermore although our leases and agreements provide us with certain information rights with respect to our tenants and operators one or more of our tenants may be or become party to pending litigation or investigation to which we are unaware or do not have a right to participate or evaluate in such cases we would be unable to determine the potential impact of such litigation or  		  		 			18 		   		 			table of contents 		 investigation on our tenants or our business or results moreover negative publicity of any of our operators or tenants litigation other

whereby we assume additional operational risks and are subject to additional regulation and liability 		 		 			ridea structures at the year ended december 31 2016 accounted for 24 of our gross segment assets ridea permits reits such as us to lease healthcare facilities that we own or partially own to a trs provided that our trs hires an independent qualifying management company to operate the facility under the ridea lease structure the independent qualifying management company receives a management fee from our trs for operating the facility as an independent contractor as the owner of the facility contracting out operational responsibility we assume more of the operational risk relative to other structures because we lease our facility to our own partially or whollyowned subsidiary rather than a third party operator our resulting revenues therefore depend more on occupancy rates the rates charged to residents and the ability to control operating expenses our trs and hence we are responsible for any operating deficits incurred by the facility 		 		 			the operator which would be our trs when we use a ridea lease structure of a healthcare facility is generally required to be the holder of the applicable healthcare license this licensing requirement subjects our trs and us through our ownership interest in our trs to various regulatory laws including those described above most states regulate and inspect healthcare facility operations patient care construction and the safety of the physical environment if one or more of our healthcare real estate facilities fails to comply with applicable laws our trs if it holds the healthcare license and is the entity enrolled in government health care programs could be subject to penalties including loss or suspension of license certification or accreditation exclusion from government healthcare programs ie medicare medicaid administrative sanctions civil monetary penalties and in certain instances criminal penalties additionally if our trs holds the healthcare license it could have exposure to professional liability claims arising out of an alleged breach of the applicable standard of care rules 		 		 			in addition rents from this trs structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if i they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified healthcare property with the trs and ii the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor as defined in the code if either of these conditions is not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents 		 		 			the requirements of

could result in among other challenges i becoming ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental reimbursement programs ii bans on admissions of new patients or residents iii civil or criminal penalties and iv significant operational changes these laws and regulations are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions for example we have provided a loan to tandem health care tandem a property

affected by the resources required to respond to an investigation or other enforcement action in such event the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants and the results of operations of our properties operated by those entities could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us we are unable to predict future federal state

changes in the regulatory framework could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants and operators which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			sometimes governmental payors freeze or reduce payments to healthcare providers or provide annual reimbursement rate increases that are smaller than expected due to budgetary and other pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our tenants operators and borrowers costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our tenants operators or borrowers to comply with these laws and regulations and significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 		 		 			furthermore executive orders and legislation may repeal the affordable care act and related regulations in whole or in part we also anticipate that congress state legislatures and thirdparty payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare system we cannot quantify or predict the likely impact of these possible changes on our business model prospects financial

disclosure of confidential information the risk of security breaches has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication  		  		 			26 		   		 			table of contents 		 of attacks have increased in some cases it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 		 		 			  		 		 			risk related to tax including reitrelated risks 		 		 			loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have materially adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock 		 		 			qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 		 		 			if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we will be subject to corporatelevel income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we could be subject to increased state and local income taxes and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a reit 		 			as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 		 		 			the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with reits constantly are under review by persons involved in the legislative process the us internal revenue service the irs and the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments and affect the tax considerations of an investment in us 		 		 			we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 		 		 			if during the fiveyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize a gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 		 		 			 		  		 			27 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any 		 		 			there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits eampp in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute eampp 		 		 			in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit eampp of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such eampp distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such eampp distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such eampp distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of eampp including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit eampp moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit eampp which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 		 		 			thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit eampp by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our eampp we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so 		 		 			recent tax legislation impacts certain us federal income tax rules applicable to reits and could adversely affect our current tax positions 		 		 			the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 the act contains changes to certain aspects of the us federal income tax rules applicable to us the act is the most recent example of changes to the reit rules and additional legislative changes may occur that could adversely affect our current tax positions the act modifies various rules that apply to our ownership of and business relationship with our trss and reduces the maximum allowable value of our assets attributable to trss from 25 to 20 which could impact our ability to enter into future investments the act makes permanent the reduction of the recognition period from ten years to five years during which an entity that converted from a corporation to a reit or was acquired by a reit is subject to a corporatelevel tax on builtin gains recognized during such period which could influence the types of investments we enter into in the future the act also makes multiple changes related to the foreign investment in real property tax act or firpta expands prohibited transaction safe harbors and qualifying hedges and repeals the preferential dividend rule for public reits previously applicable to us lastly the act adjusts the way we may calculate certain earnings and profits calculations to avoid double taxation at the stockholder level and expands the types of qualifying assets and income for purposes of the reit requirements the provisions enacted by the act could result in changes in our tax positions or investments and future legislative changes related to those rules described above could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			our international investments and operations may result in additional taxrelated risks 		 		 			we have investments and operations in the united kingdom and may further expand internationally international expansion presents taxrelated risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not always qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit  		 			 				  			 		 			 			challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash and  		 			 				  			 		 			 			challenges of complying with foreign tax rules including the possible revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations including those governing the taxation of our international income 		 			 		  		 			28 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock 		 		 			our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and
