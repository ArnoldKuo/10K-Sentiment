rents dfl noncash interest amortization of market lease intangibles nonrefundable entrance fees and lease termination fees noncash adjustments adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as cash noi we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations to assess and compare property level performance and to evaluate our same property portfolio spp as described below we believe that net income loss is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income loss as defined by gaap since it does not reflect various excluded items further our definition of noi may not be comparable to the definition used by other reits or real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi for a reconciliation of noi and adjusted noi to net income loss by segment refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 		 		 			operating expenses generally relate to

to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 		 		 			ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit is net income loss applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property including any current and deferred taxes directly associated with sales of depreciable property impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and other depreciation and amortization and adjustments to compute our share of ffo and ffo as adjusted see below from joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our prorata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures we reflect our share of ffo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis we reflect our share for consolidated joint

financial information as a supplement ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income loss we compute ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition however other reits may report ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours 		 		 			in addition we present ffo before the impact of noncomparable items including but not limited to severancerelated charges litigation

performance as a reit at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry it also recognized that management of each of its member companies has the responsibility

performance are best served by an ffo runrate earnings measure that includes in addition to adjustments made to arrive at the nareit defined measure of ffo other adjustments to net income loss ffo as adjusted is used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand this measure used by management we use ffo as adjusted to i evaluate our performance in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv assess our performance as compared with similar real estate companies and the industry in general and v evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating an

methodologies for calculating fad and accordingly our fad may not be comparable to those reported by other reits although our fad computation may not be comparable to that of other reits management believes fad provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance and is frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit we believe fad is an alternative runrate earnings measure that improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with i expected results ii results of previous periods and iii results among reits more meaningful fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as it excludes the following items which generally flow through our cash flows from operating activities i adjustments for changes in working capital or the actual timing of the payment of income or expense items that are accrued in the period ii transactionrelated costs iii litigation provision iv severancerelated expenses and v actual cash receipts from interest income recognized on loans receivable in contrast to our fad adjustment to exclude noncash interest and depreciation related to our investments in direct financing leases furthermore fad is adjusted

unconsolidated joint ventures see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 		 			 		  		 			63 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			critical accounting policies 		 		 			the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 		 		 			  		 		 			principles of consolidation  		 		 			the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 		 		 			we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether i the equity investors as a group do not have a controlling financial interest ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support or iii substantially all of the entitys activities involve or are performed on behalf of an equity investor that holds disproportionately few voting rights we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entitys governing body the size and seniority of our investment and our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a reanalysis of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the vie our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 		 		 			if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie we would require the vie to provide us timely financial information and would review the internal controls of the vie to determine if we could rely on the financial information it provides if the vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting 		 		 			  		 		 			revenue recognition 		 		 			at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying propertys economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs is equal to 90 or more of the excess estimated fair value over retained tax credits of the leased asset if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease if the assumptions utilized in the above classifications assessments were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus  		  		 			64 		   		 			table of contents 		 the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of a tenant improvement is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 		 		 			certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent is dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for operating lease straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent receivable amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of future minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unamortized unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment if these assessments were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 		 		 			loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans if management determined that certain loans should no longer be classified as heldforinvestment the timing and amount of our interest income recognized would be impacted 		 		 			loans receivable and dfls collectively finance receivables are reviewed and assigned an internal rating of performing watch list or workout finance receivables that are deemed performing meet all present contractual obligations and collection and timing of all amounts owed is reasonably assured watch list finance receivables are defined as finance receivables that do not meet the definition of performing or workout workout finance receivables are defined as finance receivables in which we have determined based on current information and events that i it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement ii the tenant operator or borrower is delinquent on making payments under the contractual terms of the agreement iii and we have commenced action or anticipate pursuing action in the near term to seek recovery of our investment 		 		 			 		  		 			65 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured the asset will have an internal rating of either watch list or workout further we perform a credit analysis to support the tenants operators borrowers andor guarantors repayment capacity and the underlying collateral values we use the cash basis method of accounting for finance receivables placed on nonaccrual status unless one of the following conditions exist whereby we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting i if we determine that it is probable that we will only recover the recorded investment in the finance receivable net of associated allowances or chargeoffs if any or ii we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of an impaired finance receivable for cash basis method of accounting we apply payments received excluding principal paydowns to interest income so long as that amount does not exceed the amount that would have been earned under the original contractual terms for cost recovery method of accounting any payment received is applied to reduce the recorded investment generally we return a finance receivable to accrual status when all delinquent payments become current under the terms of the loan or lease agreements and collectibility of the remaining contractual loan or lease payments is reasonably assured 		 		 			allowances are established for finance receivables on an individual basis utilizing an estimate of probable losses if they are determined to be impaired finance receivables are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessees or borrowers overall financial condition economic resources payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivables effective interest rate fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors as appropriate should a finance receivable be deemed partially or wholly uncollectible the uncollectible balance is charged off against the allowance in the period in which the uncollectible determination has been made 		 		 			  		 		 			real estate 		 		 			we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of allocating fair value to inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases 		 		 			a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project to be considered substantially complete and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 		 		 			 		  		 			66 		   		 			table of contents 		  		 		 			  		 		 			impairment of longlived assets  		 		 			we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be recoverable but at least annually recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 		 		 			the determination of the fair value of real estate assets involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results resulting cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 		 		 			  		 		 			investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 		 		 			the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment indicators based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at
