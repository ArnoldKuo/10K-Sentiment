redevelopments iv investment management and v investments in senior housing operations utilizing the structure permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 which is commonly referred to as ridea   the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the following   compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services  specialized nature of healthcare real estate

expenditures are projected to grow 38 in 2013 and 74 in 2014 ii the average compounded annual growth rate for national health expenditures over the projection period of 2015 through 2021 is anticipated to be 62 and iii the healthcare industry is projected to represent 178 of us gdp in 2013   senior citizens are the largest consumers of healthcare services according to cms on a per capita basis the 75year and older segment of the population spends 76 more on healthcare than the 65 to 74yearold segment and over 200 more than the population average  3      table of contents      us population over 65 years old      source us census bureau the statistical abstract of the united states   business strategy   our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth which allows us to maintain or increase dividends per share to our shareholders our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing    opportunistic investing    we make investment decisions that are expected to drive profitable growth and create shareholder value we attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of situations to meet our goals and investment criteria    portfolio diversification    we believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare investments diversified by segment geography operator tenant and investment product we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment product geographic location the number of properties which we may lease to a single operator or tenant or loans we may make to a single borrower with investments in multiple segments and investment products we can focus on opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for the portfolio as a whole we may structure transactions as master leases require operator or tenant insurance and indemnifications obtain credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits and take other measures to mitigate risk    conservative financing    we believe a conservative balance sheet is important to our ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach we strive to maintain a conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debttoequity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit facility access to capital markets and secured debt lenders relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners and our ability to divest of assets our debt obligations are primarily fixed rate with staggered maturities which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations   we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing through offerings of  4      table of contents equity and debt securities placement of mortgage debt and capital from other institutional lenders and equity investors   we specifically incorporate by reference into this section the information set forth in item 7 2012 transaction overview included elsewhere in this report   competition   investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies pension funds private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends   income from our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with other companies on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and the financial condition of our tenants and operators private federal and state payment programs as well as the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see risk

our senior housing facilities are leased to single tenants under triplenet lease structures senior housing facilities include assisted living facilities alfs independent living facilities ilfs and continuing care retirement communities ccrcs which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs services provided by our operators or tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicaid and medicare our senior housing property types are further described below    assisted living facilities alfs are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services support and housing for those who need help with activities of daily living adl such as bathing eating and dressing yet require limited medical care the programs and services may include transportation social activities exercise and fitness programs beauty or barber shop access hobby and craft activities community excursions meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents these facilities are often in apartmentlike buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments certain alfs may offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents requiring memory care as a result of alzheimers disease or other forms of dementia levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations at december 31 2012 we had interests in 363 alfs   independent living facilities ilfs are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as housekeeping meals and activities these residents generally do not need assistance with adl however in some of our   5      table of contents   facilities residents have the option to contract for these services at december 31 2012 we had interests in 64 ilfs    continuing care retirement communities ccrcs provide housing and healthrelated services under longterm contracts this alternative is appealing to residents as it eliminates the need for relocating when health and medical needs change thus allowing residents to age in place some ccrcs require a substantial entry or buyin fee and most also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit meals and some health services ccrcs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry at december 31 2012 we had interests in 14 ccrcs    during the

includes revenues earned from both our medical office and hospital segments   investment products   properties under lease we primarily generate revenue by leasing properties under longterm leases most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triplenet leases or leases that provide for a substantial recovery of operating expenses however some of our mobs and life science facility rents are structured under gross or modified gross leases accordingly for such gross or modified gross leases we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities and insurance   our ability to grow income from properties under lease depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels ii maximize tenant recoveries and iii control nonrecoverable operating expenses most of our leases include contractual annual base rent escalation clauses that are either predetermined fixed increases andor are a function of an inflation index   debt investments our mezzanine loans are generally secured by a pledge of

more than 25 of acquisition cost or existing basis to update achieve stabilization or to change the primary use of the properties   investment management we coinvest in real estate properties with institutional investors through joint ventures structured as partnerships or limited liability companies we target institutional investors with longterm investment horizons who seek to benefit from our expertise in healthcare real estate predominantly we retain noncontrolling interests in the joint ventures ranging from 20 to 30 and serve as the managing member these ventures generally allow us to earn acquisition and asset management fees and have the potential for promoted interests or incentive distributions based on performance of the joint venture   operating properties ridea we may enter into contracts with healthcare operators to manage communities that are placed in a structure permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 commonly referred to as ridea under the provisions of ridea a reit may lease qualified healthcare properties on an arms length basis to a taxable reit subsidiary trs if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an eligible independent contractor we view ridea as a structure primarily to be used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points and to drive growth by i transitioning the asset to a new operator that can bring scale operating efficiencies andor ancillary services or ii investing capital to reposition the asset   portfolio summary   at december 31 2012 we managed

december 31 2012 we had 149 fulltime employees none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement   government regulation licensing and enforcement    overview    our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices government reimbursement licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wideranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws and regulations and reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and  10      table of contents operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under risk factors in item 1a   based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators excluding our medical office segment at december 31 2012 we estimate that approximately 18 and 14 of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement respectively   the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us    fraud and abuse enforcement    there are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs ii federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the stark law which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v federal and state privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws    reimbursement    sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among other sources governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare program and state medicaid programs and nongovernmental payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government and many states face significant budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators    healthcare licensure and certificate of need    certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion and closure of certain healthcare facilities the  11      table of contents approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants and operators abilities to expand or change their businesses    life science facilities    while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other such tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and money in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance    senior housing entrance fee communities    certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facilitys financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters    americans with disabilities act the ada    our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect    environmental matters    a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owners or secured lenders liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our revenues for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see risk factors in item 1a of this report  12                   table of contents       item 1a risk factors    the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  as set forth below we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following categories   risks related to our business and  risks related to tax matters including reitrelated risks    risks related to our business   volatility or disruption in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities   the global financial markets recently have experienced pervasive and fundamental disruptions while these conditions have stabilized since the first quarter of 2009 and the capital markets generally have shown signs of improvement the sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain and additional levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities   market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures that may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings   we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and limitations on our access to such capital could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business   we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations if we are unable to obtain enough internal capital we may need to rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements if we cannot access these external sources of capital we may not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business and to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature our access to capital depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including but not limited to   general availability of credit and market conditions including rising interest rates and increased borrowing cost   the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and preferred securities   the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions   our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility  the financial integrity of our lenders which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms or at all  the stability in the market value of our properties   13      table of contents   the financial performance and general market perception of our operators tenants and borrowers   changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the united states of its obligations and  issues facing the healthcare industry including but not limited to healthcare reform and changes in government reimbursement policies    if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to fund operations refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire properties and development activities   adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and negatively impact the market price of our securities including our common stock   the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments also a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments   our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations   our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2012 was approximately 87 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed   covenants related to our indebtedness limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   our unsecured credit facilities unsecured debt securities and secured debt and other indebtedness that we may incur in the future require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining certain levels of debt service coverage and leverage ratio tangible net worth requirements and maintaining reit status our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties  14      table of contents and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee additionally defaults under the leases or operating agreements related to mortgaged properties including defaults associated with the bankruptcy of the applicable tenant or operator may result in a default under the underlying mortgage and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   an increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell assets and limit our acquisition investment and development activities   if interest rates increase so could our interest costs for any new debt this increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions   we depend on a limited number of operators and tenants that account for a large percentage of our revenues   during the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 48 of our revenues were generated by our leasing or financial arrangements with the following four companies hcr manorcare 30 emeritus 8 sunrise 5 and brookdale 5 the failure inability or unwillingness of these operators or tenants to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay cause our stock price to decline and have other material adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition   in addition any failure by these operators or tenants to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition these operators and tenants generally have also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and we cannot provide any assurance that they will have sufficient assets income access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its indemnification obligations   economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 44 of our revenue was derived from properties located in california 22 texas 12 and florida 10 as a result we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions increased competition or decreased demand and changes in statespecific legislation which could adversely affect our business and results of operations   the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or tenants may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to thirdparty tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the  15      table of contents properties although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict an operator or tenant or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition the inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators in addition under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in crossdefault under our other indebtedness although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of an applicable operator or tenant may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences in addition many of our facilities are leased to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may be a difficult and slow process and may not be successful   our operators and tenants may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses   our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us as well as the tenants and operators some types of losses may not be adequately insured by our tenants and operators should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry however we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses or losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future   our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs   in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the operators and tenants of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our operators and tenants for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits allegedly arising from the actions of our operators or tenants for which claims such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against but which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part  16      table of contents  operators and tenants that fail to comply with the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us   certain of our operators and tenants are affected by an extremely complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and substantial changes sometimes applied retroactively resulting from legislation adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law see item 1businessgovernment regulation licensing and enforcement above for example to the extent that any of our operators or tenants receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to   statutory and regulatory changes  retroactive rate adjustments  recovery of program overpayments or setoffs  administrative rulings  policy interpretations  payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers  government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and   interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such property    in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to budgetary pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our operators and tenants costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our operators or tenants to comply with these laws requirements and regulations could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us   legislation to address the federal governments projected operating deficit could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations   congress may consider legislation to address the fiscal condition of the united states that may include entitlement reform tax reform reductions in domestic discretionary spending budget sequestration of certain nondefense discretionary federal programs and an increase in the national debt limit that could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations in particular congress may consider legislation affecting the funding of entitlement programs such as medicare medicaid and medicare advantage plans that may result in reductions in funding and reimbursements to providers tax reform that may impact corporate and individual tax rates and retirement plans and an increase in the federal debt limit that may have an impact on credit markets additionally the administration may implement proposals under current law or legislation that may be approved by congress that could modify the delivery of services and benefits under medicare medicaid or medicare advantage plans such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us  17      table of contents  operators and tenants that fail to comply with federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us   certain of our operators and tenants are subject to extensive federal state local and industryrelated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards our operators or tenants failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs loss of license or closure of the facility for example certain of our properties may require a license registration andor certificate of need to operate failure of any operator or tenant to obtain a license registration or certificate of need or loss of a required license registration or certificate of need would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by such operator or tenant additionally failure of our operators and tenants to generally comply with applicable laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore may materially adversely impact us see item 1businessgovernment regulation licensing and enforcementhealthcare licensure and certificate of need above   increased competition as well as an inability to grow revenues as originally forecast have resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our operators and tenants and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us   the healthcare industry is highly competitive and can become more competitive in the future the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities is dependent on our ability and the ability of our operators and tenants to maintain and increase such levels and income and to compete with entities that have substantial capital resources these entities compete with other operators and tenants on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of the properties and their tenants our operators and tenants also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers such competition which has intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that the operators and tenants of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our operators and tenants thus our operators and tenants may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets and increasing our collection and dispute costs   our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty   life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain unique risks as follows   some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research development and clinical testing of their products and technologies if private investors the government or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such activities a tenants business may be adversely affected or fail   18      table of contents   the research development clinical testing manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants products require federal state and foreign regulatory approvals which may be costly or difficult to obtain  even after a life science tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance the product may still present significant regulatory and liability risks including among others the possible later discovery of safety concerns competition from new products and ultimately the expiration of patent protection for the product  our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors and  our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent copyright or trade secret laws    we cannot assure you that our life science tenants will be successful in their businesses if our tenants businesses are adversely affected they may have difficulty making payments to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate occupy or reposition the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments   if an operator or tenant defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the propertys investment potential in some cases as noted above the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating facilities and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity operators tenants or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure and we may be required to record valuation allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously seek tenants or operators if at all which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment   required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities   transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility if we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take possession of a facility which might expose us to successor liability or require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses all of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  19      table of contents  competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio   we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected   we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other operators and tenants   healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific a new or replacement operator or tenant may require different features in a property depending on that operators or tenants particular operations if a current operator or tenant is unable to pay rent and vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another operator or tenant also if the property needs to be renovated to accommodate multiple operators or tenants we may incur substantial expenditures before we are able to release the space these expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  20                   table of contents   we face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken   largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that   a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred  the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and higher materials transportation labor leasing or other costs which could make the completion of the development project less profitable  construction andor permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all   the project may not be completed on schedule which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters labor conditions material shortages regulatory hurdles civil unrest and acts of war and   occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable    these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and under certain circumstances could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments   we have and may continue in the future to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including   we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decisionmaking authority which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes including litigation or arbitration  our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives including the timing terms and strategies for any investments  our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted   our joint venture partners might become bankrupt fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital and   our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues    from time to time we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected   acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with  21      table of contents acquisitions include the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities including   liabilities relating to the cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions   unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller  liabilities claims and litigation whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business relating to periods prior to our acquisition  claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the seller and   liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition    in addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   from time to time we have made and in the future we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds   we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize shareholder value and believe that currently there are available a number of acquisition opportunities that would be complementary to our business given the recent industry consolidation trend in connection with our review of such transactions we regularly engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates some of which are material any future acquisitions could require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures any of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all   loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us   we are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers and competition for these individuals is intense although our chief executive officer chief financial officer chief investment officer and general counsel have employment agreements with us we cannot assure you that they will remain employed with us the loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and be negatively perceived in the capital markets   unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition   from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators and tenants in which such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses an unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our  22      table of contents business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of litigation in addition litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations   we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property decrease anticipated future revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expense   we maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we continually review the insurance maintained by us however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters and may be subject to other losses in particular our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity while we purchase insurance for earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants there is no assurance that such insurance will fully cover such losses these losses can decrease our anticipated revenues from a property and result in the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future in addition there are certain exposures where insurance is not purchased as we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market   environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate related investments may materially impair the value of those investments   under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations as a current or previous owner of real estate we may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination although we i currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable and ii generally require our operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral as the owner of a site we may also be held liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site although we are generally indemnified by the current operators or tenants of our properties for contamination caused by them these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us   the impact of the comprehensive healthcare regulation enacted in 2010 on us and operators and tenants cannot accurately be predicted   legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures each year that would affect major changes in the healthcare system either nationally or at the state level  23      table of contents notably in march 2010 president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the affordable care act the passage of the affordable care act has resulted in comprehensive reform legislation that is expected to expand healthcare coverage to millions of currently uninsured people beginning in 2014 and provide for significant changes to the us healthcare system over the next ten years to help fund this expansion the affordable care act outlines certain reductions in medicare reimbursements for various healthcare providers including longterm acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as well as certain other changes to medicare payment methodologies this comprehensive healthcare legislation provides for extensive future rulemaking by regulatory authorities and also may be altered or amended we cannot accurately predict whether any pending legislative proposals will be adopted or if adopted what effect if any these proposals would have on our operators and tenants and thus our business similarly while we can anticipate that some of the rulemaking that will be promulgated by regulatory authorities will affect our operators and tenants and the manner in which they are reimbursed by the federal healthcare programs we cannot accurately predict today the impact of those regulations on our operators and tenants and thus on our business   the supreme courts decision upholding the constitutionality of the individual mandate while striking down the provisions linking federal funding of state medicaid programs with a federally mandated expansion of those programs has not reduced the uncertain impact that the law will have on healthcare delivery systems over the next decade we can expect that the federal authorities will continue to implement the law but because of the courts mixed ruling the implementation will take longer than originally expected with a commensurate increase in the period of uncertainty regarding the laws full long term financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare   risk related to tax including reitrelated risks   loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have material adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock   qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit   if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit   we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income   we will be subject to corporatelevel income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates   24      table of contents   we could be subject to increased state and local income taxes and  unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a reit    as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock   we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties   if during the tenyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties   in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any   there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits eampp in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute eampp   in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit eampp of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such eampp distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such eampp distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such eampp distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of eampp including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit eampp moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit eampp which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit   thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit eampp by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our eampp we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so   our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock   our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended

in the future the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons   in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the maryland business combination act our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in certain circumstances business combinations including a merger or

principles gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain    principles of consolidation    the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie at i the inception of the variable interest entity ii as a result of a change in circumstance identified during our continuous review of our vie relationships or iii upon the occurrence of a qualifying reconsideration event   we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entitys governing body the size and seniority of our investment our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie  41      table of contents affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements if we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the variable interest entity our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary   if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie either tenant or borrower rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie we would depend on the vie to provide us timely financial information and rely on the internal control of the vie to provide accurate financial information if the vie has deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting    revenue recognition    we recognize rental revenue on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset for assets acquired subject to leases we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements for accounting purposes are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted   certain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements   we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on an ongoing basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements   loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans   we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable the difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the  42      table of contents properties is recorded as unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured investments in dfls are presented net of unamortized unearned income the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment if our assessments for accounting purposes were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted   loans and dfls are placed on nonaccrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured while on nonaccrual status loans or dfls are either accounted for on a cash basis in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash or on a costrecovery basis in which all cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or dfl based on managements judgment of collectibility   allowances are established for loans and dfls based upon a probable loss estimate for individual loans and dfls deemed to be impaired loans and dfls are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrowers or lessees overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans or dfls effective interest rate the fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors while our assumptions are based in part upon historical data our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements    real estate    we make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component the most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the value of inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases   a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements  43      table of contents   impairment of longlived assets and goodwill    we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models quoted market values and third party appraisals where considered necessary if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset   goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually if it is determined based on certain qualitative factors that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we apply the twostep approach certain qualitative factors assessed by us include current macroeconomic conditions state of the equity and capital markets and the overall financial and operating performance of hcp if we qualitatively determine that it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the twostep approach is necessary   if the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its carrying value then the second step of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment the second step requires the fair value of a reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment we estimate the current fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques including applying capitalization rates to segment net operating income quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals as necessary the fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company   the determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units and the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results    investments in unconsolidated joint ventures    investments in entities which we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting our share of the investees earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations   the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary of investments in unconsolidated joint  44      table of contents ventures involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of the fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results    income taxes    as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential for builtingain recognized related to priortaxfree acquisitions of c corporations and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision   results of operations   we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments i senior housing ii postacuteskilled nursing iii life science iv medical office and v hospital under the senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital segments we invest or coinvest primarily in single operator or tenant properties through the acquisition and development of real estate management of operations and by debt issued by operators in these sectors under the medical office segment we invest or coinvest through the acquisition and development of mobs that are leased under gross modified gross or triplenet leases generally to multiple tenants and which generally require a greater level of property management the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements   we use net operating income noi and adjusted noi to assess and compare property level performance including our same property portfolio spp and to make decisions about resource allocations we believe these measures provide investors relevant and useful information because they reflect only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and present them on an unleveraged basis we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by gaap since noi excludes certain components from net income further noi may not be comparable to that of other reits as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional segment information and the relevant reconciliations from net income to noi and adjusted noi   operating expenses are generally related to mob and life science leased properties and senior housing properties managed on our behalf ridea properties we generally recover all or a portion of mob and life science expenses from the tenants tenant recoveries the presentation of expenses as operating or general and administrative is based on the underlying nature of the expense periodically we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expenses   our evaluation of results of operations by each business segment includes an analysis of our spp and our total property portfolio spp information allows us to evaluate the performance of our leased property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties we identify our spp as stabilized properties that remained in operations and  45      table of contents were consistently reported as leased properties or ridea properties for the duration of the yearoveryear comparison periods presented accordingly it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure to be included in our spp newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup typically when the tenants controls the physical use of at least 80 of the space or 12 months from the acquisition date newly completed developments including redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service spp noi excludes certain nonproperty specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis   comparison of the year ended december 31 2012 to the year ended december 31 2011

respectively to the consolidated financial statements for additional information   interest expense for the year ended december 31 2012 interest expense increased 734000 to 417 million the increase

general and administrative expenses decreased 17 million to 79 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the decrease was primarily due to an insurance recovery of 7 million during 2012 for

during the year ended december 31 2011 for an otherthantemporary impairment of marketable equity securities   income taxes for the year ended december 31 2012 income taxes decreased 3 million to a benefit of 2 million the decrease in income taxes was primarily due to the tax benefit resulting from declines in taxable income of our trs entities during the year ended december 31 2012   equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily the result of our 94 equity interest in hcr manorcare the october 2011 cms reduction of skilled nursing reimbursements under resource utilization groupversion 4 rugsiv together with changes in requirements for the delivery of group therapy services reduced hcr manorcares revenues and increased its therapy costs in 2012 hcr manorcare partially mitigated these adverse impacts through a cost reduction program further hcr manorcare experienced increased exposure to general and professional

compared to 29 million for the comparable period in 2010 the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in gains on real estate dispositions of 17 million and a decline in operating income from discontinued operations of 5 million during the year ended december 31 2011 we sold properties for 19 million compared to 56 million for the year ended december 31 2010   liquidity and capital resources   our principal liquidity needs are to i fund recurring operating expenses ii meet debt service requirements including 550 million of senior unsecured notes and 292 million of mortgage debt principal payments and maturities in 2013 iii fund capital expenditures including tenant improvements and leasing costs iv fund acquisition and development activities and v make dividend distributions we anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next 12 months will be adequate to fund our business operations debt service payments recurring capital expenditures and cash dividends

facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon our debt ratings we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our debt ratings as of february 11 2013 we had a credit rating of bbb from fitch baa1 from moodys and bbb from sampp on our senior unsecured debt securities   net cash provided by operating activities was 1 billion and 724 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of the following i the additive impact of our acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 ii assets placed in service in 2011 and 2012 and iii rent escalations and resets in 2011 and 2012 which increases were partially offset by increased debt interest payments our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multitenant buildings rental rates on leases our tenants performance on their lease obligations the level of operating expenses and other factors   the following are significant investing and financing activities for the year ended december 31 2012   acquired 19 billion of real estate including the 17 billion blackstone jv acquisition   purchased 215 million 137 million of senior unsecured notes and funded 219 million of loans  raised 35 billion of debt and equity capital to fund among other things the aforementioned investments repay debt totaling 860 million and redeem preferred securities for 296 million and  paid dividends on common and preferred stock of 865 million which are generally funded by cash provided by our operating activities     debt    bank line of credit and term loan on march 27 2012 we executed an amendment to our existing 15 billion unsecured revolving line of credit facility the facility this amendment reduces the cost of the facility lower borrowing rate and facility fee and extends the facilitys maturity by one additional year to march 2016 the facility contains a oneyear extension option borrowings under this facility accrue interest at libor plus a margin that depends upon our debt ratings we pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends on our debt ratings based on our debt ratings at february 11 2013 the margin on the facility was 1075 and the facility fee was 0175 the facility also includes a feature that will allow us to increase the borrowing capacity by an aggregate amount of up to 500 million subject to securing additional commitments from existing lenders or new lending institutions   on july 30 2012 we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a 137 million 223 million at december 31 2012 fouryear unsecured term loan the term loan that accrues interest at a rate of gbp libor plus 120 based on our current debt ratings concurrent with the closing of the term loan we entered into a fouryear interest rate swap agreement that fixed the rate of the term loan at 181 subject to adjustments based on our credit ratings the term loan contains a oneyear committed extension option   our facility and term loan contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements among other things these covenants using terms defined in the agreements i limit the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total asset value to 60 ii limit the ratio  61      table of contents of secured debt to consolidated total asset value to 30 iii limit the ratio of unsecured debt to consolidated unencumbered asset value to 60 iv require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 15 times and v require a formuladetermined minimum consolidated tangible net worth of 92 billion at december 31 2012 at december 31 2012 we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the facility and term loan   our facility also contains crossdefault provisions to other indebtedness of ours including in some instances certain mortgages on our properties certain mortgages contain default provisions relating to defaults under the leases or operating agreements on the applicable properties by our operators or tenants including default provisions relating to the bankruptcy filings of such operator or tenant although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements if a default as described above occurs such a default may result in significantly less favorable borrowing terms than currently available material delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences   senior unsecured notes at december 31 2012 we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of 67 billion interest rates on the notes ranged from 121 to 707 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 510 and a weighted average maturity of six years at december 31 2012 the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt maintenance of unencumbered assets crossacceleration provisions and other customary terms at december 31 2012 we believe we were in compliance with these covenants   mortgage debt at december 31 2012 we had 17 billion in aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding that is secured by 135 healthcare facilities including redevelopment properties with a carrying value of 21 billion interest rates on the mortgage debt ranged from 154 to 869 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 613 and a weighted average maturity of four years at december 31 2012   mortgage debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments is collateralized by certain properties and is generally nonrecourse mortgage debt typically restricts transfer of the encumbered properties prohibits additional liens restricts prepayment requires payment of real estate taxes requires maintenance of the assets in good condition requires maintenance of insurance on the assets and includes conditions to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases some of the mortgage debt is also crosscollateralized by multiple properties and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such real estate assets   other debt at december 31 2012 we had 82 million of noninterest bearing life care bonds at two of our

operations ffo   we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and basic and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue   ffo is defined as net income applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from acquisition and dispositions of depreciable real estate or related interests impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and dfl depreciation and amortization with adjustments for joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income we compute ffo in accordance with the current national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition however other reits may report ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from us in addition we present ffo before the impact of litigation settlement charges preferred stock redemption charges impairments recoveries of nondepreciable assets and mergerrelated items defined below ffo as adjusted management believes ffo as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement this measure is a modification of the nareit definition of ffo and should not

debt is calculated using rates in effect at december 31 2012   inflation   our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants operating revenues most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above   recent accounting pronouncements   see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards there were no accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us that we believe will materially impact our consolidated financial statements       item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk    we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information   to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates the estimated change  67      table of contents in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 8 million see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis details   interest rate risk at december 31 2012 we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on properties with a gross value of 83 million that are subject to leases where the payments fluctuate with changes in libor excludes 223 million of variablerate senior unsecured notes that have been hedged through interestrate swap contracts our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variablerate investments is partially offset by i 25 million of variablerate senior unsecured notes and ii 15 million of variablerate mortgage debt payable excludes 86 million of variablerate mortgage notes that have been hedged through interestrate swap contracts additionally our exposure to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates excludes our gbp denominated 223 million 137 million variablerate term loan that has been hedged through interestrate swap contracts   interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate investments and variablerate debt and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2012 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 03 million or less than 001 per common share on a diluted basis   foreign currency exchange rate risk at december 31 2012 our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates to forecasted interest receipts from our gbp denominated senior unsecured notes see additional discussion of the four seasons health care senior unsecured notes in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements our foreign currency exchange exposure is mitigated by the forecasted interest and principal payments from our gbp denominated unsecured term loan see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information and a foreign currency swap contract for approximately 85 of the forecasted interest receipts from our senior unsecured notes through the noncall period which ends on june 15 2016   market risk we have investments in marketable debt securities classified as heldtomaturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through

policies    use of estimates    management is required to make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from managements estimates    principles of consolidation    the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp its whollyowned subsidiaries and joint ventures or variable interest entities that it controls through voting rights or other means all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation   the company is required to continually evaluate its vie relationships and consolidate these entities when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of their operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support   a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie the company qualitatively assesses whether it is or is not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to the companys ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance its form of ownership interest its representation on the vies governing body the size and seniority of its investment its ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions and its ability to replace the manager of andor liquidate the entity   for its investments in joint ventures the company evaluates the type of ownership rights held by the limited partners that may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership the assessment of limited partners rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership interests or iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests the company similarly evaluates the rights of managing members of limited

possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements the company determines whether the tenant improvements for accounting purposes are owned by the tenant or the company when the company is the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance that is funded by the company is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including but not limited to the following criteria   whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent   whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term   whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or generalpurpose in nature and   whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease term    certain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds and only after the contingency has been removed when the related thresholds are achieved this may result in the recognition of rental revenue in periods subsequent to when such payments are received   tenant recoveries related to the reimbursement of real estate taxes insurance repairs and maintenance and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred the reimbursements are recognized and presented gross as the company is generally the primary obligor and with respect to purchasing goods and services from thirdparty suppliers has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the associated credit risk   for leases with minimum scheduled rent increases the company recognizes income on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured recognizing rental income on a straightline basis for leases results in recognized revenue amounts which differ from those that are contractually due from tenants if the company determines that collectibility of straightline rents is not reasonably assured the company limits future recognition to amounts contractually owed and paid and when appropriate establishes an allowance for estimated losses   resident fee revenue is recorded when services are rendered and includes resident room and care charges community fees and other resident charges residency agreements are generally for a term of 30 days to one year with resident fees billed monthly revenue for certain care related services is recognized as services are provided and is billed monthly in arrears   the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments the company monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants and operators on an ongoing basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent amounts the companys assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease  f9      table of contents  hcp inc   notes to consolidated financial statements

the company is not obligated to perform additional activities that may be considered significant the initial investment from the buyer is sufficient and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied gain on sales of real estate may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition have been met   allowances are established for loans and dfls based upon an estimate of probable losses for the individual loans and dfls deemed to be impaired loans and dfls are impaired when it is deemed probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease an allowance is based upon the companys assessment of the borrowers or lessees overall financial condition economic resources and payment

connection with the redevelopment costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisitions or developments are charged to earnings expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred the company considers costs incurred in conjunction with releasing properties including tenant improvements and lease commissions to represent the acquisition of productive assets and

include a significant decline in real estate valuations restructuring plans current macroeconomic conditions state of the equity and capital markets or a significant decline in the value of the companys market capitalization the second step of the twostep approach requires the fair value of a reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had

are unobservable    the company measures fair value using a set of standardized procedures that are outlined herein for all assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value when available the company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third party source to determine fair value and classifies such items in level 1 in some instances where a market price is available but the instrument is in an inactive or overthecounter market the company consistently applies the dealer market maker pricing estimate and classifies the asset or liability in level 2   if quoted market prices or inputs are not available fair value measurements are based upon valuation models that utilize current market or independently sourced market inputs such as interest rates option volatilities credit spreads andor market capitalization rates items valued using such internallygenerated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a result the asset or liability could be classified in either level 2 or level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable internal fair value models and techniques used by the company include discounted cash flow and blackscholes valuation models the company also considers its counterpartys and own credit risk

rights was 41 million the company had marketed for lease the 27 communities to a limited group of operators and prior to august 31 2010 had received a favorable bid and an executed nonbinding term sheet from emeritus corporation emeritus on october 18 2010 the company executed two triplenet master leases with emeritus for the 27 communities on terms consistent with a nonbinding term sheet agreed to by the company and emeritus in august 2010 including fixed lease terms of 15 years and two 10 year extension options shortly thereafter on october 31 2010 the company exercised its rights under the existing lease contracts to terminate the leases with the tenants that had entered into the management contracts with sunrise for a payment of 2 million the term of the new emeritus leases commenced on november 1 2010 immediately after such termination   the company capitalized the 41 million cost for the above termination rights as an initial direct leasing cost of the new leases as it determined that i acquiring the right to terminate sunrises longterm management contracts was essential to enable the company to lease such communities to another operator and ii prior to august 31 2010 the leasing transaction with emeritus was reasonably assured the initial direct leasing costs will be amortized over the initial 15year term of the new leases with emeritus further the company concluded that no amount of the 50 million paid to sunrise should be allocated to the dismissed litigation or to the existing leases on the 48 remaining communities because the company believed that i as ruled by the virginia district court sunrises counterclaims lacked merit and had no value and the claims remaining in the chancery court arose from similar facts and were expected to be decided on the basis of similar law ii sunrises agreement to limit certain fees on the remaining 48 communities and the companys agreement to fund certain capital expenditures at the communities were each consistent with the companys and sunrises obligations respectively under the existing agreements and iii the incremental value gained by the reasonably assured future rents from emeritus and the acquired working capital exceeded the payment to sunrise  f35      table of contents  hcp inc   notes to consolidated financial statements continued    concentration of credit risk    concentrations

administrative expenses litigation settlement impairments impairment recoveries other income net income taxes equity income from and impairments of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and

presents them on an unleveraged basis adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline rents dfl accretion amortization of above and below market lease intangibles and lease termination fees adjusted noi is sometimes referred to as cash noi the company uses noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property level performance the company believes that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by gaap because it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items further the companys definition of noi may not be comparable to the definition used by other reits as those companies may
