			we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments i senior housing ii postacuteskilled nursing iii life science iv medical office and v hospital under the medical office segment we invest through the acquisition and development of mobs which generally require a greater level of property management otherwise we primarily invest through the acquisition and development of real estate in single tenants and operators occupied properties and debt issued by tenants and operators in these sectors the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 		 		 			nongaap financial measures 		 		 			same property portfolio 		 		 			our evaluation of results of operations by each business segment includes an analysis of noi and adjusted noi of our same property portfolio spp and our total property portfolio we believe noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an  		 		  		 			37 		   		 			table of contents 		  		unleveraged basis we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property level performance spp noi and adjusted noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties we identify our spp as stabilized properties that remained in operations and were consistently reported as leased properties or ridea properties for the duration of the yearoveryear comparison periods presented accordingly it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure to be included in our spp newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup typically when the tenants controls the physical use of at least 80 of the space or 12 months from the acquisition date newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service spp noi excludes certain nonproperty specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis a property is removed from our spp when it is sold or placed into redevelopment noi and adjusted noi are nongaap supplemental financial measures for a reconciliation of net income to noi and adjusted noi and other relevant disclosure refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 		 		 			operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties and senior housing ridea properties we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense periodically we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expenses 		 		 			funds from operations  		 		 			we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 		 		 			ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit is net income applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and dfl depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income we compute ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition however other reits may report ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours  		 		 			in addition we present ffo before the impact of severancerelated charges litigation settlement charges preferred stock redemption charges impairments recoveries of nondepreciable assets and transactionrelated items defined below ffo as adjusted transactionrelated items include acquisition and pursuit costs eg due diligence and closing and gainscharges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo runrate this measure is a modification of the nareit definition of ffo and should not be used as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap or nareit ffo 		 		 			funds available for distribution  		 		 			fad is defined as ffo as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following i amortization of acquired market lease intangibles net ii amortization of deferred compensation expense iii amortization of deferred financing costs net iv straightline rents v accretion and depreciation related to dfls and vi deferred revenues effective 2014 excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements ownedrecognized by us and upfront cash payments made by tenants to reduce their contractual rents also fad is i computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements and ii includes lease restructure payments and adjustments to compute our share of fad from our unconsolidated joint ventures  		 		  		 			38 		   		 			table of contents 		  		and those related to ccrc nonrefundable entrance fees other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating fad and accordingly our fad may not be comparable to those reported by other reits although our fad computation may not be comparable to that of other reits management believes fad provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our ability to fund our ongoing dividend payments in addition management believes that in order to further understand and analyze our liquidity fad should not be compared with net cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap and presented in our consolidated financial statements fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and fad should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of our liquidity 		 		 			net operating income noi 		 		 			noi and adjusted noi are nongaap supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate noi is defined as rental and related revenues including tenant recoveries resident fees and services and income from dfls less property level operating expense noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income as presented in note14 to the consolidated financial statements management believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline rents dfl accretion amortization of market lease intangibles and lease termination fees adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as cash noi we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property level performance we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by gaap because it does not reflect various excluded items further our definition of noi may not be comparable to the definition used by other reits or real estate companies as those companies may use different methodologies for calculating noi 		 		 			comparison of the year ended december 31 2014 to the year ended december 31 2013 		 		 			overview1 		 		 			results are for the

increased primarily as a result of annual rent escalations from our hcrmc dfl investments 		 		 			hcrmc equity method and dfl investments  on december 19 2014 we concluded that our 94 equity ownership interest in hcrmc was otherthantemporarily impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of 36 million or 008 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014 the impairment charge reduced the carrying amount of our equity investment in hcrmc to 39 million we made this conclusion principally based on the receipt and review of hcrmcs preliminary base financial forecast for 2015 together with hcrmcs yeartodate operating results through november 2014 hcrmcs preliminary base financial forecast and operating results primarily reflected a continued shift in patient payor sources from medicare to medicare advantage which negatively impacts reimbursement rates and length of stay for hcrmcs skilled nursing segment hcrmc has indicated that its 2015 preliminary base financial forecast does not include the effect of any dispositions acquisitions or other initiatives hcrmc may undertake to improve financial performance in 2015  		 		 			we believe that hcrmcs trailing twelvemonth fixed charge coverage tfcc ratio may continue to deteriorate over the next several quarters hcrmcs 2015 preliminary base financial forecast implies that the tfcc ratio is projected to decline to 107x at the end of 2015 compared to the tfcc ratio of 108x at the end of 2014 before the impact of 24 million of certain general and professional liability charges that hcrmc incurred in the second quarter of 2014 as noted above the tfcc ratio is calculated using hcrmcs 2015 preliminary base financial forecast that does not include the effects of any dispositions acquisitions or other initiatives hcrmc may undertake to improve financial performance in 2015  		 		 			notwithstanding these developments hcrmcs 2015 preliminary base financial forecast also indicates that hcrmc will continue to meet its contractual obligations to us under a master lease the master lease therefore we continue to believe that the collection and timing of all amounts owed by hcrmc under our master lease are reasonably assured hcrmc believes that it is favorably positioned to grow as part of the ongoing changes in the healthcare environment  		 		  		 			41 		   		 			table of contents 		  		based on discussions with the management of hcrmc and our evaluation of other industry data we note the following factors that influenced our evaluation of hcrmc i medicare rate increases of 17 and 14 took effect on october 1 2014 for the skilled nursing and hospice businesses respectively ii additional cost cutting measures were implemented in the fourth quarter of 2014 iii new facility developments and expansions will be operational in 2015 iv assisted living and hospice operations demonstrated continued growth v hcp and hcr manorcare have jointly agreed to market for sale certain nonstrategic assets that are under the master lease the purpose of the dispositions is to increase ebitdar reduce rent and improve hcrmcs tfcc however no assurances can be given that the facilities will be sold or as to the timing of the sales and vi hospital admissions are forecasted to improve in 2015 		 		 			while we remain confident in hcrmcs ongoing adjustments to their business model hcrmc has not been able to reverse the decline in their financial performance failure of hcrmc to reverse the decline in its financial performance may lead us to conclude that the collection and timing of contractual obligations or a portion thereof under the master lease may not be reasonably assured in which case we would place the hcrmc dfl or a portion thereof on nonaccrual status if we further determine that it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due under the terms of the master lease we may incur an impairment on our hcrmc dfl or a portion thereof 		 		 			life science

discussion of our interest rate risk see item 7a 		 		 			depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expenses increased 37 million to 460 million for the year ended december

			inflation 		 		 			our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants operating revenues most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the tenant or operator expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 		 		 			critical accounting policies 		 		 			the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			58 		   		 			table of contents 		  		  		 		 			principles of consolidation 		 		 			the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 		 		 			we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entitys governing body the size and seniority of our investment our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a reanalysis of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the variable interest entity our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 		 		 			if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie either tenant or borrower rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie we would require the vie to provide us timely financial information and would review the internal control of the vie to determine if we could rely on the financial information they provide if the vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting 		 		 			revenue recognition 		 		 			at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying propertys economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs are equal to 90 or more of the excess estimated fair value over retained tax credits of the leased building if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predicable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease if the assumptions utilized in the above classification assessments were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 		 		 			certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to  		 		  		 			59 		   		 			table of contents 		  		make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for operating lease straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable for leases accounted for as dfls the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured investments in dfls are presented net of unamortized unearned income the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment if these assessments were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 		 		 			loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans if management determined that certain loans should no longer be classified as held for maturity the timing and amount of our interest income recognized would be impacted 		 		 			loans and dfls are placed on nonaccrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured while on nonaccrual status loans and dfls are either accounted for on a cash basis in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash or on a costrecovery basis were cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or dfl based on managements judgment of collectibility  		 		 			allowances are established for loans and dfls based upon an estimate of probable losses on an individual basis if they are determined to be impaired loans and dfls are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrowers or lessees overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the performance of our tenants operators or borrowers the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans or dfls effective interest rate the fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors while our assumptions are based in part upon historical data our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements  		 		 			real estate 		 		 			we make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component the most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the value of inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases 		 		 		 		  		 			60 		   		 			table of contents 		  		a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 		 		 			impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 		 		 			we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be recoverable recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 		 		 			goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually based on certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount potential impairment indicators and qualitative factors include a significant decline in real estate valuations restructuring plans current macroeconomic conditions state of the equity and capital markets or a significant decline in the value of our market capitalization if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we apply the required twostep quantitative approach the quantitative procedures of the twostep approach i compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill and if necessary ii compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment if any we estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques including applying capitalization rates to segment net operating income quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals as necessary the fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company 		 		 			the determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results resulting cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 		 		 			investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 		 		 			the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment indicators based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of the fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 		 		 		 		  		 			61 		   		 			table of contents
