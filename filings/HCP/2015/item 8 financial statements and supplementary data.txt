preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from managements estimates 		 		 			principles of consolidation 		 		 			the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp its whollyowned subsidiaries and joint ventures or variable interest entities that it controls through voting rights or other means intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation 		 		 			the company is required to continually evaluate its vie relationships and consolidate these entities when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of their operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support ii substantially all of an entitys activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights or iii the equity investors as a group lack if any a the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of an entity 		 		 			a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie the company qualitatively assesses whether it is or is not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to its form of ownership interest its representation on the vies governing body the size and seniority of its investment its ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions and its ability to replace the manager of andor liquidate the entity 		 		 			for its investments in joint ventures that are not considered to be vies the company evaluates the type of ownership rights held by the limited partners that may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership the assessment of limited partners rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership interests or iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests the company similarly evaluates the rights of managing members of limited liability companies 		 		 			revenue recognition 		 		 			at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments the company assesses its terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee ii lessee has a bargain purchase option  		 		  		 			71 		   		 			table of contents 		  		during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying propertys economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs are equal to 90 or more of the excess estimated fair value over retained tax credits of the leased property if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease dfl 		 		 			the company utilizes the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured 		 		 			the company recognizes rental revenue for operating lease arrangements when the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical leased asset until the company owned tenant improvements are substantially completed if a lease arrangement provides for tenant improvements the company determines whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or the company when the company is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvements funded by the tenant are treated as lease payments which are deferred and amortized into income over the lease term when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance that is funded by the company is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term ownership of tenant improvements is determined based on various factors including but not limited to the following criteria 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			lease stipulations of how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent 		 			 				  			 		 			 			which party to the arrangement retains legal title to the tenant improvements upon lease expiration 		 			 				  			 		 			 			whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general purpose in nature and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			if the tenant improvements are expected to have significant residual value at the end of the lease term 		 			certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds and only after any contingency has been removed when the related thresholds are achieved this may result in the recognition of rental revenue in periods subsequent to when such payments are received 		 		 			tenant recoveries subject to operating leases related to the reimbursement of real estate taxes insurance repairs and maintenance and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred the reimbursements are recognized and presented gross as the company is generally the primary obligor and with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the associated credit risk 		 		 			for operating leases with minimum scheduled rent increases the company recognizes income on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured recognizing rental income on a straightline basis results in a difference in the timing of revenue amounts from what is contractually due from tenants if the company determines that collectibility of straightline rents is not reasonably assured future revenue recognition is limited to amounts contractually owed and paid and when appropriate an allowance for estimated losses is established 		 		 			resident fee revenue is recorded when services are rendered and includes resident room and care charges community fees and other resident charges residency agreements are generally for a term of 30 days to one year with resident fees billed monthly revenue for certain care related services is recognized as services are provided and is billed monthly in arrears 		 		 			loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity loans heldforinvestment are carried at

recoveries and income from dfls 		 			 				 2 			 		 			 			noi and adjusted noi are nongaap supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate the company defines noi as rental and related revenues including tenant recoveries resident fees and services and income from dfls less property level operating expense noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income as presented below the company believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline rents dfl accretion amortization of market lease intangibles and lease termination fees adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as cash noi the company uses noi  		 		  		 			95 		   		 			table of contents 		  		and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property level performance the company believes that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by gaap because it does not reflect various excluded items further the companys definition of noi may not be comparable to the definition used by other reits or real estate companies as those companies may use different methodologies for calculating noi 		 			  		 		 			the following is a reconciliation from reported net income to noi and
