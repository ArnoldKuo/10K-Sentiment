		 			3 		   		 			table of contents 		  		  		 		 			business strategy  		 		 			we invest and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize the benefit to our shareholders and support the growth of our dividends the core elements of our strategy are i to acquire develop lease own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across multiple business segments and geographic locations including europe ii to align ourselves with leading healthcare companies operators and service providers which over the longterm should result in higher relative rental rates net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values iii to concentrate on longerterm escalating triplenet leases with highquality tenants while using ridea structures for properties that have higher growth potential iv to maintain adequate liquidity with longterm fixed rate debt financing with staggered maturities which supports the longerterm nature of our investments while reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk at any point in the interest rate or credit cycles and v to continue to manage our balance sheet with a targeted financial leverage of 40 relative to our assets 		 		 			internal growth strategies 		 		 			we believe that our longerterm escalating triplenet leases with financially strong tenants and operators enhance the quality stability and growth of our rental income further we believe many of our existing properties hold the potential for increased future cash flows as they are of high quality and in desirable locations within markets where the creation of new supply is limited by the lack of available sites and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary licensing other approvals andor financing our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties  		 		 			we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			build and maintain longterm leasing and management relationships with quality tenants and operators in choosing locations for our properties we focus our attention on their physical environment adjacency to established businesses eg hospital systems and educational centers proximity to sources of business growth and other local demographic factors 		 			 				  			 		 			 			replace tenants and operators quickly at the best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs we believe that we are wellpositioned to attract new tenants and operators and achieve attractive rental rates and operating cash flow as a result of the location design and maintenance of our properties together with our reputation for highquality building services and responsiveness to tenants and our ability to offer space alternatives within our portfolios 		 			 				  			 		 			 			extend and modify terms of existing leases prior to expiration we structure lease extensions early renewals or modifications which reduce the cost associated with lease downtime or the reinvestment risk resulting from the exercise of tenants purchase options while securing the tenancy andor relationship of our high quality tenants and operators on a longterm basis 		 			investment strategies 		 		 			the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector 		 		 			while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies 		 		 			we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment vehicle or geographic location the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator or loans that may be made to a single borrower in allocating capital to our multiple segments we target  		 		  		 			4 		   		 			table of contents 		  		opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for our portfolio as a whole we may take additional measures to mitigate risk including diversifying our investments by sector geography tenant or operator structuring transactions as master leases requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications and obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits 		 		 			we believe we are well positioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions financing and development other factors that contribute to our competitive position include  		 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our reputation gained through nearly 30 years of successful operations and the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with leading healthcare operators private equity firms corporations nonprofits and public institutions seeking to monetize existing assets or develop new facilities 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of highquality healthcare real estate assets 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing due to the strength of our experienced management team and balance sheet liquidity 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions responsively and efficiently which provides confidence to domestic and foreign institutions and private investors who seek to sell healthcare real estate in our market areas 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the healthcare and real estate industries and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our control of sites including assets under contract with radius restrictions 		 			financing strategies 		 		 			because our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt  		 		 			we may finance acquisitions and other investments through the following vehicles 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			issuance of common or preferred stock  		 			 				  			 		 			 			issuance or origination of debt including unsecured notes and mortgage debt  		 			 				  			 		 			 			borrowings under our credit facility or 		 			 				  			 		 			 			sale of ownership interests in properties or other investments  		 			we maintain a disciplined balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit facility access to capital markets and secured debt lenders relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners and our ability to divest of assets our debt obligations are primarily longterm fixed rate with staggered maturities which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations 		 		 			we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing by offering equity and debt securities placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			5 		   		 			table of contents 		  		  		 		 			competition 		 		 			investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies pension funds private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater flexibility eg nonreit competitors resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by global national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 		 		 			income from our investments is dependent on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other companies on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation success of product or drug development the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and the financial condition of our tenants and operators private federal and state payment programs and government reimbursement as well as the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see item 1a risk factors in this report 		 		 			healthcare segments  		 		 			senior housing at december 31 2014

flood windstorm earthquake environmental and terrorism related losses we attempt to obtain appropriate policy terms conditions limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss the cost of such coverage and current industry practice there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable in addition we have a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake flood and windstorm occurrences for which the related insurances carry higher deductibles 		 		 			we maintain

			employees of hcp 		 		 			at december 31 2014 we had 170 fulltime employees none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 		 		 			government regulation licensing and enforcement 		 		 			overview 		 		 			our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care licensure and certificate of need government reimbursement fraud and abuse practices and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws regulations reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under item 1a risk factors in this report 		 		 			based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators excluding our medical office segment at december 31 2014 we estimate that approximately 15 and 14 of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement respectively 		 		 			the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 		 		 			fraud and abuse enforcement 		 		 			there are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs ii federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the stark law which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v federal and state privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 commonly referred to as hipaa which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions many of our tenants and operators are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws 		 		 		 		  		 			10 		   		 			table of contents 		  		reimbursement  		 		 			sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare programs and state medicaid programs and nongovernmental thirdparty payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government and many states face significant current and future budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations aco and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants and operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations 		 		 			healthcare licensure and certificate of need 		 		 			certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants and operators abilities to expand or change their businesses 		 		 			life science facilities 		 		 			while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 		 		 			senior housing entrance fee communities 		 		 			certain of our senior housing facilities are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facilitys financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 		 		 			americans with disabilities act the ada 		 		 			our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 		 		 			environmental matters 		 		 			a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore  		 		  		 			11 		   		 			table of contents 		  		could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our earnings for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see item 1a

adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			as set forth below we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following categories 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to our business and operations 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to our capital structure and market conditions  		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to other events and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to tax including reitrelated risks 		 			  		 		 			risks related to our business 		 		 			we depend on a limited number of operators and tenants that account for a large percentage of our revenues 		 		 			during the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 40 of our revenues were generated by our leasing or financial arrangements with the following two companies hcrmc 26 and brookdale 14 the inability or other failure of these tenants or operators to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay cause our stock price to decline and have other materially adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			in addition any failure by these tenants or operators to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition these tenants and operators generally have also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and we cannot provide any assurance that they will have sufficient assets income access to financing andor insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their indemnification obligations 		 		 		 		  		 			12 		   		 			table of contents 		  		our ownership interest in and lease with our largest tenant hcrmc accounts for a significant portion of our assets and revenues adverse regulatory or operational developments in hcrmcs business or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us 		 		 			hcrmc is a provider of a range of healthcare services primarily in postacute care skilled nursing care and assisted living and our largest tenant representing 31 and 26 of our gross assets and revenues respectively as of and for the year ended december 31 2014 we also own a 94 equity interest in hcrmc which we acquired together with our april 2011 6 billion acquisition of substantially all the real estate assets of hcrmc in december 2014 we recorded an impairment charge of 36 million for our equity ownership interest in hcrmc primarily resulting from our review of their 2015 preliminary base financial forecast and other financial information provided by hcrmc that reflected a continued shift in patient payor sources from medicare to medicare advantage which negatively impacts reimbursement rates and length of stay for hcrmcs skilled nursing segment 		 		 			additionally hcrmc has responded to a civil investigative demand subpoenas and other requests for information regarding their skilled nursing facilities in connection with an inquiry coordinated by the us department of justice the department of health and human services office of inspector general and certain state attorneys general offices hcrmc believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations however since the review is ongoing the ultimate outcome is uncertain and could among other things 1 require substantial time and costs to continue to respond to and defend hcrmcs actions 2 require hcrmc to refund or adjust amounts previously paid for services under governmental programs 3 require payment of substantial fines penalties or other sanctions 4 result in the loss of hcrmcs right to participate in the medicare or medicaid programs or 5 cause damage to hcrmcs reputation 		 		 			continued deterioration in hcrmcs operating performance or other adverse developments in its business operating and regulatory affairs or financial condition could reduce the revenues we earn under our master lease with hcrmc andor impair the value of our master lease with hcrmc either of which could have a material adverse effect on us  		 		 			see additional information regarding the aforementioned impairment charge 94 equity interest in hcrmc and master lease with hcrmc in i item 7 results of operations postacuteskilled nursing segment 20142013 comparison and ii note 6 dfls note 8 unconsolidated joint ventures and note 17 impairments to the consolidated financial statements 		 		 			the properties managed by brookdale account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income adverse developments in brookdales business and affairs or financial condition could have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			as of january 1 2015 brookdale managed 69 senior housing facilities that we own and 14 ccrcs owned by our unconsolidated joint venture pursuant to longterm management agreements these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio based on their gross book value and account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements we rely on brookdales personnel expertise technical resources and information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively we also rely on brookdale to set appropriate resident fees to provide accurate propertylevel financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our senior housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations 		 		 			in its capacity as a manager brookdale does not lease our properties and therefore we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as a triplenet tenant however any adverse developments in brookdales business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a materially adverse effect on us brookdale is also one of our triplenet tenants if brookdale experiences any significant financial legal accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise such difficulties could result in among other adverse events acceleration of its indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 		 		  		 			13 		   		 			table of contents 		  		the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major tenants or operators may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to third party tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or operator or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be recharacterized as a financing agreement in which case our rights and remedies as a lender compared to a landlord generally would be more limited 		 		 			also if a debtormanager seeks bankruptcy protection the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case in any of these events we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant operator or manager furthermore many of our facilities are leased to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may involve specific procedural requirements and may not be successful 		 		 			additionally the financial weakness or other inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in cross default under our other indebtedness although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of an applicable tenant or operator may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other materially adverse consequences 		 		 			increased competition has resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our tenants and operators and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 		 		 			the healthcare industry is highly competitive the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area  		 		 			our tenants and operators also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers such competition which is due in part to historical over development in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that the tenants and operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants and operators thus our tenants and operators may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets andor increasing our collection and dispute costs 		 		 		 		  		 			14 		   		 			table of contents 		  		competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or to retain or attract tenants and operators 		 		 			we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities similarly our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators or may reduce the rents we are able to charge if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms or attract and retain profitable tenants and operators our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 		 		 			economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			for the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 35 of our revenue was derived from properties located in california 23 and texas 12 as a result we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions increased competition or decreased demand changes in statespecific legislation and local climate events and natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires and hurricanes which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 		 		 			we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other tenants and operators 		 		 			healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific a new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property depending on that tenants or operators particular business if a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent andor vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators these expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			we face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken 		 		 			largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred 		 			 				  			 		 			 			the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and higher materials transportation labor leasing or other costs which could make the completion of the development project less profitable 		 			 				  			 		 			 			construction andor permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 		 			 				  			 		 			 			the project may not be completed on schedule as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters labor conditions material shortages regulatory hurdles civil unrest and acts of war which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses or provide tenants or operators with the right to terminate preconstruction leases and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable 		 		 		  		 			15 		   		 			table of contents 		  		our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments 		 		 			we have and may continue in the future to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decisionmaking authority which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes including litigation or arbitration 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives including the timing terms and strategies for any investments 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest and risk to our reit status 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners might become bankrupt fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues 		 			from time to time we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 		 		 			acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities including 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			liabilities relating to the cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions 		 			 				  			 		 			 			unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller

addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			from time to time we have made and in the future we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds 		 		 			we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder

tenants and operators for example many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with selfinsurance trusts or captive programs that may provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities may underestimate the future cost of claims and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry however we cannot provide any assurances that we will continue to require the same level of insurance coverage of our tenants and operators or that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future also we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses or losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 		 		 			our tenants and operators face litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs 		 		 			in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the

resulted in large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants and operators for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a
