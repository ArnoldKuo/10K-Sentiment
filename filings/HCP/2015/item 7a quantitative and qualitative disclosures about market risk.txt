 		 		 			we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements 		 		 			to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 4 million see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis details 		 		 			interest rate risk 		 		 			at december 31 2014 we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates primarily on variable rate investments which have been predominately hedged through interest rate swap contracts 		 		 			interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate investments and variablerate debt and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2014 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 9 million or 002 per common share on a diluted basis 		 		 			  		 		 			foreign currency exchange rate risk 		 		 			at december 31 2014 our exposure to foreign currencies primarily relates to uk investments in leased real estate loan investments senior unsecured notes and the related gbp denominated cash flows from such investments our foreign currency exposure is partially mitigated through the use of gbp denominated borrowings and foreign currency swap contracts 		 		 			  		 		 			market risk 		 		 			we have investments in marketable debt securities classified as heldtomaturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our  		 		  		 			62 		   		 			table of contents 		  		current adjusted carrying value the issuers financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the market value if any at december 31 2014 the fair value and carrying value of marketable debt securities were 252 million and 231 million respectively 		 		 			the principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below the fair value for our senior unsecured notes payable is based on prevailing market prices the fair value estimates for loans receivable and mortgage debt payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity 		 		 			the table below summarizes the carrying amounts and fair values
