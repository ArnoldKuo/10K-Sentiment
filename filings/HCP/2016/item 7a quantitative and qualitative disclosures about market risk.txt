 		 		 			we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates specifically the gbp we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements 		 		 			 		  		 			64 		   		 			table of contents 		 to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 6 million see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis details 		 		 			interest rate risk 		 		 			at december 31 2015 we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates primarily on variable rate debt which has been predominately hedged through interest rate swap contracts 		 		 			interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing if interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt whether at maturity or otherwise our future earnings and cash flows could adversely be affected by additional borrowing costs conversely lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate debt and variablerate investments and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2015 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 3 million or less than 001 per common share on a diluted basis 		 		 			  		 		 			foreign currency exchange rate risk 		 		 			at december 31 2015 our exposure to foreign currencies primarily relates to uk investments in leased real estate senior notes and related gbp denominated cash flows our foreign currency exposure is partially mitigated through the use of gbp denominated borrowings and foreign currency swap contracts based solely on our operating results for the three months ended december 31 2015 including the impact of existing hedging arrangements if the value of the gbp relative to the us dollar were to increase or decrease by 10 compared to the average exchange rate during the quarter ended december 31 2015 our cash flows would have decreased or increased as applicable by less than 1 million 		 		 			market risk 		 		 			we have investments in marketable debt securities classified as heldtomaturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current adjusted carrying value the issuers financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the market value if any at december 31 2015 both the fair value and carrying value of marketable debt securities were 103 million 		 		 			 		  		 			65 		   		 			table of contents 		 the principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below the fair value for our senior unsecured notes payable is based on prevailing market prices the fair value estimates for loans receivable and mortgage debt payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity 		 		 			the table below summarizes
