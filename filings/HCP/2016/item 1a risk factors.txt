strategy  		 		 			we invest and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize the benefit to our stockholders and support the growth of our dividends the core elements of our strategy are i to acquire develop lease own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across multiple business segments and geographic locations including europe ii to align ourselves with leading healthcare companies operators and service providers which over the longterm should result in higher relative rental rates net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values iii to allocate capital targeting a balanced portfolio between longerterm escalating triplenet leases with highquality tenants and operating businesses with shorterterm leases in our medical office and life science segments iv to maintain adequate liquidity with longterm fixed rate debt financing with staggered maturities which supports the longerterm nature of our investments while reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk at any point in the interest rate or credit cycles and v to continue to manage our balance sheet with a targeted financial leverage of 40 relative to our assets 		 		 			internal growth strategies 		 		 			we believe that our longerterm escalating triplenet leases with larger tenants and operators having scale enhance the quality stability and growth of our rental income further we believe many of our existing properties hold the potential for increased future cash flows as they are well maintained and in desirable locations within markets where the creation of new supply is limited by the lack of available sites and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary licensing other approvals andor financing our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties  		 		 			we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			build and maintain longterm leasing and management relationships with quality tenants and operators in choosing locations for our properties we focus our attention on their physical environment adjacency to established businesses eg hospital systems and educational centers proximity to sources of business growth and other local demographic factors 		 			 				  			 		 			 			replace tenants and operators at the best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs we believe that we are wellpositioned to attract new tenants and operators and achieve attractive rental rates and operating cash flow as a result of the location design and maintenance of our properties together with our reputation for highquality building services and responsiveness to tenants and our ability to offer space alternatives within our portfolios 		 			 				  			 		 			 			extend and modify terms of existing leases prior to expiration we structure lease extensions early renewals or modifications which reduce the cost associated with lease downtime or the reinvestment risk resulting from the exercise of tenants purchase options while securing the tenancy and relationship of our high quality tenants and operators on a longterm basis 		 			investment strategies 		 		 			the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling longterm demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector 		 		 			while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies 		 		 			we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment vehicle or geographic location the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator or loans that may be made to a single borrower in allocating capital to our multiple segments we target opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for our portfolio as a whole we may take additional measures to  		  		 			4 		   		 			table of contents 		 mitigate risk including diversifying our investments by sector geography tenant or operator structuring transactions as master leases requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications and obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits 		 		 			we believe we are wellpositioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions financing and development other factors that contribute to our competitive position include  		 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our reputation gained through over 30 years of successful operations and the strength of our existing portfolio of properties 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with leading healthcare operators and systems investment banks and other market intermediaries corporations private equity firms nonprofits and public institutions seeking to monetize existing assets or develop new facilities 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of highquality healthcare real estate 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing due to the strength of our experienced management team and balance sheet liquidity 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions responsively and efficiently which provides confidence to domestic and foreign institutions and private investors who seek to sell healthcare real estate in our market areas 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the healthcare and real estate industries  		 			 				  			 		 			 			our control of sites including assets under contract with radius restrictions and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			in addition we regularly conduct portfolio reviews that help identify assets ranked in the bottom tiers we look for opportunities to monetize such noncore assets to improve the overall quality of our portfolio 		 			financing strategies 		 		 			our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains therefore we dont retain capital as a result we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt  		 		 			we may finance acquisitions and other investments through the following vehicles 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			borrowings under our credit facility  		 			 				  			 		 			 			issuance or origination of debt including unsecured notes term loans and mortgage debt  		 			 				  			 		 			 			sale of ownership interests in properties or other investments or  		 			 				  			 		 			 			issuance of common or preferred stock or equivalent 		 			we maintain a disciplined balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit facility access to capital markets and secured debt lenders relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners and our ability to divest of assets our debt obligations are primarily longterm fixed rate with staggered maturities which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations 		 		 			we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing by offering debt and equity securities placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders and

we face competition from other reits investment companies pension funds private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater flexibility eg nonreit competitors resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by global national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 		 		 			income from our investments is dependent on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other companies on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation success of product or drug development the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and the financial condition of our tenants and operators private federal and state payment programs and government reimbursement as well as the

life science and ridea facilities tenants under triplenet leases primarily in our senior housing postacuteskilled nursing and hospital segments are required to provide primary property business interruption and liability insurance we maintain separate general and professional liability insurance for our ridea facilities additionally our corporate general and professional liability insurance program also extends coverage for all of our properties beyond the aforementioned on an annual basis we review whether we or brookdale will bear responsibility for maintaining the required insurance

enforcement 		 		 			overview 		 		 			our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care licensure and certificate of need government reimbursement fraud and abuse practices and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws regulations reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under item 1a risk factors in this report 		 		 			based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators excluding our medical office segment at december 31 2015 we estimate that approximately 13 and 12 of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement respectively 		 		 			the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 		 		 			fraud and abuse enforcement 		 		 			there are various extremely complex us federal and state laws and regulations and in relation to our facilities located in the uk national laws and regulations of england scotland northern ireland and wales governing healthcare providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i us federal state false claims acts and uk antifraud legislation and regulation which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other us federal or state or uk healthcare programs ii us federal state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit or restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services and uk legislation and regulations on financial inducements and vested interests iii us federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the stark law which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v us federal state and uk privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 commonly referred to as hipaa and the uk data protection act 1988 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of us and uk healthcare fraud and abuse laws  		  		 			10 		   		 			table of contents 		 carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and in the us can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions many of our tenants and operators are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws 		 		 			reimbursement  		 		 			sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare programs and state medicaid programs and in the uk the national health service nhs and local authority funding and nongovernmental thirdparty payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government many states face significant current and future budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators similarly in the uk the nhs and the local authorities are undertaking efforts to reduce costs which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by our uk tenants and operators additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the us including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations aco and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants and operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations  		 		 			healthcare licensure and certificate of need 		 		 			certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio including our facilities located in the uk are subject to extensive national federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to handle controlled substances including narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states in the us require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants and operators abilities to expand or change their businesses 		 		 			life science facilities 		 		 			while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 		 		 			senior housing entrance fee communities 		 		 			certain of our senior housing facilities are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facilitys financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 		 		 			americans with disabilities act the ada 		 		 			our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make  		  		 			11 		   		 			table of contents 		 modifications as appropriate in this respect 		 		 			environmental matters 		 		 			a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the value of such property and the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our earnings for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see item 1a risk factors in this

our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			as set forth below we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to our business and operations 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to our capital structure and market conditions  		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to other events and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			risks related to tax including reitrelated risks 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			risks related to our business and operations 		 		 			we depend on a limited number of tenants and operators for a large percentage of our revenues and net operating income 		 		 			we manage our facilities utilizing lease and ridea structures under our lease arrangements we generated 33 of our revenues from hcrmc 23 and brookdale 10 during the year ended december 31 2015 hcrmc is an operator that primarily provides postacute care skilled nursing care and assisted living services and relies heavily on government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 		 		 			in addition to our lease arrangement with brookdale under ridea structures we generated 8 of our net operating  		  		 			12 		   		 			table of contents 		 income from properties managed by brookdale during the year ended december 31 2015 services provided by our tenants or operators in facilities managed under a ridea structure are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs we report the resident level fees and services revenues and corresponding operating expenses in our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			the inability or other failure of either hcrmc under its lease agreements or brookdale under its lease agreements and ridea structures to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow net operating income and results of operations which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay to our stockholders cause our stock price to decline and have other materially adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			in addition any failure by hcrmc or brookdale to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition furthermore they each face an increasingly competitive labor market for skilled management personnel and nurses which can cause operating costs to increase while hcrmc and brookdale generally have also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses they may have insufficient assets income access to financing andor insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their indemnification obligations 		 		 			the real estate portfolio that we have master leased to hcrmc accounts for a significant portion of our assets and revenues adverse regulatory and operational developments in hcrmcs business and financial condition have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on us 		 		 			hcrmc a provider of a range of healthcare services primarily in postacute care skilled nursing care and assisted living is our largest tenant representing 23 of our gross assets and revenues as of and for the year ended december 31 2015 in april 2011 we completed a 6 billion acquisition of substantially all the real estate assets of and an equity interest in hcrmc in the first quarter 2015 we recorded an impairment charge of 478 million related to the real estate portfolio master leased to hcrmc based on the present value of the future lease payments under the amendment to the master lease with hcrmc that became effective april 1 2015 as a result of hcrmcs fourth quarter 2015 performance deterioration and related decline in fixed charge coverage we subsequently placed the real estate portfolio master leased to hcrmc on watch list status effective at yearend 2015 and changed our accounting treatment to recognize rental income on a cash basis beginning january 1 2016 furthermore hcrmcs preliminary 2016 forecast indicates only limited improvement in its fixed charge coverage and free cash flow after capital expenditures in 2016 accordingly we assessed the value of this real estate portfolio including obtaining an independent valuation appraisal of our postacuteskilled nursing and senior housing facilities as a result we reduced the carrying value of this real estate portfolio to 52 billion approximating its estimated market value which resulted in an impairment charge of 817 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015  		 		 			in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2015 we recorded impairment charges of 36 million and 27 million respectively for our equity ownership interest in hcrmc these impairment charges resulted primarily from our review of their 2015 preliminary base financial forecast operating results and other financial information provided by hcrmc as well as market and industry data that among other factors showed a declining trend in admissions from hospitals and continuing trends in mix and length of stay driven by medicare advantage and other managed care plans as a result of hcrmcs fourth quarter 2015 performance deterioration we recorded an additional impairment charge of 19 million for our equity ownership in hcrmc reducing its carrying value to zero 		 		 			on april 20 2015 the doj unsealed a previously filed complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia against hcrmc and certain of its affiliates in three consolidated cases following a civil investigation arising out of three lawsuits filed by former employees of hcrmc under the qui tam provisions of the federal false claims act the complaint alleges that hcrmc submitted claims to medicare for therapy services that were not covered by the skilled nursing facility benefit were not medically reasonable and necessary and were not skilled in nature and therefore not entitled to medicare reimbursement hcrmc incurred legal and regulatory defense costs of 3 million and 9 million during the fourth quarter and full year 2015 respectively while the doj litigation is at an early stage and hcrmc has indicated that it believes the claims are unjust and it will vigorously defend against them the ultimate outcome is uncertain and could among other things cause hcrmc to i incur substantial additional time and costs to respond to and defend

under its amended master lease with us 		 		 			continued deterioration in hcrmcs operating performance business or financial condition or adverse regulatory developments could further reduce the revenues we earn under our master lease with hcrmc further impair the value of our master lease with hcrmc and result in among other adverse events acceleration of hcrmcs indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code any one or a

brookdale account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income adverse developments in brookdales business and affairs or financial condition could have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			as of december 31 2015 brookdale managed 108 senior housing facilities that we own and 15 ccrcs owned by our unconsolidated joint venture pursuant to longterm management agreements for the year ended december 31 2015 these properties represented 12 and 10 of our gross assets and revenues respectively although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements we rely on brookdales personnel expertise technical resources and information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively we also rely on brookdale to set appropriate resident fees to provide accurate propertylevel financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our senior housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations  		 		 			in its capacity as a manager brookdale does not lease our properties and therefore we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as a triplenet tenant however any adverse developments in brookdales business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a materially adverse effect on us brookdale is also one of our triplenet tenants if brookdale experiences any significant financial legal accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise such difficulties could result in among other adverse events acceleration of its indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major tenants operators or borrowers may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to third party tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties we are also a direct or indirect lender to various tenants and operators although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or operator or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the  		  		 			14 		   		 			table of contents 		 least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be recharacterized as a financing agreement in which case our rights and remedies as a lender compared to a landlord generally would be more limited 		 		 			also if a debtormanager seeks bankruptcy protection the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case in any of these events we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes insurance debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant operator or manager furthermore many of our facilities are leased to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may involve specific procedural requirements and may not be successful 		 		 			additionally the financial weakness or other inability of our tenants operators or borrowers to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in cross default under our other indebtedness although we may be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of an applicable tenant or operator may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other materially adverse consequences 		 		 			increased competition has resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our tenants operators and borrowers and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 		 		 			the healthcare industry is highly competitive the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area in addition our tenants operators and borrowers face an increasingly competitive labor market for skilled management personnel and nurses an inability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and nurses and other trained personnel could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures on wages may force tenants operators and borrowers to enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for skilled personnel or to use more expensive contract personnel but they be unable to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses or any failure by our tenants operators or borrowers to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our cash flow and have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			our tenants operators and borrowers also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers this competition which is due in part to over development in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that our tenants operators and borrowers will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels and to manage their expenses in a way that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants operators and borrowers they may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses or to manage their expenses either of which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets andor increasing our collection and dispute costs  		 		 			 		  		 			15 		   		 			table of contents 		 competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or to retain or attract tenants and operators 		 		 			we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities similarly our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators or may reduce the rents we are able to charge if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices

have increased in some cases it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 		 		 			  		 		 			risk related to tax including reitrelated risks 		 		 			loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have materially adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock 		 		 			qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 		 		 			if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we will be subject to corporatelevel income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we could be subject to increased state and local income taxes and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a reit 		 			as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 		 		 			the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with reits constantly are under review by persons involved in the legislative process the us internal revenue service the irs and the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments and affect the tax considerations of an investment in us 		 		 			we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 		 		 			if during the fiveyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize a gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition  		  		 			25 		   		 			table of contents 		 date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 		 		 			in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any 		 		 			there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits eampp in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute eampp 		 		 			in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit eampp of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such eampp distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such eampp distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such eampp distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of eampp including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit eampp moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit eampp which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 		 		 			thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit eampp by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our eampp we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so 		 		 			the lease of qualified healthcare properties to a taxable reit subsidiary or trs is subject to special requirements 		 		 			we may lease certain qualified healthcare properties to a trs which in turn contracts with a manager or related party to operate the property the rents from this trs lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if i they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified healthcare property with the trs and ii the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor as defined in the code if either of these conditions is not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents 		 		 			recent tax legislation impacts certain us federal income tax rules applicable to reits and could adversely affect our current tax positions 		 		 			the recently enacted protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 the act contains changes to certain aspects of the us federal income tax rules applicable to us the act is the most recent example of changes to the reit rules and additional legislative changes may occur that could adversely affect our current tax positions the act modifies various rules that apply to our ownership of and business relationship with our trss and reduces the maximum allowable value of our assets attributable to trss from 25 to 20 which could impact our ability to enter into future investments the act makes permanent the reduction of the recognition period from ten years to five years during which an entity that converted from a corporation to a reit or was acquired by a reit is subject to a corporatelevel tax on builtin gains recognized during such period which could influence the types of investments we enter into in the future the act also makes multiple changes related to the foreign investment in real property tax act or firpta expands prohibited transaction safe harbors and qualifying hedges and repeals the preferential dividend rule for public reits previously applicable to us lastly the act adjusts the way we may calculate certain earnings and profits calculations to avoid double taxation at the stockholder level and expands the types of qualifying assets and income for purposes of the reit requirements the provisions enacted by the act could result in changes in our tax positions or investments and future legislative changes related to those rules described above could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our
