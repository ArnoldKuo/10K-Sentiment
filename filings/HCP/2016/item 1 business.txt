to the consolidated financial statements 		 			unconsolidated joint ventures at december 31 2015 we had interests in unconsolidated joint ventures representing 27 properties with an aggregate

		 			business strategy  		 		 			we invest and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize the benefit to our stockholders and support the growth of our dividends the core elements of our strategy are i to acquire develop lease own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across multiple business segments and geographic locations including europe ii to align ourselves with leading healthcare companies operators and service providers which over the longterm should result in higher relative rental rates net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values iii to allocate capital targeting a balanced portfolio between longerterm escalating triplenet leases with highquality tenants and operating businesses with shorterterm leases in our medical office and life science segments iv to maintain adequate liquidity with longterm fixed rate debt financing with staggered maturities which supports the longerterm nature of our investments while reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk at any point in the interest rate or credit cycles and v to continue to manage our balance sheet with a targeted financial leverage of 40 relative to our assets 		 		 			internal growth strategies 		 		 			we believe that our longerterm escalating triplenet leases with larger tenants and operators having scale enhance the quality stability and growth of our rental income further we believe many of our existing properties hold the potential for increased future cash flows as they are well maintained and in desirable locations within markets where the creation of new supply is limited by the lack of available sites and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary licensing other approvals andor financing our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties  		 		 			we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			build and maintain longterm leasing and management relationships with quality tenants and operators in choosing locations for our properties we focus our attention on their physical environment adjacency to established businesses eg hospital systems and educational centers proximity to sources of business growth and other local demographic factors 		 			 				  			 		 			 			replace tenants and operators at the best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs we believe that we are wellpositioned to attract new tenants and operators and achieve attractive rental rates and operating cash flow as a result of the location design and maintenance of our properties together with our reputation for highquality building services and responsiveness to tenants and our ability to offer space alternatives within our portfolios 		 			 				  			 		 			 			extend and modify terms of existing leases prior to expiration we structure lease extensions early renewals or modifications which reduce the cost associated with lease downtime or the reinvestment risk resulting from the exercise of tenants purchase options while securing the tenancy and relationship of our high quality tenants and operators on a longterm basis 		 			investment strategies 		 		 			the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling longterm demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector 		 		 			while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies 		 		 			we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment vehicle or geographic location the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator or loans that may be made to a single borrower in allocating capital to our multiple segments we target opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for our portfolio as a whole we may take additional measures to  		  		 			4 		   		 			table of contents 		 mitigate risk including diversifying our investments by sector geography tenant or operator structuring transactions as master leases requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications and obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits 		 		 			we believe we are wellpositioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions financing and development other factors that contribute to our competitive position include  		 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our reputation gained through over 30 years of successful operations and the strength of our existing portfolio of properties 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with leading healthcare operators and systems investment banks and other market intermediaries corporations private equity firms nonprofits and public institutions seeking to monetize existing assets or develop new facilities 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of highquality healthcare real estate 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing due to the strength of our experienced management team and balance sheet liquidity 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions responsively and efficiently which provides confidence to domestic and foreign institutions and private investors who seek to sell healthcare real estate in our market areas 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the healthcare and real estate industries  		 			 				  			 		 			 			our control of sites including assets under contract with radius restrictions and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			in addition we regularly conduct portfolio reviews that help identify assets ranked in the bottom tiers we look for opportunities to monetize such noncore assets to improve the overall quality of our portfolio 		 			financing strategies 		 		 			our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains therefore we dont retain capital as a result we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt  		 		 			we may finance acquisitions and other investments through the following vehicles 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			borrowings under our credit facility  		 			 				  			 		 			 			issuance or origination of debt including unsecured notes term loans and mortgage debt  		 			 				  			 		 			 			sale of ownership interests in properties or other investments or  		 			 				  			 		 			 			issuance of common or preferred stock or equivalent 		 			we maintain a disciplined balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit facility access to capital markets and secured debt lenders relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners and our ability to divest of assets our debt obligations are primarily longterm fixed rate with staggered maturities which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations 		 		 			we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing by offering debt and equity securities placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders and joint venture partners 		 		 			  		 		 			 		  		 			5 		   		 			table of contents 		   		 		 			competition 		 		 			investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies pension funds private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater flexibility eg nonreit competitors resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by global national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 		 		 			income from our investments is dependent on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other companies on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation success of product or drug development the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and the financial condition of our tenants and operators private federal and state payment programs and government reimbursement as well as the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see
