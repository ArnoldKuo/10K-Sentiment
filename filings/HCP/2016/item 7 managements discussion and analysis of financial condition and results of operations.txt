2015 transaction overview and ii note 6 net investment in direct financing leases note 8 investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures note 17 impairments and note 23 concentration of credit risk to the consolidated financial statements 		 		 			the properties managed by brookdale account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income adverse developments in brookdales business and affairs or financial condition could have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			as of december 31 2015 brookdale managed 108 senior housing facilities that we own and 15 ccrcs owned by our unconsolidated joint venture pursuant to longterm management agreements for the year ended december 31 2015 these properties represented 12 and 10 of our gross assets and revenues respectively although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements we rely on brookdales personnel expertise technical resources and information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively we also rely on brookdale to set appropriate resident fees to provide accurate propertylevel financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our senior housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations  		 		 			in its capacity as a manager brookdale does not lease our properties and therefore we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as a triplenet tenant however any adverse developments in brookdales business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a materially adverse effect on us brookdale is also one of our triplenet tenants if brookdale experiences any significant financial legal accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise such difficulties could result in among other adverse events acceleration of its indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major tenants operators or borrowers may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to third party tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties we are also a direct or indirect lender to various tenants and operators although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or operator or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the  		  		 			14 		   		 			table of contents 		 least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be recharacterized as a financing agreement in which case our rights and remedies as a lender compared to a landlord generally would be more limited 		 		 			also if a debtormanager seeks bankruptcy protection the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case in any of these events we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes insurance debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant operator or manager furthermore many of our facilities are leased to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may involve specific procedural requirements and may not be successful 		 		 			additionally the financial weakness or other inability of our tenants operators or borrowers to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in cross default under our other indebtedness although we may be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of an applicable tenant or operator may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other materially adverse consequences 		 		 			increased competition has resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our tenants operators and borrowers and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 		 		 			the healthcare industry is highly competitive the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area in addition our tenants operators and borrowers face an increasingly competitive labor market for skilled management personnel and nurses an inability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and nurses and other trained personnel could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures on wages may force tenants operators and borrowers to enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for skilled personnel or to use more expensive contract personnel but they be unable to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses or any failure by our tenants operators or borrowers to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our cash flow and have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			our tenants operators and borrowers also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers this competition which is due in part to over development in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that our tenants operators and borrowers will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels and to manage their expenses in a way that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants operators and borrowers they may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses or to manage their expenses either of which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets andor increasing our collection and dispute costs  		 		 			 		  		 			15 		   		 			table of contents 		 competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or to retain or attract tenants and operators 		 		 			we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities similarly our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators or may reduce the rents we are able to charge if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms or attract and retain profitable tenants and operators our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 		 		 			economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			for the year ended december 31 2015 35 of our revenue was derived from properties located in california 22 and texas 13 as a result we may be subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions increased competition or decreased demand changes in statespecific legislation and local climate events and natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires and hurricanes which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 		 		 			we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other tenants and operators 		 		 			healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific a new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property depending on that tenants or operators particular business if a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent andor vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators these expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			we face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken 		 		 			property development is a component of our growth strategy at december 31 2015 our actual investment and estimated commitments under our development platform including land held for redevelopment represented approximately 721 million or 3 of our total assets largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred 		 			 				  			 		 			 			the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and higher materials transportation labor leasing or other costs which could make the completion of the development project less profitable 		 			 				  			 		 			 			construction andor permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 		 			 				  			 		 			 			the project may not be completed on schedule as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters labor conditions material shortages regulatory hurdles civil unrest and acts of war which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses or provide tenants or operators with the right to terminate preconstruction leases and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to  		  		 			16 		   		 			table of contents 		 make the property profitable  		 			any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments 		 		 			we have and may continue in the future to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decisionmaking authority which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes including litigation or arbitration 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives including the timing terms and strategies for any investments 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest and risk to our reit status 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners might become bankrupt fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues 		 			any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			from time to time we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 		 		 			acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities including 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			liabilities relating to the cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions 		 			 				  			 		 			 			unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller

indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the seller and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition 		 			in addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			 		  		 			17 		   		 			table of contents 		 from time to time we have made and in the future we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds 		 		 			we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value future acquisitions may require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures each of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 		 		 			our tenants operators and borrowers face litigation and may continue to experience rising liability and insurance costs 		 		 			in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the tenants and operators of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients has resulted in large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants operators and borrowers for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our tenants and operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance or cause our borrowers to be unable to meet their obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits arising from the alleged actions of our tenants or operators for which claims such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify us but which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part 		 		 			the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants operators and borrowers ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 		 		 			certain of our tenants operators and borrowers are affected directly or indirectly by an extremely complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations pertaining to governmental reimbursement programs such laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes that are sometimes applied retroactively see item 1businessgovernment regulation licensing and enforcement above for example to the extent that any of our tenants or operators receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			statutory and regulatory changes 		 			 				  			 		 			 			retroactive rate adjustments 		 			 				  			 		 			 			recovery of program overpayments or

			interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such properties 		 			if our tenants operators or borrowers directly or indirectly fail to comply with the extensive laws regulations and other requirements applicable to their business and the operation of our properties they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental reimbursement programs face bans on admissions of new patients or residents suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations these laws and regulations are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions for  		  		 			18 		   		 			table of contents 		 example one of our borrowers tandem health care has an operator of its facilities consulate health care consulate facing a qui tam or whistleblower action alleging that consulate overbilled the federal government and the state of florida our tenants operators and borrowers could be adversely affected by the resources required to respond to an investigation or other enforcement action in such event the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants and the results of operations of our properties operated by those entities could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us we are unable to predict future federal state and local regulations and legislation including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to budgetary pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our tenants operators and borrowers costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our tenants operators or borrowers to comply with these laws and regulations and significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 		 		 			legislation to address federal government operations and administration decisions affecting the centers for medicare and medicaid services could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants operators and borrowers liquidity financial condition or results of operations 		 		 			congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to the federal debt ceiling the affordable care act as defined below tax reform and entitlement programs including reimbursement rates for physicians could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants operators and borrowers liquidity financial condition or results of operations in particular changes in funding for entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid may result in increased costs and fees for programs such as medicare advantage plans and additional reductions in reimbursements to providers additionally amendments to the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the affordable care act implementation of the affordable care act and decisions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services could impact the delivery of services and benefits under medicare medicaid or medicare advantage plans and could affect our tenants and operators and the manner in which they are reimbursed by such programs such changes could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants operators and borrowers liquidity financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a materially adverse effect on us 		 		 			furthermore the supreme courts decision upholding the constitutionality of the individual healthcare mandate while striking down the provisions linking federal funding of state medicaid programs with a federally mandated expansion of those programs has contributed to the uncertainty regarding the impact that the law will have on healthcare delivery systems over the next decade we can expect that federal authorities will continue to implement the law but because of the supreme courts mixed ruling the implementation will take longer than originally expected with a commensurate increase in the period of uncertainty regarding the longterm financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare 		 		 			tenants and operators that fail to comply with federal state local and international laws and regulations including licensure certification and inspection requirements may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 		 		 			our tenants

loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the propertys investment potential in some cases the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating facilities and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity tenants operators or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure and we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully

obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be

materially adverse effect on our financial position debt covenant ratios results of operations and cash flow 		 		 			we may attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of derivative contracts or other methods for example we currently utilize gbp denominated liabilities as a natural hedge against our gbp denominated assets additionally we executed currency swap contracts to hedge the risk related to a portion of the forecasted interest receipts on these investments however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the failure to hedge effectively against foreign currency exchange rate risk if we choose to engage in such activities could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross

respect to certain transactions from this statute in the future the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons 		 		 			in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the maryland business combination act our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in certain circumstances business combinations including a merger or consolidation and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities with a related person including a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding voting stock 		 		 			the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law and contained in our charter may delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests 		 		 			unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 		 		 			from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our

terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we regularly review our insurance coverage however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters and may be subject to other losses in particular our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity while we purchase insurance coverage for earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analyses prepared by outside consultants such insurance may not fully cover such losses these losses can result in decreased anticipated revenues from a property and the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property following these events we may remain liable for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future in addition there are certain exposures for which we do not purchase insurance because we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market 		 		 			environmental compliance costs and

a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination the costs of cleanup and remediation could be substantial in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination 		 		 			although we currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount that we believe is commercially reasonable and generally require our tenants and operators to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property as the owner of a site we may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site including the release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us the cost of defending against these claims complying with environmental regulatory requirements conducting remediation of any contaminated property or paying personal injury or other claims or fines could be substantial and could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 		 		 			in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to use sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral 		 		 			we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 		 		 			we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information

would substantially reduce our available funds and would have materially adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock 		 		 			qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 		 		 			if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we will be subject to corporatelevel income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we could be subject to increased state and local income taxes and 		 			 				  			 		 			 			unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a reit 		 			as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 		 		 			the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with reits constantly are under review by persons involved in the legislative process the us internal revenue service the irs and the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments and affect the tax considerations of an investment in us 		 		 			we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 		 		 			if during the fiveyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize a gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition  		  		 			25 		   		 			table of contents 		 date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 		 		 			in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any 		 		 			there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits eampp in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute eampp 		 		 			in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit eampp of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such eampp distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such eampp distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such eampp distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of eampp including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit eampp moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit eampp which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 		 		 			thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit eampp by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our eampp we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so 		 		 			the lease of qualified healthcare properties to a taxable reit subsidiary or trs is subject to special requirements 		 		 			we may lease certain qualified healthcare properties to a trs which in turn contracts with a manager or related party to operate the property the rents from this trs lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if i they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified healthcare property with the trs and ii the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor as defined in the code if either of these conditions is not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents 		 		 			recent tax legislation impacts certain us federal income tax rules applicable to reits and could adversely affect our current tax positions 		 		 			the recently enacted protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 the act contains changes to certain aspects of the us federal income tax rules applicable to us the act is the most recent example of changes to the reit rules and additional legislative changes may occur that could adversely affect our current tax positions the act modifies various rules that apply to our ownership of and business relationship with our trss and reduces the maximum allowable value of our assets attributable to trss from 25 to 20 which could impact our ability to enter into future investments the act makes permanent the reduction of the recognition period from ten years to five years during which an entity that converted from a corporation to a reit or was acquired by a reit is subject to a corporatelevel tax on builtin gains recognized during such period which could influence the types of investments we enter into in the future the act also makes multiple changes related to the foreign investment in real property tax act or firpta expands prohibited transaction safe harbors and qualifying hedges and repeals the preferential dividend rule for public reits previously applicable to us lastly the act adjusts the way we may calculate certain earnings and profits calculations to avoid double taxation at the stockholder level and expands the types of qualifying assets and income for purposes of the reit requirements the provisions enacted by the act could result in changes in our tax positions or investments and future legislative changes related to those rules described above could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations

fourth quarter 2015 		 		 			the postacuteskilled nursing snf industry and hcrmc continued to experience a challenging operating environment in 2015 due to the ongoing change in reimbursement models which reduces rates and lowers census the result of shorter lengths of stay hcrmcs normalized fixed charge coverage for the 12month period ended december 31 2015 was 107x  		 		 			for the fourth quarter 2015 hcrmc reported normalized ebitdar of 110 million which decreased 36 million on a yearoveryear basis compared to the fourth quarter 2014 and decreased 17 million sequentially compared to the third quarter 2015 the results were impacted by core operating performance weakness and unfavorable nonroutine items discussed below the level of performance was below expectations and uncharacteristic for the fourth quarter which has historically been strong due in large part to increased census and the annual medicare rate increases on october 1 		 		 			hcrmc ended 2015 with 125 million of cash and cash equivalents and continues to be current on its obligations under the amended master lease the amended master lease  		 		 			 		  		 			37 		   		 			table of contents 		 core operating performance before the impact from nonroutine items described below hcrmcs fourth quarter ebitdar was below its forecast primarily due to the continued change in payor mix from traditional medicare to managed care plans which reduced reimbursement rates and lowered census as a result hcrmc reported a decline in its core snf operating metrics which excludes the 50 nonstrategic disposition assets with fourth quarter census decreasing 175 basis points from the prior year to 826 		 		 			nonroutine items as discussed below hcrmc is in the process of exiting 50 nonstrategic assets of which 21 sales were completed in the fourth quarter and an additional 11 closed in the first quarter 2016 as such disruption resulting from transitioning operations to new owners and closing costs led to additional underperformance from this pool of assets ebitdar losses from the sale of nonstrategic assets totaled 11 million in the fourth quarter 2015 and 22 million for full year 2015 hcp continues to expect total proceeds of 350 million from the sales of the nonstrategic assets of which 280 million have closed todate with the remaining 70 million expected to close in mid2016 		 		 			in addition hcrmc continues to defend against the doj civil complaint previously disclosed in april 2015 hcrmc incurred legal and regulatory defense costs of 3 million during the fourth quarter 2015 and 9 million for the full year 2015 the outcome of the doj civil complaint remains uncertain and hcrmc expects to incur additional legal and regulatory defense costs in 2016 		 		 			as a result of hcrmcs fourth quarter performance deterioration and the related decline in its fcc we placed our real estate portfolio operated by hcrmc on watch list status at year end 2015 and changed our accounting treatment to recognize rental income on a cash basis beginning january 2016 as such we will no longer recognize noncash accretion income under the hcrmc dfls see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 		 		 			the reduced growth outlook for the broader postacutesnf industry indicates challenges to the improvement in hcrmcs financial performance over the next few years at year end 2015 the company determined that it is probable that its hcrmc dfl investments are impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the fourth quarter 2015 the company recorded an allowance impairment charge for dfl losses of 817 million reducing the carrying amount of its hcrmc dfl investments from 60 billion to 52 billion see notes 6 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements we also recorded a fourth quarter 2015 impairment charge of 19 million related to our equity investment in hcrmc opco see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 		 		 			hcp has engaged advisors and continues to work closely with hcrmc to jointly explore all opportunities that reduce our concentration improve the credit quality and coverage of our amended master lease and ensure hcrmc can continue to deliver high quality care and services 		 		 			hcrmc third quarter 2015 		 		 			in october 2015 we concluded that our equity investment in hcrmc was otherthantemporarily impaired as of september 30 2015 and we recorded an impairment charge of 27 million during the third quarter of 2015 the impairment charge reduced the carrying amount of our equity investment in hcrmc to 21 million our impairment determination primarily resulted from our review of hcrmc operating results and market and industry data which among other factors showed a declining trend in admissions from hospitals and continuing trends in mix and length of stay driven by medicare advantage and other manage care plans 		 		 			hcrmc first quarter 2015 		 		 			during the quarter ended march 31 2015 hcp and hcrmc agreed to market for sale the real estate and operations associated with 50 nonstrategic facilities that were under the master lease and security agreement the master lease for an estimated total gross sales price of approximately 350 million hcrmc receives annual rent reduction under the master lease based on 775 of the net sales proceeds received by hcp during the year ended december 31 2015 we completed sales of 22 nonstrategic hcrmc facilities for 219 million through february 8 2016 33 of the facility sales have closed and the remaining facility sales are expected to close mid2016 		 		 			additionally hcp and hcrmc agreed to amend the master lease the hcrmc lease amendment commencing april 1 2015 hcp provided an annual net rent reduction of 68 million which equates to initial lease year rent of 473 million compared to 541 million that would have commenced april 1 2015 prior to the hcrmc lease  		  		 			38 		   		 			table of contents 		 amendment the contractual rent will increase by 30 annually during the initial term in exchange hcp received the following consideration 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			fee ownership in nine postacute facilities valued at 275 million with a median age of four years owned and operated by hcrmc hcp retained a lease receivable of equal value earning income of 19 million annually included in the amended initial lease year rent of 473 million above which will be reduced as the facility purchases are completed following the purchase of a facility hcrmc will lease such facility from hcp pursuant to the amended master lease the nine facilities will contribute an aggregate of 19 million of annual rent subject to escalation under the amended master lease during the year ended december 31 2015 and through february 8 2016 hcrmc and hcp completed seven of the nine facility purchases for 184 million the purchases of the remaining two facilities are expected to close mid2016 subject to customary licensing

years to an average of 16 years 		 			  		 		 			in march 2015 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 478 million related to our hcrmc dfl investments the noncash charge reduced the carrying value of the hcrmc dfl investments from 66 billion to 61 billion which represented the present value of the future lease payments under the amended master lease the impairment determination resulted from discussions with hcrmc in which they expressed an increasing desire to reduce rent in consideration of potential economic trades to hcp prior to the april 1 2015 rental increase of 35 under the master lease without regard to the hcrmc lease amendment 		 		 			  		 		 			see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the hcrmc lease amendment and impairment of our

net income loss as presented in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements management believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline rents dfl accretion amortization of market lease intangibles and lease termination fees adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as cash noi we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations assess and compare

supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 		 		 			ffo as defined by the nareit is net income loss applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and other depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income loss we compute ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition however other reits may report ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours  		 		 			in addition we present ffo before the impact of severancerelated charges litigation settlement charges preferred stock redemption charges impairments recoveries of nondepreciable assets foreign currency remeasurement losses gains and transactionrelated items defined below ffo as adjusted transactionrelated items include acquisition and pursuit costs eg due diligence and closing and gainscharges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental

amortization reduction of straightline rents and vi deferred revenues excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements ownedrecognized by us and

other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating fad and accordingly our fad may not be comparable to those reported by other reits although our fad computation may

which we present as a noncash joint venture fad adjustment see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 		 			  		 		 			 		  		 			60 		   		 			table of contents 		 critical accounting policies 		 		 			the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 		 		 			  		 		 			principles of consolidation 		 		 			the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 		 		 			we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support or iii substantially all of the entitys activities involve or are performed on behalf of an equity investor that holds disproportionately few voting rights we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entitys governing body the size and seniority of our investment and our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a reanalysis of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the vie our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 		 		 			if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie we would require the vie to provide us timely financial information and would review the internal controls of the vie to determine if we could rely on the financial information it provides if the vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting 		 		 			revenue recognition 		 		 			at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying propertys economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs is equal to 90 or more of the excess estimated fair value over retained tax credits of the leased asset if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease if the assumptions utilized in the above  		  		 			61 		   		 			table of contents 		 classifications assessments were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of a tenant improvement is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 		 		 			certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent is dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for operating lease straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent receivable amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of future minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unamortized unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment if these assessments were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 		 		 			loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans if management determined that certain loans should no longer be classified as heldforinvestment the timing and amount of our interest income recognized would be impacted 		 		 			loans receivable and dfls collectively finance receivables are reviewed and assigned an internal rating of performing watch list or workout finance receivables that are deemed performing meet all present contractual obligations and collection and timing of all amounts owed is reasonably assured watch list finance receivables are defined as finance receivables that do not meet the definition of performing or workout workout finance receivables are defined as finance receivables in which the company has determined based on current information and events that it is probable i it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement ii the tenant operator or borrower is delinquent on making payments under the contractual terms of the agreement iii and the company has commenced action or anticipates pursuing action in the near term to seek recovery of its investment 		 		 			 		  		 			62 		   		 			table of contents 		 finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured the asset will have an internal rating of either watch list or workout further we perform a credit analysis to support the tenants operators borrowers andor guarantors repayment capacity and the underlying collateral values we use the cash basis method of accounting for finance receivables placed on nonaccrual status unless one of the following conditions exist whereby we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting i if we determine that it is probable that we will only recover the recorded investment in the finance receivable net of associated allowances or chargeoffs if any or ii we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of an impaired finance receivable for cash basis method of accounting we apply payments received excluding principal paydowns to interest income so long as that amount does not exceed the amount that would have been earned under the original contractual terms for cost recovery method of accounting any payment received is applied to reduce the recorded investment generally we return a finance receivable to accrual status when all delinquent payments become current under the terms of the loan or lease agreements and collectibility of the remaining contractual loan or lease payments is reasonably assured 		 		 			allowances are established for finance receivables on an individual basis utilizing an estimate of probable losses if they are determined to be impaired finance receivables are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessees or borrowers overall financial condition economic resources payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivables effective interest rate fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors as appropriate should a finance receivable be deemed partially or wholly uncollectible the uncollectible balance is charged off against the allowance in the period in which the uncollectible determination has been made 		 		 			real estate 		 		 			we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of allocating fair value to inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases 		 		 			a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project to be considered substantially complete and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 		 		 			impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 		 		 			we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be recoverable but at least annually recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 		 		 			 		  		 			63 		   		 			table of contents 		 goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually based on certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount potential impairment indicators and qualitative factors include a significant decline in real estate valuations restructuring plans current macroeconomic conditions state of the equity and capital markets or a significant decline in the value of our market capitalization if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we apply the required twostep quantitative approach the quantitative procedures of the twostep approach i compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill and if necessary ii compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities excluding goodwill is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment if any we estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques including applying capitalization rates to segment net operating income quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals as necessary the fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company 		 		 			the determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results resulting cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 		 		 			investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 		 		 			the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment indicators based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of a fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 		 		 			  		 		 			income taxes 		 		 			as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential for builtin gain recognition and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision 		 		 			recent accounting pronouncements 		 		 			see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new
