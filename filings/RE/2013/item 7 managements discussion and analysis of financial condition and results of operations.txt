  safe harbor disclosure         8      table of contents      underwriting one of the companys strategies is to lead as many of the reinsurance treaties it underwrites as possible the company leads on approximately twothirds of its treaty reinsurance business as measured by premium the lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in the strongest position to negotiate price terms and conditions management believes this strategy enables it to obtain more favorable terms and conditions on the treaties on which it participates when the company does not lead the treaty it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty the company may decline to participate on a treaty based upon its assessment of all relevant factors   the companys treaty underwriting process involves a team approach among the companys underwriters actuaries and claim staff treaties are reviewed for compliance with the companys general underwriting standards and most larger treaties are subjected to detailed actuarial analysis the actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the subject exposures and loss experience the company does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties the company does however evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty the company may also conduct underwriting operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding companies to monitor adherence to underwriting guidelines underwriting audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff pricing and risk selection and rate monitoring over time claim audits may be performed in order to evaluate the clients claims handling abilities and practices   the companys facultative underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks limits and maximum risk exposures specified classes of large premium us risks are referred to everest res new york facultative headquarters for specific review before premium quotations are given to clients in addition the companys guidelines require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate limits complexity or volatility regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract nonus risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within the involved operations   the companys insurance operations principally write casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through select program managers these programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and the program managers capabilities the companys rates forms and underwriting guidelines are tailored to specific risk types the companys underwriting actuarial claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate performance monitoring mechanisms   risk management of underwriting and retrocession arrangements   underwriting risk and accumulation controls each segment and business unit manages its underwriting risk in accordance with established guidelines these guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors including ceding company profile line of business geographic location and risk hazards in each case the guidelines permit limited exceptions which must be authorized by the companys senior management management regularly reviews and revises these guidelines in response to changes in business unit market conditions risk versus reward analyses and the companys enterprise and underwriting risk management processes   the operating results and financial condition of the company can be adversely affected by catastrophe and other large losses the company manages its exposure to catastrophes and other large losses by           selective

retrocession arrangements            9      table of contents      like other insurance and reinsurance companies the company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence whether a natural event such as a hurricane or an earthquake or other catastrophe such as an explosion at a major factory a large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties facultative certificates and across lines of business   the company focuses on potential losses that could result from any single event or series of events as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events accordingly the company employs various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain from any single catastrophic event or series of events in various geographic areas these techniques range from deterministic approaches such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastropheprone zones and applying reasonable damage factors to modeled approaches that attempt to scientifically measure catastrophe loss exposure using sophisticated monte carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis   no single computer model or group of models is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which the company conducts business in addition the form quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for the companys licensed models which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections further the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business units also while most models have been updated to incorporate claims information from recent catastrophic events catastrophe model projections are still inherently imprecise in addition uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles add to the already significant uncertainty of loss projections from models using historic long term frequency and severity data   nevertheless when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events   projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss pml the company defines pml as its anticipated loss taking into account contract terms and limits caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake the pml will vary depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the makeup of the in force book of business the projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods such as 100year events and 250year events for example a 100year pml is the estimated loss to the current inforce portfolio from a single event which has a 1 probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period in other words it corresponds to a 99 probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated pml it is important to note that pmls are estimates modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model as a result there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event pml   from an enterprise risk management perspective management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure the company may underwrite the limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors including but not limited to the companys financial resources and expected earnings and riskreward analyses of the business being underwritten   management estimates that the projected net economic loss from its largest 100year event in a given zone represents approximately 10 of its projected 2013 shareholders equity economic loss is the gross pml reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and estimated income taxes the impact of income taxes on the pml depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity which is also affected by interaffiliate reinsurance management also monitors and controls its largest pmls at multiple points along the loss distribution curve such as loss amounts at the 20 50 100 250 500 and 1000 year return periods this process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk underwriting and capital management decisions         10      table of

availability of costeffective protection for the period from august 1 2012 to july 31 2013 the company has catastrophe loss reinsurance protection in place for losses arising from earthquakes of 61 of 100 million in excess of 190 million excluding the territories of the us japan and europe the company continues to evaluate the availability and cost of various retrocessional products and loss mitigation approaches in the marketplace   the company believes that its methods of monitoring analyzing and managing catastrophe exposures provide a credible risk management framework which are integrated with its enterprise risk management underwriting and capital management plans however there is much uncertainty and imprecision inherent in the catastrophe models and the catastrophe loss estimation process generally as a result there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses from individual events that exceed the pml or other return period projections perhaps by a material amount nor can there be assurance that the company will not experience events impacting multiple zones or multiple severe events that could in the aggregate exceed the companys pml expectations by a significant amount   terrorism risk  the company has limited exposure to losses from terrorism risk while the company writes some reinsurance contracts covering terrorism the companys risk management philosophy is to limit the amount of exposure by geographic region and to strictly manage coverage for properties in areas that may be considered a target for terrorists although providing terrorism coverage on reinsurance contracts is negotiable most insurance policies mandate inclusion of terrorism coverage as a result the company is exposed to losses from terrorism on its insurance book of business particularly its workers compensation and property policies however the insurance book generally does not insure large corporations or corporate locations that represent large concentrations of risk   because of the limited nature of terrorism exposure the us terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 and its amendments do not have a significant impact on company operations         11      table of contents      reinsurance and retrocession arrangements  the company does not typically purchase significant retrocessional coverage for specific reinsurance business written but it will do so when management deems it to be prudent andor costeffective to reinsure a portion of the risks being assumed the company participates in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties whereby a ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its reinsurers under one or more of its reinsurance treaties common account retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies including the ceding company with respect to the involved treaties   the company typically considers the purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance program exposures written by the insurance segment the type of reinsurance coverage considered is dependent upon individual risk exposures individual program exposures aggregate exposures by line of business overall segment and corporate wide exposures and the cost effectiveness of available reinsurance facultative reinsurance will typically be considered for large individual exposures and quota share reinsurance will generally be considered for entire programs of business   the company also considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection covering the potential accumulation of exposures such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the availability of costeffective retrocessional protection   all of the companys reinsurance and retrocessional agreements transfer significant reinsurance risk and therefore are accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance   at december 31 2012 the company had 6591 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to both paid and unpaid losses ceded of this amount 1815 million or

or 88 was receivable from berkley insurance company berkley and 541 million or 82 was receivable from transatlantic reinsurance company transatlantic the receivable from cv starr is fully collateralized by a trust agreement no other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5 of the companys receivables although management carefully selects its reinsurers the company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve the company of its liability to insureds or ceding companies see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition   claims reinsurance claims are managed by the companys professional claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial loss reports and coverage issues monitoring claims handling activities of ceding companies establishing and adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of claims in addition to claims assessment processing and payment the claims staff selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies insurance claims except those relating to mt mckinleys business are generally handled by third party claims service providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the companys professional claims staff   the company intensively manages its asbestos and environmental aampe exposures through dedicated centrally managed claim staffs for mt mckinley and everest re both

occurrence of an insured loss the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the insurer by the reinsurer to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and lae insurers and reinsurers establish reserves which are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses for losses that have already occurred actual losses and lae paid may deviate perhaps substantially from such reserves to the extent reserves prove to be insufficient to cover actual losses and lae after taking into account available reinsurance coverage the company would have to recognize such reserve shortfalls and incur a charge to earnings which could be material in the period such recognition takes place see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  loss and lae reserves   as part of the reserving process insurers and reinsurers evaluate historical data and trends and make judgments as to the impact of various factors such as legislative and judicial developments that may affect future claim amounts changes in social and political attitudes that may increase loss exposures and inflationary and general economic trends while the reserving process is difficult and subjective for insurance companies the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer due primarily to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies in addition trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development in the same manner or to the same degree in the future as a result actual losses and lae may deviate perhaps substantially from estimates of reserves reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements   like many other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies the company has experienced adverse loss development for prior accident years which has led to increases in losses and lae reserves and corresponding charges to income loss in the periods in which the adjustments were made there can be no assurance that adverse development from prior years will not continue in the future or that such adverse development will not have a material adverse effect on net income loss   changes in historical reserves the following table shows changes in historical loss reserves for the company for 2002 and subsequent years the table is presented on a gaap basis except that the companys loss reserves for its canadian branch operations are presented in canadian dollars the impact of which is not material the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and lae recorded at each year end date the upper paid portion of the table presents the related cumulative amounts paid through each subsequent year end the lower liability reestimated portion shows the reestimated amount of the original reserves as of the end of each succeeding year the reserve estimates have been revised as more information became known about the actual claims for which the reserves were carried the cumulative deficiencyredundancy line represents the cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was established it is equal to the initial reserve less the latest estimate of the ultimate liability   since the company has

loss minus original estimate would affect the cumulative deficiency for each of the years in 2003 through 2005 conditions and trends that have affected development of the ultimate liability in the

principal contributors to the deficiencies through 2006 1 the runoff of asbestos claims for both direct and reinsurance business has significantly contributed to the cumulative deficiencies for all years presented through 2006 2 professional liability reinsurance general casualty reinsurance and workers compensation insurance contributed to the deficiencies for years 2002 and 2003 and 3 property catastrophe adverse development contributed to the deficiency for 2005   in 2007 the company completed a detailed study of its asbestos experience and its cedants asbestos exposures and also considered industry trends as a result of the study the company increased its gross reinsurance asbestos reserves by 2500 million and increased its gross direct asbestos reserves by 750 million these reserve increases as well as adverse development on asbestos in prior years have a significant impact on the cumulative deficiencies subsequent to the study the companys loss activity has been in line with expectations per the reserves established at december 31 2007 the companys aampe reserves represent managements best estimate of the ultimate liability however there can be no assurance that ultimate loss payments will not exceed such reserves perhaps by a significant amount no additional gross aampe reserve strengthening was made during 2008 through 2010 and only an insignificant amount of development occurred in 2011 and 2012   in the professional liability reinsurance class the early 2000s saw a proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other corporate financial andor management improprieties this resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of claims under the professional liability policies reinsured by the company in the general casualty area the company has experienced claim frequency and severity greater than expected in the companys pricing and initial reserving assumptions   in the workers compensation insurance class the majority of which was written in california the company has experienced adverse development primarily for accident year 2002 due to higher than expected claim frequency and severity as a result of significant growth in this book of business in a challenging business environment the companys writings in this class were subject to more relative variability than in some of its established andor stable lines of business although cumulative results through 2012 continue to be profitable for this book of business there was some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident year 2002   the adverse development on the 2008 outstanding reserves was primarily attributable to foreign exchange rate movements resulting in an increase in the us dollar reserves in addition the company experienced adverse development on liability exposures for subprime for accident years 20062008 and contractors liability exposures for accident years 20022005 the contractor liability exposures are currently in runoff the company also experienced adverse development on property lines but was offset by favorable development on other casualty lines   the companys loss and lae reserves represent managements best estimate of the ultimate liability while there can be no assurance that these reserves will not need to be increased in the future management believes that the companys existing reserves and reserving methodologies reduce the likelihood that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows these statements

  the reserve development by accident year reflected in the above table was generally the result of the same factors described above that caused the deficiencies shown in the ten year gaap loss development table the unfavorable development experienced in the 2002 and prior accident years relate principally to the previously discussed asbestos development other business areas contributing to adverse development were casualty reinsurance including professional liability classes and workers compensation insurance where in retrospect the companys initial estimates of losses were underestimated principally as the result of unanticipated variability in the underlying exposures the favorable development for accident years 2003 through 2004 relates primarily to favorable experience with respect to property reinsurance business in addition casualty reinsurance has reflected favorable development for accident years 2003 to 2006   the companys loss reserving methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of loss and loss development trends seeking on a timely basis to both adjust reserves for the impact of trend shifts and to factor the impact of such shifts into the companys underwriting and pricing on a prospective basis         16      table of contents      the following table presents a reconciliation of beginning and ending reserve balances

37 million increased by 37 million and decreased by 309 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease for 2012 was attributable to a 572 million decrease in reinsurance business primarily related to favorable development on treaty casualty reserves partially offset by a 535 million increase in insurance business primarily related to development on contractors liability and workers compensation reserves   the increase for 2011 was attributable to a 1138 million increase in the insurance and us reinsurance business primarily related to development on contractors liability excess casualty and california workers compensation reserves partially offset by a 1101 million decrease in nonus reinsurance business primarily related to favorable development on noncatastrophe property reserves   the decrease for 2010 was attributable to a 1408 million decrease in nonus reinsurance business bermuda and international partially offset by the 1099 million increase in the insurance and us reinsurance business the decrease in the nonus reinsurance business was due to reserve studies that indicated net favorable reserve development as well as reductions in loss estimates for prior year catastrophes the increase in the us reinsurance business is primarily due to reserve strengthening in casualty lines for construction liability claims and the increase in the insurance business is due to reserve strengthening on several terminated programs   reserves for asbestos and environmental losses and lae at december 31 2012 the companys gross reserves for aampe claims represented 44 of its total reserves the companys aampe liabilities stem from mt mckinleys direct insurance business and everest res assumed reinsurance business there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the companys potential losses from aampe claims and ultimate values cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  asbestos and environmental exposures and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements   mt mckinleys book of direct aampe exposed insurance policies is relatively small and homogenous it arises from a limited period from 1975 to 1984 the book was principally excess liability thereby limiting exposure analysis to a limited number of policies and forms as a result of this focused structure the company believes that it is able to comprehensively analyze its exposures allowing it to identify analyze and actively monitor those claims which have unusual exposure including policies on which it may be exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits or on which nonproducts coverage may be contended         17      table of contents      the company endeavors to actively engage with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to mt mckinley such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement negotiation litigation or the monitoring of claim activity under settlement in place sip agreements sip agreements generally condition an insurers payment upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other measures to control the insurers payments the companys mt mckinley operation is currently managing four sip agreements one of which was executed prior to the acquisition of mt mckinley in 2000 the companys preference with respect to coverage settlements is to execute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty   the company has significantly enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics over time as well as its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active those insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous but still active management with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics which may indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity the company continually focuses on further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential exposure of policyholders   everest res book of assumed aampe reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a limited number of contracts and for a limited period from 1974 to 1984 because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the company has been managing the aampe exposures for many years its claim staff is familiar with the ceding companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to generate future liabilities the companys claim staff has developed familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims handling and reserving practices of those companies this level of familiarity enhances the quality of the companys analysis of its exposure through those companies as a result the company believes that it can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure such as nonproducts asbestos claims for concentrated attention however in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities the company relies on claims data supplied both formally and informally by its ceding companies and brokers this furnished information is not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeliness of the companys ultimate loss projections   the

funded by shareholders equity to include 1 a greater percentage of publicly traded equity securities 2 emerging market fixed maturities through mutual fund structures as well as individual holdings 3 high yield fixed maturities 4 bank loan securities and 5 private equity limited partnership investments the objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the riskadjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes which are also less subject to changes in value with movements in interest rates the company limits its allocation to these asset classes because of 1 the potential for volatility in their values and 2 the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models the company uses investment managers experienced in these markets and adjusts its allocation to these investments based upon market conditions at december 31 2012 the market value of investments in these investment market sectors carried at both market and fair value approximated 63 of shareholders equity   the duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early prepayments the companys fixed income investment guidelines include a general duration guideline this investment duration guideline is established and

at december 31 2012 and 2011 was 30 years the company has shortened the duration of its portfolio in recent years in response to very low available yields particularly on securities with longer maturities as a result the company has focused on purchasing high quality shorter duration investments and investments with floating rate yields these investments will be less subject to decline in market value if interest rates rise in the future as forecasted by most investment analysts   for each currency in which the company has established substantial loss and lae reserves the company seeks

realized capital gains from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities partially offset by 30 million of otherthantemporary impairments on fixed maturity securities the gains on the sales of fixed

of february 28 2013   the company believes that its ratings in general are important to its operations because they provide the companys customers and investors with an independent assessment of the companys underlying financial strength using a scale that provides for relative comparisons strong financial ratings are particularly important for reinsurance companies ceding companies must rely on

affect on the companys business   competition the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive as well as cyclical by product and market as such financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of constrained availability high rates and strong profits followed by periods of abundant capacity low rates and constrained profitability competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that the company underwrites is based on many factors including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by am best andor standard amp poors underwriting expertise the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized capacity and coverages offered premiums charged other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered services offered speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written furthermore the market impact from these competitive factors related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels   the company competes in the us bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors the companys competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations including underwriting syndicates at lloyds some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company and have established long term and continuing business relationships which can be a significant competitive advantage in addition the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition   worldwide insurance and reinsurance market conditions continued to be very competitive particularly in the casualty lines of business generally there was ample insurance and reinsurance capacity relative to demand competition and its effect on rates terms and conditions vary widely by market and coverage yet continued to be most prevalent in the us casualty insurance and reinsurance markets         24      table of contents     however during the fourth quarter of 2012 the industry sustained significant losses from superstorm sandy and also sustained significant losses during 2011 from australian floods the new zealand earthquake the earthquake and tsunami in japan storms in the us and the thailand floods it is too early to determine the longer term impact on market conditions as a result of these events while the 2011 events have resulted in meaningful rate increases for catastrophe coverages in some global catastrophe prone regions particularly areas impacted by these losses whether the magnitude of these 2012 and 2011 losses is sufficient to increase rates and improve market conditions for other lines of business remains to be seen   overall the company believes that current marketplace conditions particularly for catastrophe coverages provide profit opportunities for it given its strong ratings distribution system reputation and expertise the company continues to employ its strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit potential

compliance with applicable conduct of business regulations   naic riskbased capital requirements the us national association of insurance commissioners naic has developed a formula to measure the amount of capital appropriate for a property and casualty insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile the major categories of a companys risk profile are its asset risk credit risk and underwriting risk the standards are an effort by the naic to prevent insolvencies to ward off other financial difficulties of insurance companies and to establish uniform regulatory standards among state insurance departments   under the approved formula a companys statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital rbc if this ratio is above a minimum threshold no action is necessary below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which an insurers domiciliary state regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over an insurer as the ratio of surplus to rbc decreases the mildest intervention requires an insurer to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions the most severe action requires an insurer to be rehabilitated or liquidated   based on their financial positions at december 31 2012 everest re everest national everest indemnity and everest security significantly exceed the minimum thresholds

investment in our securities if the circumstances contemplated by the individual risk factors materialize our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly   risks relating to our business   fluctuations in the financial markets could result in investment losses   prolonged and severe disruptions in the public debt and equity markets such as occurred during 2008 could result in significant realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio for the year ended december 31 2008 we incurred 6958 million of realized investment losses and 3104 million of unrealized investment losses although financial markets have significantly improved since 2008 they could deteriorate in the future such declines in the financial markets could result in significant realized and unrealized losses on investments and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations equity business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings         28      table of contents      our results could be adversely affected by catastrophic events   we are exposed to unpredictable catastrophic events including weatherrelated and other natural catastrophes as well as acts of terrorism any material reduction in our operating results caused by the occurrence of one or more catastrophes could inhibit our ability to pay dividends or to meet our interest and principal payment obligations subsequent to april 1 2010 we define a catastrophe as an event that causes a loss on property exposures before reinsurance of at least 100 million before corporate level reinsurance and taxes prior to april 1 2010 we used a threshold of 50 million by way of illustration during the past five calendar years pretax catastrophe losses net of contract specific reinsurance but before cessions under corporate reinsurance programs were as follows       calendar year  pretax catastrophe losses   dollars in millions          2012     4100     2011      13004     2010      5711     2009      674     2008      3643       our losses from future catastrophic events could exceed our projections   we use projections of possible losses from future catastrophic events of varying types and magnitudes as a strategic underwriting tool we use these loss projections to estimate our potential catastrophe losses in certain geographic areas and decide on the purchase of retrocessional coverage or other actions to limit the extent of potential losses in a given geographic area these loss projections are approximations reliant on a mix of quantitative and qualitative processes and actual losses may exceed the projections by a material amount resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations   if our loss reserves are inadequate to meet our actual losses our net income would be reduced or we could incur a loss   we are required to maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liability of losses and lae for both reported and unreported claims incurred these reserves are only estimates of what we believe the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances known to us in setting reserves for our reinsurance liabilities we rely on claim data supplied by our ceding companies and brokers and we employ actuarial and statistical projections the information received from our ceding companies is not always timely or accurate which can contribute to inaccuracies in our loss projections because of the uncertainties that surround our estimates of loss and lae reserves we cannot be certain that ultimate losses and lae payments will not exceed our estimates if our reserves are deficient we would be required to increase loss reserves in the period in which such deficiencies are identified which would cause a charge to our earnings and a reduction of capital by way of illustration during the past five calendar years the reserve reestimation process resulted in a decrease to our pretax net income in three of the years       calendar year  effect on pretax net income     dollars in millions              2012     37    increase    2011      37    decrease    2010      309    increase    2009      1288    decrease    2008      349    decrease      see item 1 business  changes in historical reserves which provides a more detailed chart showing the effect of reserve reestimates on calendar year operating results for the past ten years          29      table of contents      the difficulty in estimating our reserves is significantly more challenging as it relates to reserving for potential aampe liabilities at yearend 2012 44 of our gross reserves were comprised of aampe reserves aampe liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons including the long delays between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental contamination long reporting delays and difficulty in properly allocating liability for the asbestos or environmental damage legal tactics and judicial and legislative developments affecting the scope of insurers liability which can be difficult to predict also contribute to uncertainties in estimating reserves for aampe liabilities   the failure to accurately assess underwriting risk and establish adequate premium rates could reduce our net income or result in a net loss   our success depends on our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained if we fail to accurately assess the risks we retain we may fail to establish adequate premium rates to cover our losses and lae this could reduce our net income and even result in a net loss   in addition losses may arise from events or exposures that are not anticipated when the coverage is priced in addition to unanticipated events we also face the unanticipated expansion of our exposures particularly in longtail liability lines an example of this is the expansion over time of the scope of insurers legal liability within the mass tort arena particularly for aampe exposures discussed above   decreases in pricing for property and casualty reinsurance and insurance could reduce our net income   the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive as well as cyclical by product and market these cycles as well as other factors that influence aggregate supply and demand for property and casualty insurance and reinsurance products are outside of our control the supply of reinsurance is driven by prevailing prices and levels of capacity that may fluctuate in response to a number of factors including large catastrophic losses and investment returns being realized in the insurance industry demand for reinsurance is influenced by underwriting results of insurers and insureds including catastrophe losses and prevailing general economic conditions if any of these factors were to result in a decline in the demand for reinsurance or an overall increase in reinsurance capacity our net income could decrease   if rating agencies downgrade the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries future prospects for growth and profitability could be significantly and adversely affected   our active insurance company subsidiaries currently hold financial strength ratings assigned by thirdparty rating agencies which assess and rate the claims paying ability and financial strength of insurers and reinsurers our active subsidiaries carry an a superior rating from am best everest re bermuda re ireland re and everest national hold an a strong rating from standard amp poors everest re and bermuda re hold an aa3 excellent rating from moodys financial strength ratings are used by client companies and agents and brokers that place the business as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers a downgrade or withdrawal of any of these ratings might adversely affect our ability to market our insurance products and could have a material and adverse effect on future prospects for growth and profitability   on january 24 2012 moodys affirmed the ratings of our operating subsidiaries but changed the outlook on the ratings from stable to negative reflecting their opinion of the likely direction of the ratings over the medium term 12 to 18 months we will continue to work with moodys over this time to address their concerns but it is not possible to predict the potential outcome   on march 13 2009 standard amp poors downgraded its ratings of everest re bermuda re and everest national one level to a it is possible that a further downgrade will occur in the future if we do not continue to meet the evolving criteria expected of our current rating in that regard several of the rating agencies are in the process of modifying their approaches to evaluating enterprise risk management and its impact on ratings therefore we cannot predict the outcome of this reassessment or its potential impact upon our ratings         30      table of contents     consistent with market practice much of our treaty reinsurance business allows the ceding company to terminate the contract or seek collateralization of our obligations in the event of a rating downgrade below a certain threshold the termination provision would generally be triggered if a rating fell below am bests a rating level which is three levels below everest res current rating of a to a lesser extent everest re also has modest exposure to reinsurance contracts that contain provisions for obligatory funding of outstanding liabilities in the event of a rating agency downgrade those provisions would also generally be triggered if everest res rating fell below am bests a rating level   the failure of our insureds intermediaries and reinsurers to satisfy their obligations to us could reduce our income   in accordance with industry practice we have uncollateralized receivables from insureds agents and brokers andor rely on agents and brokers to process our payments we may not be able to collect amounts due from insureds agents and brokers resulting in a reduction to net income   we are subject to credit risk of reinsurers in connection with retrocessional arrangements because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve us of our liability to the insured in addition reinsurers may be unwilling to pay us even though they are able to do so the failure of one or more of our reinsurers to honor their obligations to us in a timely fashion would impact our cash flow and reduce our net income and could cause us to incur a significant loss   if we are unable or choose not to purchase reinsurance and transfer risk to reinsurers our net income could be reduced or we could incur a net loss in the event of unusual loss experience   we are generally less reliant on the purchase of reinsurance than many of our competitors in part because of our strategic emphasis on underwriting discipline and management of the cycles inherent in our business we try to separate our risk taking process from our risk mitigation process in order to avoid developing too great a reliance on reinsurance we generally purchase reinsurance from other third parties only when we expect a net benefit the percentage of business that we reinsure may vary considerably from year to year depending on our view of the relationship between cost and expected benefit for the contract period         2012   2011   2010   2009   2008    percentage of ceded written premiums to gross written premiums   53     41     61     48     47        changes in the availability and cost of reinsurance which are subject to market conditions that are outside of our control have reduced to some extent our ability to use reinsurance to tailor the risks we assume on a contract or program basis or to mitigate or balance exposures across our reinsurance operations because we have purchased minimal reinsurance in recent years our net income could be reduced following a large unreinsured event or adverse overall claims experience   our industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future   our industry is highly competitive and subject to pricing cycles that can be pronounced we compete globally in the united states bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous competitors our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations including underwriting syndicates at lloyds         31      table of contents     according to standard amp poors we rank among the top ten global reinsurance groups where more than twothirds of the market share is concentrated the worldwide net premium written by the traditional reinsurance market for both life and nonlife business was estimated to be 174 billion in 2011 according to data compiled by standard amp poors the top twentyfive groups in our industry represent just over 90 of these revenues the leaders in this market are munich re swiss re berkshire hathaway inc hannover ruckversicherung ag and syndicates at lloyds some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry which can be a significant competitive advantage in addition the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition   we are dependent on our key personnel   our success has been and will continue to be dependent on our ability to retain the services of existing key executive officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future the loss of the services of any key executive officer or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct business generally we consider key executive officers to be those individuals who have the greatest influence in setting overall policy and controlling operations chairman and chief executive officer joseph v taranto age 63 president dominic j addesso age 59 and executive vice president and chief financial officer craig howie age 49 we currently have employment contracts with mr taranto and mr addesso mr tarantos contract was filed with the sec and provides for terms of employment ending on december 31 2013 mr addessos contract was filed with the sec and provides for terms of employment ending december 31 2016   special considerations apply to our bermuda operations under bermuda law nonbermudians other than spouses of bermudians and individuals holding permanent or working resident certificates are not permitted to engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without a work permit issued by the bermuda government a work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show that after a proper public advertisement no bermudian spouse of a bermudian or individual holding a permanent or working resident certificate is available who meets the minimum standards reasonably required for the position the bermuda government places a sixyear term limit on individuals with work permits subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be key employees of businesses with a significant physical presence in bermuda currently all four of our bermudabased professional employees who require work permits have been granted permits by the bermuda government that expire at various times between september 2013 and may 2015 this includes mark de saram the chief executive officer of our bermuda reinsurance operation in the event his work permit were not renewed we could lose his services thereby adversely affecting our ability to conduct our business in bermuda until we were able to replace him with an individual in bermuda who did not require a work permit or who was granted the permit the company has an employment contract with mr de saram which was filed with the sec and provides for term of employment ending on november 1 2014   our investment values and investment income could decline because they are exposed to interest rate credit and market risks   a significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and smaller portions consist of equity securities and other investments both the fair market value of our invested assets and associated investment income fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions for example the fair market value of our predominant fixed income portfolio generally increases or decreases inversely to fluctuations in interest rates the market value of our fixed income securities could also decrease as a result of a downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of such securities to deteriorate the net investment income that we realize from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates   interest rate fluctuations also can cause net investment income from fixed income investments that carry prepayment risk such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities to differ from the income anticipated from those securities at the time of purchase in addition if issuers of individual investments are unable to meet their obligations investment income will be reduced and realized capital losses may arise         32      table of contents     the majority of our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale and temporary changes in the market value of these investments are reflected as changes to our shareholders equity our actively managed equity security portfolios are fair valued and any changes in fair value are reflected as net realized capital gains or losses as a result a decline in the value of our securities reduces our capital or could cause us to incur a loss   we have invested a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities the value of these assets fluctuates with changes in the markets in times of economic weakness the fair value of these assets may decline and may negatively impact net income we also invest in nontraditional investments which have different risk characteristics than traditional fixed income and equity securities these alternative investments are comprised primarily of private equity limited partnerships the changes in value and investment incomeloss for these partnerships may be more volatile than overthecounter securities   the following table quantifies the portion of our investment portfolio that consists of fixed income securities equity securities and investments that

conduct business in a variety of foreign nonus currencies principally the euro the british pound the canadian dollar and the singapore dollar assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates our functional currency is the us dollar and exchange rate fluctuations relative to the us dollar may materially impact our results and financial position in 2012 we wrote approximately 310 of our coverages in nonus currencies as of december 31 2012 we maintained approximately 173 of our investment portfolio in investments denominated in nonus currencies during 2012 2011 and 2010 the impact on our quarterly pretax net income from exchange rate fluctuations ranged from a loss of 170 million to a gain of 318 million   we are subject to cybersecurity risks that could negatively impact our business operations    we are dependent upon our information technology platform including our processing systems data and electronic transmissions in our business operations security breaches could expose us to the loss or misuse of our information litigation and potential liability in addition cyber incidents that impact the availability reliability speed accuracy or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant negative impact on our operations and possibly our results an incident could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws damage our reputation cause a loss of customers or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties which could be significant management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our operations          33      table of contents     risks relating to regulation   insurance laws and regulations restrict our ability to operate and any failure to comply with those laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business   we are subject to extensive and increasing regulation under us state and foreign insurance laws these laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to us by our operating subsidiaries impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that we can hold prescribe solvency accounting and internal control standards that must be met and maintained and require us to maintain reserves these laws also require disclosure of material interaffiliate transactions and require prior approval of extraordinary transactions such extraordinary transactions include declaring dividends from operating subsidiaries that exceed statutory thresholds these laws also generally require approval of changes of control of insurance companies the application of these laws could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends interest and other payments on securities as applicable and could restrict our ability to expand our business operations through acquisitions of new insurance subsidiaries we may not have or maintain all required licenses and approvals or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us these types of actions could have a material adverse effect on our business to date no material fine penalty or restriction has been imposed on us for failure to comply with any insurance law or regulation   as a result of the recent dislocation of the financial markets congress and the presidential administration in the united states are contemplating changes in the way the financial services industry is regulated it is possible that insurance regulation will be drawn into this process and that federal regulatory initiatives in the insurance industry could emerge in addition regulatory bodies in europe are developing a new capital adequacy directive for insurers and reinsurers the future impact of such initiatives if any on our operation net income loss or financial condition cannot be determined at this time   regulatory challenges in the united states could adversely affect the ability of bermuda re to conduct business   bermuda re does not intend to be licensed or admitted as an insurer or reinsurer in any us jurisdiction under current law bermuda re generally will be permitted to reinsure us risks from its office in bermuda without obtaining those licenses however the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework is subject to periodic legislative review and revision in the past there have been congressional and other initiatives in the united states regarding increased supervision and regulation of the insurance industry including proposals to supervise and regulate reinsurers domiciled outside the united states if bermuda re were to become subject to any insurance laws of the united states or any us state at any time in the future it might be required to post deposits or maintain minimum surplus levels and might be prohibited from engaging in lines of business or from writing some types of policies complying with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business in bermuda and international markets   bermuda re may need to be licensed or admitted in additional jurisdictions to develop its business   as bermuda res business develops it will monitor the need to obtain licenses in jurisdictions other than bermuda and the uk where it has an authorized branch in order to comply with applicable law or to be able to engage in additional insurancerelated activities in addition bermuda re may be at a competitive disadvantage in jurisdictions where it is not licensed or does not enjoy an exemption from licensing relative to competitors that are so licensed or exempt from licensing bermuda re may not be able to obtain any additional licenses that it determines are necessary or desirable furthermore the process of obtaining those licenses is often costly and may take a long time         34      table of contents      bermuda res ability to write reinsurance may be severely limited if it is unable to arrange for security to back its reinsurance   many jurisdictions do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or nonadmitted insurers on their statutory financial statements without appropriate security bermuda res reinsurance clients typically require it to post a letter of credit or enter into other security arrangements if bermuda re is unable to obtain or maintain a letter of credit facility on commercially acceptable terms or is unable to arrange for other types of security its ability to operate its business may be severely limited if bermuda re defaults on any letter of credit that it obtains it may be required to prematurely liquidate a substantial portion of its investment portfolio and other assets pledged as collateral   risks relating to groups securities   because of our holding company structure our ability to pay dividends interest and principal is dependent on our receipt of dividends loan payments and other funds from our subsidiaries   group and holdings are holding companies each of whose most significant asset consists of the stock of its operating subsidiaries as a result each of groups and holdings ability to pay dividends interest or other payments on its securities in the future will depend on the earnings and cash flows of the operating subsidiaries and the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to it this ability is subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors beyond our control payment of dividends and advances and repayments from some of the operating subsidiaries are regulated by us state and foreign insurance laws and regulatory restrictions including minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds accordingly the operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to group and holdings in the future which could prevent us from paying dividends interest or other payments on our securities   provisions in groups byelaws could have an antitakeover effect which could diminish the value of its common shares   groups byelaws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so in addition these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable the effect of these provisions could be to prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future   for example groups byelaws contain the following provisions that could have an antitakeover effect           directors currently serve staggered threeyear terms meaning that the members of only one of

passive institutional investors will be treated similarly to investment companies for this purpose passive institutional investors include all persons who are eligible pursuant to rule 13d1b1 under the us securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act to file a shortform statement on schedule 13g other than an insurance company or any parent holding company or control person of an insurance company   applicable insurance laws may also have an antitakeover effect   before a person can acquire control of a us insurance company prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where that insurance company is domiciled or deemed commercially domiciled prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurance company a state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant the integrity and competence of the applicants board of directors and executive officers the acquirors plans for the future operations of the insurance company and any anticompetitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control because any person who acquired control of group would thereby acquire indirect control of its insurance company subsidiaries in the us the insurance change of control laws of delaware california and georgia would apply to such a transaction this could have the effect of delaying or even preventing such a change of control   the ownership of common shares of group by holdings may have an impact on securing approval of

investors in group may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than investors in a us corporation   the companies act 1981 of bermuda the companies act differs in material respects from the laws applicable to us corporations and their shareholders the following is a summary of material differences between the companies act as modified in some instances by provisions of groups byelaws and delaware corporate law that could make it more difficult for investors in group to protect their interests than investors in a us corporation because the following statements are summaries they do not address all aspects of bermuda law that may be relevant to group and its shareholders   alternate directors groups byelaws provide as permitted by bermuda law that each director may appoint an alternate director who shall have the power to attend and vote at any meeting of the board of directors or committee at which that director is not personally present and to sign written consents in place of that director delaware law does not provide for alternate directors   committees of the board of directors groups byelaws provide as permitted by bermuda law that the board of directors may delegate any of its powers to committees that the board appoints and those committees may consist partly or entirely of nondirectors delaware law allows the board of directors of a corporation to delegate many of its powers to committees but those committees may consist only of directors   interested directors bermuda law and groups byelaws provide that if a director has a personal interest in a transaction to which the company is also a party and if the director discloses the nature of this personal interest at the first opportunity either at a meeting of directors or in writing to the directors then the company will not be able to declare the transaction void solely due to the existence of that personal interest and the director will not be liable to the company for any profit realized from the transaction in addition after a director has made the declaration of interest referred to above he or she is allowed to be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which he or she has an interest unless disqualified from doing so by the chairman of the relevant board meeting under delaware law an interested director could be held liable for a transaction in which that director derived an improper personal benefit additionally under delaware law a corporation may be able to declare a transaction with an interested director to be void unless one of the following conditions is fulfilled           the material facts as to the interested directors relationship or interests are disclosed or are known to the board of directors and the board in good faith authorizes the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors              the material facts are disclosed or are known to the shareholders entitled to vote on the transaction and the transaction is specifically approved in good faith by the holders of a majority of the voting shares or              the transaction is fair to the corporation as of the time it is authorized approved or ratified      transactions with significant shareholders as a bermuda company group may enter into business transactions with its significant shareholders including asset sales in which a significant shareholder receives or could receive a financial benefit that is greater than that received or to be received by other shareholders with prior approval from groups board of directors but without obtaining prior approval from the shareholders in the case of an amalgamation in which two or more companies join together and continue as a single company a resolution of shareholders approved by a majority of at least 75 of the votes cast is required in addition to the approval of the board of directors except in the case of an amalgamation with and between whollyowned subsidiaries if group was a delaware corporation any business combination with an interested shareholder which for this purpose would include mergers and asset sales of greater than 10 of groups assets that would otherwise be considered transactions in the ordinary course of business within a period of three years from the time the person became an interested shareholder would require prior approval from shareholders holding at least 66 23 of groups outstanding common shares not owned by the interested shareholder unless the transaction qualified for one of the exemptions in the relevant delaware statute or group opted out of the statute for purposes of the delaware statute an interested shareholder is generally defined as a person who together with that persons affiliates and associates owns or within the previous three years did own 15 or more of a corporations outstanding voting shares         37      table of contents     takeovers under bermuda law if an acquiror makes an offer for shares of a company and within four months of the offer the holders of not less than 90 of the shares that are the subject of the offer tender their shares the acquiror may give the nontendering shareholders notice requiring them to transfer their shares on the terms of the offer within one month of receiving the notice dissenting shareholders may apply to the court objecting to the transfer the burden is on the dissenting shareholders to show that the court should exercise its discretion to enjoin the transfer the court will be unlikely to do this unless there is evidence of fraud or bad faith or collusion between the acquiror and the tendering shareholders aimed at unfairly forcing out minority shareholders under another provision of bermuda law the holders of 95 of the shares of a company the acquiring shareholders may give notice to the remaining shareholders requiring them to sell their shares on the terms described in the notice within one month of receiving the notice dissenting shareholders may apply to the court for an appraisal of their shares within one month of the courts appraisal the acquiring shareholders are entitled either to acquire all shares involved at the price fixed by the court or cancel the notice given to the remaining shareholders if shares were acquired under the notice at a price below the courts appraisal price the acquiring shareholders must either pay the difference in price or cancel the notice and return the shares thus acquired to the shareholder who must then refund the purchase price there are no comparable provisions under delaware law   inspection of corporate records members of the general public have the right to inspect the public documents

also maintains a branch register in the offices of its transfer agent in the us which is open for public inspection as required under the companies act group is required to keep at its registered office a register of its directors and officers that is open for inspection by members of the public without charge however bermuda law does not provide a general right for shareholders to inspect or obtain copies of any other corporate records under delaware law any shareholder may inspect or obtain copies of a corporations shareholder list and its other books and records for any purpose reasonably related to that persons interest as a shareholder   shareholders suits the rights of shareholders under bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders under legislation or judicial precedent in many us jurisdictions class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda however the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent which would permit a shareholder to bring an action in the name of group to remedy a wrong done to group where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of group or illegal or would result in the violation of groups memorandum of association or byelaws furthermore the court would give consideration to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of groups shareholders than actually approved it the winning party in an action of this type generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action under delaware law class actions and derivative actions generally are available to stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty corporate waste and actions not taken in accordance with applicable law in these types of actions the court has discretion to permit the winning party to recover its attorneys fees   limitation of liability of directors and officers groups byelaws provide that group and its shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have individually or in the right of the company against any director or officer for any act or failure to act in the performance of that directors or officers duties however this waiver does not apply to claims or rights of action that arise out of fraud or dishonesty this waiver may have the effect of barring claims arising under us federal securities laws under delaware law a corporation may include in its certificate of incorporation provisions limiting the personal liability of its directors to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for many types of breach of fiduciary duty however these provisions may not limit liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law the authorization of unlawful dividends stock repurchases or stock redemptions or any transaction from which a director         38      table of contents     derived an improper personal benefit moreover delaware provisions would not be likely to bar claims arising under us federal securities laws   indemnification of directors and officers groups byelaws provide that group shall indemnify its directors or officers to the full extent permitted by law against all actions costs charges liabilities loss damage or expense incurred or suffered by them by reason of any act done concurred in or omitted in the conduct of groups business or in the discharge of their duties under bermuda law this indemnification may not extend to any matter involving fraud or dishonesty of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the company as determined in a final judgment or decree not subject to appeal under delaware law a corporation may indemnify a director or officer who becomes a party to an action suit or proceeding because of his position as a director or officer if 1 the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and 2 if the action or proceeding involves a criminal offense the director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful   enforcement of civil liabilities group is organized under the laws of bermuda some of its directors and officers may reside outside the us a substantial portion of our assets are or may be located in

liability provisions of the us federal securities laws   dividends bermuda law does not allow a company to declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company after the payment is made would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or that the realizable value of the companys assets would be less as a result of the payment than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts the share capital account represents the aggregate par value of issued shares and the share premium account represents the aggregate amount paid for issued shares over and above their par value under delaware law subject to any restrictions contained in a companys certificate of incorporation a company may pay dividends out of the surplus or if there is no surplus out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year surplus is the amount by which the net assets of a corporation exceed its stated capital delaware law also provides that dividends may not be paid out of net profits at any time when stated capital is less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets   risks relating to taxation   if us tax law changes our net income may be reduced   in the last few years some members of congress have expressed concern about us corporations that move their place of incorporation to lowtax jurisdictions also some members of congress have expressed concern over a competitive advantage that foreigncontrolled insurers and reinsurers may have over us controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the purchase of reinsurance by us insurers from affiliates operating in some foreign jurisdictions including bermuda it is possible that future legislation that would be disadvantageous to our bermuda insurance subsidiaries could be enacted if any such legislation were enacted the us tax burden on our bermuda operations or on some business ceded from our licensed us insurance subsidiaries to some offshore reinsurers could be increased this

re is a significant portion of our worldwide income from operations we have established guidelines for the conduct of our operations that are designed to ensure that bermuda re is not engaged in the

source dividend income however if the internal revenue service irs were to successfully assert that bermuda re was engaged in a trade or business bermuda re would be required to pay us corporate income tax on all of its income and possibly the us branch profits tax however if the irs were to successfully assert that bermuda re was engaged in a us trade or business we believe the usbermuda tax

income tax on its income or if we became subject to us income tax our income could also be subject to the us branch profits tax in that event group and bermuda re would be subject to taxation at a higher combined effective rate than if they were organized as us corporations the combined effect of the 35 us corporate income tax rate and the 30 branch profits tax rate is a net tax rate of 545 the

defined for purposes of the consolidated selected financial data as an event that caused a loss on property exposures before reinsurance of at least 100 million before corporate level reinsurance and taxes all prior periods reflect a catastrophe as a property event with expected reported losses of at least 50 million before corporate level reinsurance and taxes catastrophe insurance provides coverage for one event when limits are exhausted some contractual arrangements provide for the availability of additional coverage upon the payment of additional premium this additional premium is referred to as reinstatement premium        2    some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding        3    based on weighted average basic common shares outstanding of 519 million 538 million 566 million 607 million and 617 million for 2012 2011 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively        4    based on weighted average diluted common shares outstanding of 521 million 568 million and 608 million for 2012 2010 and 2009 respectively diluted calculation was not applicable for 2011 and 2008        5    loss ratio is the gaap losses and lae incurred as a percentage of gaap net premiums earned underwriting expense ratio is the gaap commissions brokerage taxes fees and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of gaap net premiums earned combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and

       44        table of contents      item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation   the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto presented under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data   industry conditions the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive as well as cyclical by product and market as such financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of constrained availability high rates and strong profits followed by periods of abundant capacity low rates and constrained profitability competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that we underwrite is based on many factors including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by am best andor standard amp poors underwriting expertise the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized capacity and coverages offered premiums charged other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered services offered speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written furthermore the market impact from these competitive factors related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels   we compete in the us bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations including underwriting syndicates at lloyds some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have established long term and continuing business relationships which can be a significant competitive advantage in addition the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition   worldwide insurance and reinsurance market conditions continued to be very competitive particularly in the casualty lines of business generally there was ample insurance and reinsurance capacity relative to demand competition and its effect on rates terms and conditions vary widely by market and coverage yet continued to be most prevalent in the us casualty insurance and reinsurance markets   however during the fourth quarter of 2012 the industry sustained significant losses from superstorm sandy and also sustained significant losses during 2011 from australian floods the new zealand earthquake the earthquake and tsunami in japan storms in the us and the thailand floods it is too early to determine the longer term impact on market conditions as a result of these events while the 2011 events have resulted in meaningful rate increases for catastrophe coverages in some global catastrophe prone regions particularly areas impacted by these losses whether the magnitude of these 2012 and 2011 losses is sufficient to increase rates and improve market conditions for other lines of business remains to be seen   overall we believe that current marketplace conditions particularly for catastrophe coverages provide profit opportunities for us given our strong ratings distribution system reputation and expertise we continue to employ our strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit potential while maintaining balance and diversification in our overall portfolio             45

written premiums increased by 06 to 43105 million in 2012 compared to 42862 million in 2011 reflecting a 975 million increase in our insurance business partially offset by a 731 million decrease in our reinsurance business the increase in insurance premiums was primarily due to the growth in crop and primary aamph medical stop loss insurance partially offset by the termination and runoff of several large casualty programs the decrease in reinsurance premiums was primarily due to the nonrenewal of a large florida quota share reinsurance contract and a 425 million decline due to movement in foreign exchange rates partially offset by increases in new business and rate increases on renewals particularly for catastrophe exposed contracts eliminating the effects of reinstatement premiums which          46      table of contents     were higher in 2011 due to a higher level of catastrophe losses and foreign currency fluctuations gross written premiums were up 2 year over year net written premiums decreased 07 to 40811 million in 2012 compared to 41089 million in 2011 the variance between the changes in gross and net written premiums was primarily attributable to the growth in the crop business for which the company uses a higher level of reinsurance premiums earned increased by 15 to 41646 million in 2012 compared to 41013 million in 2011 the fluctuations in premiums earned in comparison to net written premiums were primarily attributable to changes in the mix of business particularly crop insurance which has a different premiums earning pattern   gross written premiums increased by 20 to 42862 million in 2011 compared to 42007 million in 2010 reflecting a 1103 million increase in our insurance business partially offset by a 248 million decrease in our reinsurance business the year over year increase in insurance premiums was primarily due to the acquisition of heartland which provided 1696 million of new crop insurance business our recent initiative in primary medical stop loss insurance which added 540 million of premium and improved premium rates on our california workers compensation business partially offset by our reduced participation on a large casualty program the decrease in reinsurance premiums was due to the continued reduction in us casualty business the loss of several large crop reinsurance contracts as well as the planned reduction of catastrophe exposed business in certain territories partially offset by higher reinstatement premiums 358 million resulting from catastrophe losses and favorable foreign exchange impact year over year of 493 million net written premiums increased by 41 to 41089 million in 2011 compared to 39456 million in 2010 the larger increase in net written premiums relative to the change in gross written premiums was due to a lower level of ceded reinsurance in the insurance segment due to the planned reduction in one casualty program premiums earned increased by 42 to 41013 million in 2011 compared to 39346 million in 2010 the change in premiums earned is consistent with the increase in net written premiums   net investment income net investment income decreased by 32 to 6002 million in 2012 compared with net investment income of 6200 million in 2011 net pretax investment income as a percentage of average invested assets was 39 in 2012 compared to 41 in 2011 the decline in income and yield was primarily the result of lower reinvestment rates for the fixed income portfolio partially offset by an increase in our limited partnership income   net investment income decreased by 51 to 6200 million in 2011 compared with net investment income of 6535 million in 2010 primarily as a result of a 139 million decrease in investment income from our limited partnership investments and the effects of lower reinvestment rates in 2011 net pretax investment income as a percentage of average invested assets was 41 in 2011 compared to 45 in 2010 the variance in this yield was primarily the result of fluctuations in our limited partnership income   net realized capital gains losses net realized capital gains were 1644 million 69 million and 1019 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the 1644 million was comprised of 1181 million of gains from fair value remeasurements and 563 million of net realized capital gains from sales on our fixed maturity and equity securities which were partially offset by 100 million of otherthantemporary impairments the net realized capital gains of 69 million in 2011 were the result of 275 million of net realized capital gains from sales on our fixed maturity and equity securities which was partially offset by 44 million of losses from fair value remeasurements and 162 million of otherthantemporary impairments the net realized capital gains of 1019 million in 2010 were the result of 704 million of gains in fair value remeasurements and 345 million of net realized capital gains from sales on our fixed maturity and equity securities which were partially offset by 30 million of otherthantemporary impairments   net derivative gain loss in 2005 and prior we sold seven equity index put option contracts which remain outstanding these contracts meet the definition of a derivative in accordance with fasb guidance and as such are fair valued each quarter with the change recorded as net derivative gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss as a result of these adjustments in value we recognized net derivative losses of 97 million 113 million and 11 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the change in the fair value of these equity index put option contracts is indicative of the change in the equity markets and interest rates over the same

of unallocated ibnr reserves at december 31 2012 current year attritional losses decreased 832 million representing 29 loss ratio points due to a shift in mix of business towards excess of loss business which generally has lower attritional losses             48      table of contents      incurred losses and lae increased by 265 to 37262 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 29457 million in 2010 of the 7805 million increase current year catastrophe losses represented 7139 million or 168 points period over period primarily due to the 2011 catastrophe losses discussed above the 5865 million of current year catastrophe losses for 2010 related primarily to the chile earthquake 4162 million the 2010 new zealand earthquake 900 million the 2010 australia hailstorms and floods 653 million and the canadian hailstorm 150 million in addition the overall attritional losses increased 503 million due in part to higher earned premium in the current year which generated higher attritional losses for the current year as well as the impact of favorable development in 2010 without comparable favorable development in 2011   commission brokerage taxes and fees commission brokerage taxes and fees increased by 02 to 9527 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 9505 million in 2011 the increase is due primarily to the onetime effect of the nonrenewal of a florida quota share contract and the adoption of new accounting standards concerning the accounting for acquisition costs which increased expenses in 2012 the increased expenses resulting from these two factors were partially offset by an increase in excess of loss business which carries a lower commission than pro rata business   commission brokerage taxes and fees increased by 20 to 9505 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 9319 million in 2010 due primarily to the increase in premiums earned conversely commissions as a percentage of earned premiums are down for the year driven by a shift in distribution channels on the insurance book with a greater proportion of the business being accessed directly at lower commission rates rather than through managing general agents in addition there was also an impact from a shift in the mix of business due to a higher level of excess loss business in the current year which carries a lower commission than pro rata business   other underwriting expenses other underwriting expenses were 2077 million 1824 million and 1663 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase in other underwriting expenses for 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly due to higher sharebased compensation and employee benefit plan expenses the increase in other underwriting expenses for 2011 compared to 2010 was mainly due to expenses of heartland which was acquired in january 2011   corporate expenses corporate expenses which are general operating expenses that are not allocated to segments were 240 million 165 million and 149 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the increases in corporate expenses were mainly due to higher sharebased compensation expense   interest fees and bond issue cost amortization expense interest fees and other bond amortization expense was 537 million and 523 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase was primarily due to additional costs for the new group credit facility signed in june 2012   interest fees and other bond amortization expense was 523 million and 558 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease was primarily due to the maturing of debt in march 2010   income tax expense benefit we had an income tax expense of 1106 million in 2012 and income tax benefits of 1535 million and 195 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively our income tax is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates and corresponding pretax income in the jurisdictions where we operate coupled with the impact from taxpreferenced investment income variations in our effective tax rate generally result from changes in the relative levels of pretax income among jurisdictions with different tax rates the increase in tax expense was mainly due to the improvement in taxable income resulting from lower catastrophe losses in 2012 the 2012 income tax expense also reflects tax benefits of 175 million realized due to corrections of understatements in the deferred tax asset account and 319 million of tax benefits from a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions due to the remeasurement of our exposure following the closing of an irs audit the tax benefit in 2010 resulted primarily from a tax audit settlement             49      table of contents      net income loss our net income was 8290 million in 2012 and our net loss was 805 in 2011 the increase was primarily driven by the decline in catastrophe losses in 2012   our net loss was 805 million and our net income was 6108 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease was primarily driven by an increase in catastrophe losses in 2011   ratios our combined ratio decreased by 247 points to 938 in 2012 compared to 1185 in 2011 the loss ratio component decreased 250 points in 2012 over the same period last year primarily due to the decline in catastrophe losses in 2012 compared to 2011 the commission and brokerage ratio component slightly decreased over the same period last year due to an increase in excess of loss business which carries a lower commission than pro rata business partially offset by the onetime effect of the nonrenewal of the florida quota share and the adoption of new accounting standards concerning the accounting for acquisition costs eliminating the impact of reinstatement premiums contingent commissions and these one time items the commission and brokerage ratio improved 15 points to 212 driven by the shift in the mix of business the other underwriting expense ratio component increased slightly from the same period last year due to higher employee benefit costs   our combined ratio increased by 157 points to 1185 in 2011 compared to 1028 in 2010 the loss ratio component increased 160 points in 2011 over the same period last year principally due to higher current year catastrophe losses as a result of the japan earthquake new zealand earthquake thailand floods us storms the australia floods and hurricane irene the other underwriting expense ratio component increased slightly and the commission and brokerage ratio component decreased slightly over the same period last year due to the mix of business   shareholders equity shareholders equity increased by 6621 million to 67335 million at december 31 2012 from 60714 million at december 31 2011 principally as a result of 8290 million of net

million in 2012 compared to 6200 million in 2011 primarily due to declines in income from our fixed maturities reflective of declining reinvestment rates partially offset by an increase in income from our limited partnership investments   net investment income decreased by 51 to 6200 million in 2011 compared to 6535 million in 2010 primarily due to a decrease in income from our limited partnership investments and a decline in income from our fixed maturities reflective of reducing our municipal bond exposures and declining reinvestment rates these decreases were partially offset by increased

equivalent return adjusts the yield on taxexempt bonds to the fully taxable equivalent   as indicated above there is a relatively large variation between the total return on our fixed income portfolio for the year ended december 31 2011 versus the barclays  us aggregate index for the same period one of the reasons is that the duration of our portfolio is much shorter than the duration of the index historically our duration has been shorter than the index because we align our investment portfolio with our liabilities in addition we shortened our duration in anticipation of a reversing trend in interest rate movements with interest rates continuing to decline in 2011 the index benefited from its longer duration however in the longer term there will be a benefit from a reduced exposure to unrealized market valuation losses on our fixed income portfolio if interest rates rise our total return was more comparable to the index in 2012 as interest rates remained fairly steady the composition of the index is also different from our portfolio as we hold foreign securities to match our foreign liabilities while the index is comprised of only us securities             51

aamph primary business which is a relatively new line of business for the company has increased significantly representing approximately 2 of premiums earned and is projected to continue to grow the aamph primary business is better aligned with the insurance reporting segment based on the similarities of this business with those businesses already reflected in the insurance segment the other operating units included in the specialty underwriting segment would have encompassed less than 5 of the companys premiums earned and their volume is projected to remain less than 5 as a result of the size of these remaining operating units and their similarity to the business reported within us reinsurance they have been reclassified to the us reinsurance segment there has been no change to the international and bermuda reporting segments the company has restated all segment information for prior years to conform to the new reporting segment structure   the us reinsurance operation writes property and casualty reinsurance and specialty lines of business including marine aviation surety and aamph business on both a treaty and facultative basis through reinsurance brokers as well as

measure our underwriting results using ratios in particular loss commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios which respectively divide incurred losses commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by premiums earned we utilize interaffiliate reinsurance although such reinsurance does not materially impact segment results as business is generally reported within the segment in which the business was first produced   our loss and lae reserves are our best estimate of our ultimate liability for unpaid claims we reevaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including

changes in the mix of business   gross written premiums decreased by 35 to 13468 million in 2011 from 13954 million in 2010 primarily due to reduced reinsurance premiums for aamph crop and marine

to a decrease of 95 million 43 points in attritional losses resulting primarily from lower prior years losses in 2012 resulting from development on excess casualty and california workers compensation

superstorm sandy 55 million   incurred losses and lae increased by 1692 million or 315 to 7059 million in 2011 compared to 5368 million in 2010 this was primarily due to an increase of 1414 million in

policies   the following is a summary of the critical accounting policies related to accounting estimates that 1 require management to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters and 2 could materially impact the consolidated financial statements if management made different assumptions   loss and lae reserves our most critical accounting policy is the determination of our loss and lae reserves we maintain reserves equal to our estimated ultimate liability for losses and lae for reported and unreported claims for our insurance and reinsurance businesses because reserves are based on estimates of ultimate losses and lae by underwriting or accident year we use a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to monitor reserve adequacy over time evaluate new information as it becomes known and adjust reserves whenever an adjustment appears warranted we consider many factors when setting reserves including 1 our exposure base and projected ultimate premiums earned 2 our expected loss ratios by product and class of business which are developed collaboratively by underwriters and actuaries 3 actuarial methodologies which analyze our loss reporting and payment experience reports from ceding companies and historical trends such as reserving patterns loss payments and product mix 4 current legal interpretations of coverage and liability 5 economic conditions and 6 uncertainties discussed below regarding our liability for aampe claims our insurance and reinsurance loss and lae reserves represent our best estimate of our ultimate liability actual losses and lae ultimately paid may deviate perhaps substantially from such reserves our net income loss will be impacted in a period in which the change in estimated ultimate losses and lae is recorded see also item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements   it is more difficult to accurately estimate loss reserves for reinsurance liabilities than for insurance liabilities at december 31 2012 we had reinsurance reserves of 76338 million and insurance loss reserves of 24353 million of which 3563 million and 865 million respectively were loss reserves for aampe liabilities a detailed discussion of additional considerations related to aampe exposures follows later in this section   the detailed data required to evaluate ultimate losses for our insurance business is accumulated from our underwriting and claim systems reserving for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from ceding companies ceding companies report losses to us in many forms dependent on the type of contract and the agreed or contractual reporting requirements generally proportionalquota share contracts require the submission of a monthlyquarterly account which includes premium and loss activity for the period with corresponding reserves as established by the ceding company this information is recorded into our records for certain proportional contracts we may require a detailed loss report for claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold or relate to a particular type of loss excess of loss and facultative contracts generally require individual loss reporting with precautionary notices provided when a loss reaches a significant percentage of the attachment point of the contract or when certain causes of loss or types of injury occur our experienced claims staff handles individual loss reports and supporting claim information based on our evaluation of a claim we may establish additional case reserves acrs in addition to the case reserves reported by the ceding company to ensure ceding companies are submitting required and accurate data the underwriting claim reinsurance accounting and internal audit departments of the company perform various reviews of our ceding companies particularly larger ceding companies including onsite audits   we sort both our reinsurance and insurance reserves into exposure groupings for actuarial analysis we assign our business to exposure groupings so that the underlying exposures have reasonably homogeneous loss development characteristics and are large enough to facilitate credible estimation of ultimate losses we periodically review our exposure groupings and we may change our groupings over time as our business changes we currently use over 200 exposure groupings to develop our reserve estimates one of the key selection characteristics for the exposure groupings is the historical duration of the claims settlement process business in which claims are reported and settled relatively quickly are commonly referred to as short tail lines principally property lines on the other hand casualty claims tend to take longer to be reported and settled and casualty lines are generally referred to as long tail lines our estimates of ultimate losses for shorter tail lines with the exception of loss estimates for large catastrophic events generally exhibit less volatility than those for the longer tail lines           62      table of contents     we use similar actuarial methodologies such as expected loss ratio chain ladder reserving methods and borhuetter ferguson supplemented by judgment where appropriate to estimate our ultimate losses and lae for each exposure group although we use similar actuarial methodologies for both short tail and long tail lines the faster reporting of experience for the short tail lines allows us to have greater confidence in our estimates of ultimate losses for short tail lines at an earlier stage than for long tail lines as a result we utilize as well exposurebased methods to estimate our ultimate losses for longer tail lines especially for immature accident years for both short and long tail lines we supplement these general approaches with analytically based judgments we cannot estimate losses from widespread catastrophic events such as hurricanes and earthquakes using traditional actuarial methods we estimate losses for these types of events based on information derived from catastrophe models quantitative and qualitative exposure analyses reports and communications from ceding companies and development patterns for historically similar events due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating such losses these estimates are subject to variability which increases with the severity and complexity of the underlying event   our key actuarial assumptions contain no explicit provisions for reserve uncertainty nor do we supplement the actuarially determined reserves for uncertainty   our carried reserves at each reporting date are our best estimate of ultimate unpaid losses and lae at that date we complete detailed reserve studies for each exposure group annually for our reinsurance and insurance operations the completed annual reinsurance reserve studies are rolled forward for each accounting period until the subsequent reserve study is completed analyzing the rollforward process involves comparing actual reported losses to expected losses based on the most recent reserve study we analyze significant variances between actual and expected losses and post adjustments to our reserves as warranted   given the inherent variability in our loss reserves we have developed an estimated range of possible gross reserve levels a table of ranges by segment accompanied by commentary on potential and historical variability is included in financial condition  loss and lae reserves the ranges are statistically developed using the exposure groups used in the reserve estimation process and aggregated to the segment level for each exposure group our actuaries calculate a range for each accident year based principally on two variables the first is the historical changes in losses and lae incurred but not reported ibnr for each accident year over time the second is volatility of each accident years held reserves related to estimated ultimate losses also over time both are measured at various ages from the end of the accident year through the final payout of the years losses ranges are developed for the exposure groups using statistical methods to adjust for diversification the ranges for the exposure groups are aggregated to the segment level likewise with an adjustment for diversification our estimates of our reserve variability may not be comparable to those of other companies because there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations our recorded reserves reflect our best point estimate of our liabilities and our actuarial methodologies focus on developing such point estimates we calculate the ranges subsequently based on the historical variability of such reserves   asbestos and environmental exposures we continue to receive claims under expired insurance and reinsurance contracts asserting injuries andor damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances including asbestos environmental claims typically assert liability for a the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or b bodily injury or property damage caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land air or water asbestos claims typically assert liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos   our reserves include an estimate of our ultimate liability for aampe claims our aampe liabilities emanate from mt mckinleys direct insurance business and everest res assumed reinsurance business there are significant uncertainties surrounding our estimates of our potential losses from aampe claims among the uncertainties are a potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage b difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or environmental contamination c difficulty in properly allocating responsibility andor liability for asbestos or environmental damage d changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws e the potential for an asbestos or environmental claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods f questions concerning          63      table of contents     interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage and g uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental exposure   with respect to asbestos claims in particular several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound the difficulty in estimating our liability these developments include a a changing mix of claim types represented in new filings with the relative percentage of claims by individuals with no functional impairment first increasing then decreasing over the past several years b the growth in the number of claims where coverage is sought under the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the product liability portion c an increase in settlement values being paid to asbestos claimants especially those with cancer or functional impairment d the slow development of asbestos bankruptcy cases as a result of which many of the critical legal issues arising in those cases are still unresolved at the appellate level e measures adopted by specific courts to ameliorate the worst procedural abuses f legislation in some states to address asbestos litigation issues and g the potential that other states may adopt legislation on asbestos litigation anecdotal evidence suggests that new claims filing rates have decreased that new filings of asbestosdriven bankruptcies have decreased and that various procedural and legislative reforms are beginning to diminish the potential ultimate liability for asbestos losses however some studies indicate that thus far aggregate payments for asbestos claims have not decreased   we believe that these uncertainties continue to render reserves for aampe and particularly asbestos losses significantly less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than reserves for other types of losses we establish reserves to the extent that in the judgment of management the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for us or our ceding companies   we have direct relationships with mt mckinley policyholders and we attempt to uphold our contractual rights and assert valid defenses to coverage where appropriate the uncertainties inherent in asbestos coverage and bankruptcy litigations have provided us the opportunity to engage in settlement negotiations with a number of policyholders who have potentially significant asbestos liabilities those discussions are aimed at achieving reasonable negotiated settlements that limit mt mckinleys liability to a given policyholder to a sum certain because of the risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation we cannot be certain that this approach will lead to a negotiated settlement in the range expected by us in each or every instance between 2004 and 2012 we concluded settlements or reached agreement in principle with 23 of our high profile policyholders we continue the approach of attempting to negotiate with such policyholders that may have significant asbestos liabilities in part because their exposures have developed to the point where we and the policyholder have sufficient information to be motivated to settle we believe that this active approach will ultimately result in a more costeffective liquidation of mt mckinleys liabilities than a passive approach although it may also introduce additional variability in mt mckinleys losses and cash flows as reserves are adjusted to reflect the developments in litigation negotiations and ultimately potential settlements   there is little potential for similar settlements of our reinsurance asbestos claims where we have no direct relationships with the insureds our ceding companies have the direct obligation to insureds and are responsible for their own claim settlements they are not consistently prompt in developing and providing claim settlement information to their reinsurers which can introduce inconsistencies and significant delays in the reporting of asbestos claimsexposures to reinsurers including us these delays not only extend the timing of reinsurance claim settlements but also limit the available information from which reinsurers including us estimate their ultimate exposure see the discussion below under the heading financial condition  loss and lae reserves   due to the uncertainties discussed above the ultimate losses attributable to aampe and particularly asbestos may be subject to more variability than are nonaampe reserves and such variation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations andor cash flows see also item 8 financial statements

exposure to adverse claim experience large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences our ceded reinsurance provides for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances such reinsurance does not relieve us of our obligation to our policyholders in the event our reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations under these agreements or are able to successfully challenge losses ceded by us under the contracts we will not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance receivable balance to minimize exposure from uncollectible reinsurance receivables we have a reinsurance security committee that evaluates the financial strength of each reinsurer prior to our entering into a reinsurance arrangement in some cases we may hold full or partial collateral for the receivable including letters of credit trust assets and cash additionally creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business written in the us are generally required to secure their obligations we have established reserves for uncollectible balances based on our assessment of the collectability of the outstanding balances as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the reserve for

contract such reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data received from ceding companies premiums earned and the related costs which have not yet been reported to us are estimated and accrued because of the inherent lag in the reporting of written and earned premiums by our ceding companies we use standard accepted actuarial methodologies to

the total return on our fixed income portfolio for the year ended december 31 2011 versus the barclays  us aggregate index for the same period one of the reasons is that the duration of our portfolio is much shorter than the duration of the index historically our duration has been shorter than the index because we align our investment portfolio with our liabilities in addition we shortened our duration in anticipation of a reversing trend in interest rate movements with interest rates continuing to decline in 2011 the index benefited from its longer duration however in the longer term there will be a benefit from a reduced exposure to unrealized market valuation losses on our fixed income portfolio if interest rates rise our total return was more comparable to the index in 2012 as interest rates remained fairly steady the composition of the index is also different from our portfolio as we hold foreign securities to match our foreign liabilities while the index is comprised of

existing reserves and reserving methodologies lessen the probability that any such increase would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in this context we note that over the past 10 years our calendar year operations have been affected by effects from prior period reserve reestimates ranging from a favorable 309 million in 2010 representing 04 of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made to an unfavorable 2494 million in 2004 representing 48 of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made   we have included ranges for loss reserve estimates determined by our actuaries which have been developed through a combination of objective and subjective criteria our presentation of this information may not be directly comparable to similar presentations of other companies as there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations our recorded reserves are an aggregation of our best point estimates for approximately 200 reserve groups and reflect our best point estimate of our liabilities our actuarial methodologies develop point estimates rather than ranges and the ranges are developed subsequently based upon historical and prospective variability measures   the following table below represents the

totals are displayed for both the low and high range amounts it should be noted that statistically the range of the total is not equal to the sum of the ranges of the segments      depending on the specific segment the range derived for the loss reserves excluding reserves for aampe exposures ranges from minus 93 to minus 179 for the low range and from plus 93 to plus 179 for the high range both the higher and lower ranges are associated with the insurance segment the size of the range is dependent upon the level of confidence associated with the outcome within each range our best estimate of loss reserves is based upon the point estimate derived by our actuaries in detailed reserve studies such ranges are necessarily subjective due to the lack of generally accepted actuarial standards with respect to their development for the above presentation we have assumed what we believe is a reasonable confidence level but note that there can be no assurance that our claim obligations will not vary outside of these ranges   additional losses including those relating to latent injuries and other exposures which are as yet unrecognized the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by us or the reinsurance and insurance industry generally may emerge in the future such future emergence to the extent not covered by existing retrocessional contracts could have material adverse effects on our future financial condition results of operations and cash flows             69      table of contents      we have exposure to insured aampe losses through our mt mckinley operation and reinsured aampe losses and through everest re in each case our management and analyses of our exposures take into account a number of features of our business that differentiate our exposures from many other insurers and reinsurers that have significant aampe exposures   mt mckinley began writing small amounts of aampe exposed insurance in 1975 and increased the volume of its writings in 1978 these writings ceased in 1984 giving mt mckinley an approximate 10year window of potential aampe exposure which is appreciably shorter than is the case for many companies with significant aampe exposure additionally due to changes in and standardization of policy forms it is rare for policies in the 1970s and 1980s to have been issued without aggregate limits on the product liability coverage policies issued in earlier decades were generally more likely to lack aggregate limits   the vast majority of mt mckinleys aampe exposed insurance policies are excess casualty policies with aggregate coverage limits mt mckinleys attachment points vary but generally are excess of millions often tens of millions of dollars of underlying coverage the excess nature of most of mt mckinleys policies also offers insulation against nonproduct claims for example claims arising under general liability coverage although under some circumstances an excess policy could be exposed to nonproduct claims such claims generally pose more of a risk to primary policies because nonproduct claims are generally less likely to aggregate since each nonproduct claim is a separate loss whereas for product claims all claims related to a given product aggregate as one loss environmental claims arise under general liability coverage and generally do not aggregate thus these claims tend to create exposure for primary policies to a greater extent than excess policies   everest re was formed in 1973 but was not fully engaged in underwriting casualty business under which aampe exposures generally arise until 1974 and it effectively eliminated aampe exposures beginning in 1984 through contract exclusions therefore everest re has an approximate 11year window of aampe exposure much shorter than that of many long established reinsurance companies in the earlier years of its existence everest re mainly wrote property business which generally is not exposed to asbestos claims everest re reinsured both primary and excess policies however its claim experience indicates that the majority of its exposure was on excess policies similar to those directly written by mt mckinley   asbestos and environmental exposures aampe exposures represent a separate exposure group for monitoring and evaluating reserve adequacy the following table summarizes incurred losses and outstanding loss reserves

liabilities cannot be accomplished using standard actuarial techniques we believe that our aampe reserves represent our best estimate of the ultimate liability however there can be no assurance that ultimate loss payments will not exceed such reserves perhaps by a significant amount         71      table of contents     industry analysts use the survival ratio to compare the aampe reserves among companies with such liabilities the survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a companys current net reserves by the three year average of annual paid losses hence the survival ratio equals the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves if future loss payments were to continue at historical levels using this measurement our net three year asbestos survival ratio was 71 years at december 31 2012 these metrics can be skewed by individual large settlements occurring in the prior three years and therefore may not be indicative of the timing of future payments   because the survival ratio was developed as a comparative measure of reserve strength and does not indicate absolute reserve adequacy we consider but do not rely on the survival ratio when evaluating our reserves in particular we note that year to year loss payment variability can be material this is due in part to our orientation to negotiated settlements particularly on our mt mckinley exposures which significantly reduces the credibility and utility of this measure as an analytical tool in 2012 we made asbestos net claim payments of 24 million to mt mckinley high profile claimants where the claim was either closed or a settlement had been reached such payments which are nonrepetitive distort downward our three year survival ratio adjusting for such settlements recognizing that total settlements are generally considered fully reserved to an agreed settlement we consider that our adjusted asbestos survival ratio for net unsettled claims is 81 years which is better than prevailing industry norms   shareholders equity our shareholders equity increased to 67335 million as of december 31 2012 from 60714 million as of december 31 2011 this increase was the result of 8290 million of

continue to possess significant financial flexibility and access to the debt and equity markets as a result of our perceived financial strength as evidenced by the financial strength ratings as assigned by independent rating agencies   from time to time we have used open market share repurchases to adjust our capital position and enhance long term expected returns to our shareholders on july

trust iii to register trust preferred securities   liquidity our principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet our insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize aftertax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio considering these objectives we view our investment portfolio as having two components 1 the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities our core fixed maturities portfolio and 2 investments funded by our shareholders equity   for the portion needed to satisfy global outstanding liabilities we generally invest in taxable and taxpreferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of aa3 for the us portion of this portfolio our mix of taxable and taxpreferenced investments is adjusted periodically consistent with our current and projected us operating results market conditions and our tax position this global fixed maturity securities portfolio is externally managed by an independent professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by internal management   over the past several years we have expanded the allocation of our investments funded by shareholders equity to include 1 a greater percentage of publicly traded equity securities 2 emerging market fixed maturities through mutual fund structures as well as individual holdings 3 high yield fixed maturities 4 bank loan securities and 5 private equity limited partnership investments the objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the riskadjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes which are also less subject to changes in value with movements in interest rates we limit our allocation to these asset classes because of 1 the potential for volatility in their values and 2 the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models we use investment managers experienced in these markets and adjust our allocation to these investments based upon market conditions at december 31 2012 the market value of investments in these investment market sectors carried at both market and fair value approximated 63 of shareholders equity   our liquidity requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations positive cash flow results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for claims which disbursements generally take place over an extended period after the collection of premiums sometimes a period of many years collected premiums are generally invested prior to their use in such disbursements and investment income provides additional funding for loss payments our net cash flows from operating activities were 6639 million 6595 million and 9185 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively additionally these cash flows reflected a net tax payment of 598 million and net tax refunds of 445 million and 310 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively net catastrophe loss payments of 5513 million 5592 million and 4108 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively and net aampe payments of 546 million 535 million and 802 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively   if disbursements for claims and benefits policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses were to exceed premium inflows cash flow from reinsurance and insurance operations would be negative the effect on cash flow from insurance operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income additionally cash inflows from investment maturities and dispositions both shortterm investments and longer term maturities are available to supplement other operating cash flows   as the timing of payments for claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty we maintain portfolios of long term invested assets with varying maturities along with shortterm investments that provide additional liquidity for payment of claims at december 31 2012 and 2011 we held cash and shortterm investments of 13974 million and 11340 million respectively all of our shortterm investments are readily marketable and can be converted to cash in addition to these cash and shortterm investments at december 31 2012 we had 9578 million of available for sale fixed maturity securities maturing within one year or less 57413 million maturing within one to five years and 37858 million maturing after five years our 13991 million of equity securities are comprised primarily of publicly traded securities that can          73      table of contents     be easily liquidated we believe that these fixed maturity and equity securities in conjunction with the shortterm investments and positive cash flow from operations provide ample sources of liquidity for the expected payment of losses in the near future we do not anticipate selling securities or using available credit facilities to pay losses and lae but have the ability to do so sales of securities might result in realized capital gains or losses at december 31 2012 we had 7086 million of net pretax unrealized appreciation comprised of 7407 million of pretax unrealized appreciation and 321 million of pretax unrealized depreciation   management expects annual positive cash flow from operations which in general reflects the strength of overall pricing to persist over the near term absent any unusual catastrophe activity due to the significant catastrophe losses in 2011 cash flow from operations may be impacted in the near term as these losses continue to be paid in the intermediate and long term our cash flow from operations will be impacted to the extent by which competitive pressures affect overall pricing in our markets and by which our premium receipts are impacted from our strategy of

reinsurance companies we are exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence whether a natural event such as a hurricane or an earthquake or other catastrophe such as an explosion at a major factory a large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties facultative certificates and across lines of business   we focus on potential losses that could result from any single event or series of events as part of our evaluation and monitoring of our aggregate exposures to catastrophic events accordingly we employ various techniques to estimate the amount of loss we could sustain from any single catastrophic event or series of events in various geographic areas these techniques range from deterministic approaches such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastropheprone zones and applying reasonable damage factors to modeled approaches that attempt to scientifically measure catastrophe loss exposure using sophisticated monte carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis   no single universal model or group of models is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which we conduct business in addition the form quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for our licensed models which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections further the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business units also while most models have been updated to incorporate claim information from recent catastrophic events catastrophe model projections are still inherently imprecise in addition uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles add to the already significant uncertainty of loss projections from models using historic long term frequency and severity data   nevertheless when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events   projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the pml we define pml as our anticipated loss taking into account contract terms and limits caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake the pml will vary depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the makeup of the in force book of business the projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods such as 100year events and 250year events for example a 100year pml is the estimated loss to the current inforce portfolio from a single event which has a 1 probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period in other words it corresponds to a 99 probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated pml it is important to note that pmls are estimates modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model as a result there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event pml             75      table of contents      from an enterprise risk management perspective management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure we may underwrite the limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors including but not limited to our financial resources and expected earnings and riskreward analyses of the business being underwritten   management estimates that the projected net economic loss from its largest 100year event in a given zone represents approximately 10 of its projected 2013 shareholders equity economic loss is the gross pml reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and estimated income taxes the impact of income taxes on the pml depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity which is also affected by interaffiliate reinsurance management also monitors and controls its largest pmls at multiple points along the loss distribution curve such as loss amounts at the 20 50 100 250 500 and 1000 year return periods this process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk underwriting and capital management decisions   our catastrophe loss projections segmented by risk zones are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process   we believe that our greatest worldwide 1 in 100 year exposure to a single catastrophic event is to a hurricane affecting the us southeast coast where we estimate we have a gross pml exposure of 1084 million see also table under item 1 business  risk management of underwriting and retrocession arrangements   if such a single catastrophe loss were to occur management estimates that the economic loss to us would be approximately 671 million the estimate involves multiple variables including which everest entity would experience the loss and as a result there can be no assurance that this amount would not be exceeded   we may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of our operations reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing terms conditions and availability of coverage with the aim of securing cost effective protection the amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time reflecting our view of our exposures and the cost of reinsurance   for the period from august 1 2012 to july 31 2013 we have catastrophe loss reinsurance

risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period   interest rate risk our 166 billion investment portfolio at december 31 2012 is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities which are generally subject to interest rate risk and some foreign currency exchange rate risk and some equity securities which are subject to price fluctuations and some foreign exchange rate risk the overall economic impact of the foreign exchange risks on the investment portfolio is partially mitigated by changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated liabilities and their associated income statement impact   interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity securities portfolio including shortterm investments from a change in market interest rates in a declining interest rate environment it includes prepayment risk on the 24803 million of mortgagebacked securities in the 131831 million fixed maturity portfolio prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the security   the table below displays the potential impact of

parallel and immediate 100 and 200 basis point shifts in interest rates for legal entities with a us dollar functional currency this modeling was performed on each security individually to generate appropriate price estimates on mortgagebacked securities changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments were taken into account for legal entities with a nonus dollar

million of gross reserves for losses and lae as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively these amounts are recorded at their nominal value as opposed to present value which would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the time value of money since losses are paid out over a period of time the present value of the reserves is less than the nominal value as interest rates rise the present value of the reserves decreases and conversely as interest rates decline the present value increases these movements are the opposite of the interest rate impacts on the fair value of investments while the difference between present value and nominal value is not reflected in our financial statements our financial results will include investment income over time from the investment portfolio until the

exercise dates which fall between june 2017 and march 2031 if the sampp 500 index is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date the amount due would vary proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price based on historical index volatilities and trends and the december 31 2012 sampp 500 index value we estimate the probability that each equity index put option contract of the sampp 500 index falling below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 44 the theoretical maximum payouts under these six equity index put option contracts would occur if on each of the exercise dates the sampp 500 index value were zero at december 31 2012 the present value of these theoretical maximum payouts using a 3 discount factor was 3959

with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price based on historical index volatilities and trends and the december 31 2012 ftse 100 index value we estimate the probability that the equity index put option contract of the ftse 100 index will fall below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 47 the theoretical maximum payout under the equity index put option contract would occur if on the exercise date the ftse 100 index value was zero at december 31 2012 the present value of the theoretical maximum payout using a 3 discount factor and current exchange rate was 425 million conversely if the contract had expired on december 31 2012 with the ftse index at 589780 the settlement amount would have been 08 million   because the equity index put option contracts meet the definition of a derivative we report the fair value of these instruments in our consolidated balance sheets as a liability and record any changes to fair value in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss as a net derivative gain loss our financial statements reflect fair values for our obligations on these equity index put option contracts at december 31 2012 of 795 million even though it may not be likely that the ultimate settlement of these transactions would require a payment that would exceed the initial consideration received or any payment at all   as there is no active market for these instruments the determination of their fair value is based on an industry accepted option pricing model which requires estimates and assumptions including those regarding volatility and expected rates of return             81      table of contents      the tables below display the impact of potential movements in interest rates and the equity
