reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurance or reinsurance company the ceding company against all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more insurance contracts reinsurance can provide a ceding company with several benefits including a reduction in its net liability on individual risks or classes of risks catastrophe protection from large andor multiple losses andor a reduction in operating leverage as measured by the ratio of net premiums and reserves to capital reinsurance also provides a ceding company with additional underwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write more business than would be acceptable relative to the ceding companys financial resources reinsurance does not discharge the ceding company from its liability to policyholders rather it reimburses the ceding company for covered losses   there are two basic types of reinsurance arrangements treaty and facultative treaty reinsurance obligates the ceding company to cede and the reinsurer to assume a specified portion of a type or category of risks insured by the ceding company treaty reinsurers do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under their treaties instead the reinsurer relies upon the pricing and underwriting decisions made by the ceding company in facultative reinsurance the ceding company cedes and the reinsurer assumes all or part of the risk under a single insurance contract facultative reinsurance is negotiated separately for each insurance contract that is reinsured facultative reinsurance when purchased by ceding companies usually is intended to cover individual risks not covered by their reinsurance treaties because of the dollar limits involved or because the risk is unusual   both treaty and facultative reinsurance can be written on either a pro rata basis or an excess of loss basis under pro rata reinsurance the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion under excess of loss reinsurance the reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses and expenses in excess of a specified dollar amount known as the ceding companys retention or reinsurers attachment point generally subject to a negotiated reinsurance contract limit   in pro rata reinsurance the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission the ceding commission generally is based on the ceding companys cost of acquiring the business being reinsured commissions premium taxes assessments and miscellaneous administrative expense and may contain profit sharing provisions whereby the ceding commission is adjusted based on loss experience premiums paid by the ceding company to a reinsurer for excess of loss reinsurance are not directly proportional to the premiums that the ceding company receives because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk there is usually no ceding commission on excess of loss reinsurance   reinsurers may purchase reinsurance to cover their own risk exposure reinsurance of a reinsurers business is called a retrocession reinsurance companies cede risks under retrocessional agreements to other reinsurers known as retrocessionaires for reasons similar to those that cause insurers to purchase reinsurance to reduce net liability on individual or classes of risks protect against catastrophic losses stabilize financial ratios and obtain additional underwriting capacity   reinsurance can be written through intermediaries generally professional reinsurance brokers or directly with ceding companies from a ceding companys perspective the broker and the direct distribution channels have advantages and disadvantages a ceding companys decision to select one distribution channel over the other will be influenced by its perception of such advantages and disadvantages relative to the reinsurance coverage being placed   business strategy the companys business strategy is to sustain its leadership position within targeted reinsurance and insurance markets provide effective

strategies is to lead as many of the reinsurance treaties it underwrites as possible the company leads on approximately twothirds of its treaty reinsurance business as measured by premium the lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in the strongest position to negotiate price terms and conditions management believes this strategy enables it to obtain more favorable terms and conditions on the treaties on which it participates when the company does not lead the treaty it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty the company may decline to participate on a treaty based upon its assessment of all relevant factors   the companys treaty underwriting process involves a team approach among the companys underwriters actuaries and claim staff treaties are reviewed for compliance with the companys general underwriting standards and most larger treaties are subjected to detailed actuarial analysis the actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the subject exposures and loss experience the company does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties the company does however evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty the company may also conduct underwriting operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding companies to monitor adherence to underwriting guidelines underwriting audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff pricing and risk selection and rate monitoring over time claim audits may be performed in order to evaluate the clients claims handling abilities and practices   the companys facultative underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks limits and maximum risk exposures specified classes of large premium us risks are referred to everest res new york facultative headquarters for specific review before premium quotations are given to clients in addition the companys guidelines require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate limits complexity or volatility regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract nonus risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within the involved operations   the companys insurance operations principally write casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through select program managers these programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and the program managers capabilities the companys rates forms and underwriting guidelines are tailored to specific risk types the companys underwriting actuarial claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate performance monitoring mechanisms   risk management of underwriting and retrocession arrangements   underwriting risk and accumulation controls each segment and business unit manages its underwriting risk in accordance with established guidelines these guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors including ceding company profile line of business geographic location and risk hazards in each case the guidelines permit limited exceptions which must be authorized by the companys senior management management regularly reviews and revises these guidelines in response to changes in business unit market conditions risk versus reward analyses and the companys enterprise and underwriting risk management processes   the operating results and financial condition of the company can be adversely affected by catastrophe and other large losses the company manages its exposure to catastrophes and other large losses by           selective underwriting practices              diversifying its risk portfolio by geographic area and by types and classes of business              limiting its aggregate catastrophe loss exposure in any particular geographic zone and contiguous zones              purchasing reinsurance andor retrocessional protection to the extent that such coverage can be secured costeffectively see reinsurance and retrocession arrangements            9      table of contents      like other insurance and reinsurance companies the company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence whether a natural event such as a hurricane or an earthquake or other catastrophe such as an explosion at a major factory a large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties facultative certificates and across lines of business   the company focuses on potential losses that could result from any single event or series of events as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events accordingly the company employs various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain from any single catastrophic event or series of events in various geographic areas these techniques range from deterministic approaches such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastropheprone zones and applying reasonable damage factors to modeled approaches that attempt to scientifically measure catastrophe loss exposure using sophisticated monte carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis   no single computer model or group of models is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which the company conducts business in addition the form quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for the companys licensed models which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections further the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business units also while most models have been updated to incorporate claims information from recent catastrophic events catastrophe model projections are still inherently imprecise in addition uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles add to the already significant uncertainty of loss projections from models using historic long term frequency and severity data   nevertheless when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events   projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss pml the company defines pml as its anticipated loss taking into account contract terms and limits caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake the pml will vary depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the makeup of the in force book of business the projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods such as 100year events and 250year events for example a 100year pml is the estimated loss to the current inforce portfolio from a single event which has a 1 probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period in other words it corresponds to a 99 probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated pml it is important to note that pmls are estimates modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model as a result there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event pml   from an enterprise risk management perspective management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure the company may underwrite the limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors including but not limited to the companys financial resources and expected earnings and riskreward analyses of the business being underwritten   management estimates that the projected net economic loss from its largest 100year event in a given zone represents approximately 10 of its projected 2013 shareholders equity economic loss is the gross pml reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and estimated income taxes the impact of income taxes on the pml depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity which is also affected by interaffiliate reinsurance management also monitors and controls its largest pmls at multiple points along the loss distribution curve such as loss amounts at the 20 50 100 250 500 and 1000 year return periods this process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk underwriting and capital management decisions         10      table of contents      the companys catastrophe loss projections segmented by risk zones are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a

retrocessional protection by evaluating the underlying exposures in comparison to the availability of costeffective protection for the period from august 1 2012 to july 31 2013 the company has catastrophe loss reinsurance protection in place for losses arising from earthquakes of 61 of 100 million in excess of 190 million excluding the territories of the us japan and europe the company continues to evaluate the availability and cost of various retrocessional products and loss mitigation approaches in the marketplace   the company believes that its methods of monitoring analyzing and managing catastrophe exposures provide a credible risk management framework which are integrated with its enterprise risk management underwriting and capital management plans however there is much uncertainty and imprecision inherent in the catastrophe models and the catastrophe loss estimation process generally as a result there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses from individual events that exceed the pml or other return period projections perhaps by a material amount nor can there be assurance that the company will not experience events impacting multiple zones or multiple severe events that could in the aggregate exceed the companys pml expectations by a significant amount   terrorism risk  the company has limited exposure to losses from terrorism risk while the company writes some reinsurance contracts covering terrorism the companys risk management philosophy is to limit the amount of exposure by geographic region and to strictly manage coverage for properties in areas that may be considered a target for terrorists although providing terrorism coverage on reinsurance contracts is negotiable most insurance policies mandate inclusion of terrorism coverage as a result the company is exposed to losses from terrorism on its insurance book of business particularly its workers compensation and property policies however the insurance book generally does not insure large corporations or corporate locations that represent large concentrations of risk   because of the limited nature of terrorism exposure the us terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 and its amendments do not have a significant impact on company operations         11      table of contents      reinsurance and retrocession arrangements  the company does not typically purchase significant retrocessional coverage for specific reinsurance business written but it will do so when management deems it to be prudent andor costeffective to reinsure a portion of the risks being assumed the company participates in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties whereby a ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its reinsurers under one or more of its reinsurance treaties common account retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies including the ceding company with respect to the involved treaties   the company typically considers the purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance program exposures written by the insurance segment the type of reinsurance coverage considered is dependent upon individual risk exposures individual program exposures aggregate exposures by line of business overall segment and corporate wide exposures and the cost effectiveness of available reinsurance facultative reinsurance will typically be considered for large individual exposures and quota share reinsurance will generally be considered for entire programs of business   the company also considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection covering the potential accumulation of exposures such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the availability of costeffective retrocessional protection   all of the companys reinsurance and retrocessional agreements transfer significant reinsurance risk and therefore are accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance   at december 31 2012 the company had 6591 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to both paid and unpaid losses ceded of this amount 1815 million or 275 was receivable from cv starr bermuda cv starr 799 million or 121 was receivable from federal crop insurance company fcic 652 million or 99 was receivable from xl reinsurance america xl 580 million or 88 was receivable from berkley insurance company berkley and 541 million or 82 was receivable from transatlantic reinsurance company transatlantic the receivable from cv starr is fully collateralized by a trust agreement no other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5 of the companys receivables although management carefully selects its reinsurers the company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve the company of its liability to insureds or ceding companies see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition   claims reinsurance claims are managed by the companys professional claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial loss reports and coverage issues monitoring claims handling activities of ceding companies establishing and

casualty losses and lae significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the insurer by the reinsurer to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and lae insurers and reinsurers establish reserves which are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses for losses that have already occurred actual losses and lae paid may deviate perhaps substantially from such reserves to the extent reserves prove to be insufficient to cover actual losses and lae after taking into account available reinsurance coverage the company would have to recognize such reserve shortfalls and incur a charge to earnings which could be material in the period such recognition takes place see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  loss and lae reserves   as part of the reserving process insurers and reinsurers evaluate historical data and trends and make judgments as to the impact of various factors such as legislative and judicial developments that may affect future claim amounts changes in social and political attitudes that may increase loss exposures and inflationary and general economic trends while the reserving process is difficult and subjective for insurance companies the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer due primarily to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies in addition trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development in the same manner or to the same degree in the future as a result actual losses and lae may deviate perhaps substantially from estimates of reserves reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements   like many other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies the company has experienced adverse loss development for prior accident years which has led to increases in losses and lae reserves and corresponding charges to income loss in the periods in which the adjustments were made there can be no assurance that adverse development from prior years will not continue in the future or that such adverse development will not have a material adverse effect on net income loss   changes in historical reserves the following table shows changes in historical loss reserves for the company for 2002 and subsequent years the table is presented on a gaap basis

for unpaid losses and lae recorded at each year end date the upper paid portion of the table presents the related cumulative amounts paid through each subsequent year end the lower liability reestimated portion shows the reestimated amount of the original reserves as of the end of each succeeding year the reserve estimates have been revised as more information became known about the actual claims for which the reserves were carried the cumulative deficiencyredundancy line represents the cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was established it is equal to the initial reserve less the latest estimate of the ultimate liability   since the company has international operations some of its loss reserves are established in foreign currencies and converted to us dollars for financial reporting changes in conversion rates from period to period impact the us dollar value of carried reserves and correspondingly the cumulative deficiency line of the table however unlike other reserve development that affects net income loss the impact of currency translation is a component of other comprehensive income loss to differentiate these two reserve development components the translation impacts for each calendar year are reflected in the table of effects on pretax income resulting from reserve reestimates         13      table of contents      each amount other than the original reserves in the top half of the table below includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods for example if a loss settled in 2006 for 100000 was first reserved

 there has been minimal development in reserves since 2006 three classes of business were the principal contributors to the deficiencies through 2006 1 the runoff of asbestos claims for both direct and reinsurance business has significantly contributed to the cumulative deficiencies for all years presented through 2006 2 professional liability reinsurance general casualty reinsurance and workers compensation insurance contributed to the deficiencies for years 2002 and 2003 and 3 property catastrophe adverse development contributed to the deficiency for 2005   in 2007 the company completed a detailed study of its asbestos experience and its cedants asbestos exposures and also considered industry trends as a result of the study the company increased its gross reinsurance asbestos reserves by 2500 million and increased its gross direct asbestos reserves by 750 million these reserve increases as well as adverse development on asbestos in prior years have a significant impact on the cumulative deficiencies subsequent to the study the companys loss activity has been in line with expectations per the reserves established at december 31 2007 the companys aampe reserves represent managements best estimate of the ultimate liability however there can be no assurance that ultimate loss payments will not exceed such reserves perhaps by a significant amount no additional gross aampe reserve strengthening was made during 2008 through 2010 and only an insignificant amount of development occurred in 2011 and 2012   in the professional liability reinsurance class the early 2000s saw a proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other corporate financial andor management improprieties this resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of claims under the professional liability policies reinsured by the company in the general casualty area the company has experienced claim frequency and severity greater than expected in the companys pricing and initial reserving assumptions   in the workers compensation insurance class the majority of which was written in california the company has experienced adverse development primarily for accident year 2002 due to higher than expected claim frequency and severity as a result of significant growth in this book of business in a challenging business environment the companys writings in this class were subject to more relative variability than in some of its established andor stable lines of business although cumulative results through 2012 continue to be profitable for this book of business there was some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident year 2002   the adverse development on the 2008 outstanding reserves was primarily attributable to foreign exchange rate movements resulting in an increase in the us dollar reserves in addition the company experienced adverse development on liability exposures for subprime for accident years 20062008 and contractors liability exposures for accident years 20022005 the contractor liability exposures are currently in runoff the company also experienced adverse development on property lines but was offset by favorable development on other casualty lines   the companys loss and lae reserves represent managements best estimate of the ultimate liability while there can be no assurance that these reserves will not need to be increased in the future management believes that the companys existing reserves and reserving methodologies reduce the likelihood that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows these statements regarding the companys loss reserves are forward looking statements within the meaning of the us federal securities laws and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions contained therein see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  safe

reinsurance on calendar year operations by accident year for the same ten year period ended december 31 2012 each column represents the amount of net reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the reestimates are applicable the amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident years   since the company has operations in many countries part of the companys loss and lae reserves are in foreign currencies and translated to us dollars for each reporting period fluctuations in the exchange rates for the currencies period over period affect the us dollar amount of outstanding reserves the translation adjustment line at the bottom of the table eliminates the

result of the same factors described above that caused the deficiencies shown in the ten year gaap loss development table the unfavorable development experienced in the 2002 and prior accident years relate principally to the previously discussed asbestos development other business areas contributing to adverse development were casualty reinsurance including professional liability classes and workers compensation insurance where in retrospect the companys initial estimates of losses were underestimated principally as the result of unanticipated variability in the underlying exposures the favorable development for accident years 2003 through 2004 relates primarily to favorable experience with respect to property reinsurance business in addition casualty reinsurance has reflected favorable development for accident years 2003 to 2006   the companys loss reserving methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of loss and loss development trends seeking on a timely basis to

2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease for 2012 was attributable to a 572 million decrease in reinsurance business primarily related to favorable development on treaty casualty reserves partially offset by a 535 million increase in insurance business primarily related to development on contractors liability and workers compensation reserves   the increase for 2011 was attributable to a 1138 million increase in the insurance and us reinsurance business primarily related to development on contractors liability excess casualty and california workers compensation reserves partially offset by a 1101 million decrease in nonus reinsurance business primarily related to favorable development on noncatastrophe property reserves   the decrease for 2010 was attributable to a 1408 million decrease in nonus reinsurance business bermuda and international partially offset by the 1099 million increase in the insurance and us reinsurance business the decrease in the nonus reinsurance business was due to reserve studies that indicated net favorable reserve development as well as reductions in loss estimates for prior year catastrophes the increase in the us reinsurance business is primarily due to reserve strengthening in casualty lines for construction liability claims and the increase in the insurance business is due to reserve strengthening on several terminated programs   reserves for asbestos and environmental losses and lae at december 31 2012 the companys gross reserves for aampe claims represented 44 of its total reserves the companys aampe liabilities stem from mt mckinleys direct insurance business and everest res assumed reinsurance business there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the companys potential losses from aampe claims and ultimate values cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  asbestos and environmental exposures and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements   mt mckinleys book of direct aampe exposed insurance policies is relatively small and homogenous it arises from a limited period from 1975 to 1984 the book was principally excess liability thereby limiting exposure analysis to a limited number of policies and forms as a result of this focused structure the company believes that it is able to comprehensively analyze its exposures allowing it to identify analyze and actively monitor those claims which have unusual exposure including policies on which it may be exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits or on which nonproducts coverage may be contended         17      table of contents      the company endeavors to actively engage with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to mt mckinley such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement negotiation litigation or the monitoring of claim activity under settlement in place sip agreements sip agreements generally condition an insurers payment upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other measures to control the insurers payments the companys mt mckinley operation is currently managing four sip agreements one of which was executed prior to the acquisition of mt mckinley in 2000 the companys preference with respect to coverage settlements is to execute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty   the company has significantly enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics over time as well as its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active those insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous but still active management with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics which may indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity the company continually focuses on further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential exposure of policyholders   everest res book of assumed aampe reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a limited number of contracts and for a limited period from 1974 to 1984 because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the company has been managing the aampe exposures for many years its claim staff is familiar with the ceding companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to generate future liabilities the companys claim staff has developed familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims handling and reserving practices of those companies this level of familiarity enhances the quality of the companys analysis of its exposure through those companies as a result the company believes that it can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure such as nonproducts asbestos claims for concentrated attention however in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities the company relies on claims data supplied both formally and informally by its ceding companies and brokers this furnished information is not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeliness of the companys

investments the board of directors of each of the companys operating subsidiaries is responsible for establishing investment policy and guidelines and together with senior management for overseeing their execution   the companys principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet its insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize aftertax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio considering these objectives the company views its investment portfolio as having two components 1 the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities its core fixed maturities portfolio and 2 investments funded by the companys shareholders equity   for the portion needed to satisfy global outstanding liabilities the company generally invests in taxable and taxpreferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of aa3 for the us portion of this portfolio our mix of taxable and taxpreferenced investments is adjusted periodically consistent with the companys current and projected us operating results market conditions and our tax position this global fixed maturity securities portfolio is externally managed by an independent professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by the company   over the past several years the company has expanded the allocation of its investments funded by shareholders equity to include 1 a greater percentage of publicly traded equity securities 2 emerging market fixed maturities through mutual fund structures as well as individual holdings 3 high yield fixed maturities 4 bank loan securities and 5 private equity limited partnership investments the objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the riskadjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes which are also less subject to changes in value with movements in interest rates the company limits its allocation to these asset classes because of 1 the potential for volatility in their values and 2 the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models the company uses investment managers experienced in these markets and adjusts its allocation to these investments based upon market conditions at december 31 2012 the market value of investments in these investment market sectors carried at both market and fair value approximated 63 of shareholders equity   the duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early prepayments the companys fixed income investment guidelines include a general duration guideline this investment duration guideline is established and periodically revised by management which considers economic and business factors as well as the companys average duration of potential liabilities which at december 31 2012 is estimated at approximately 35 years based on the estimated payouts of underwriting liabilities using standard duration calculations         19      table of contents      the duration of the fixed income portfolio at december 31 2012 and 2011 was 30 years the company has shortened the duration of its portfolio in recent years in response to very low available yields particularly on securities with longer maturities as a result the company has focused on purchasing high quality shorter duration investments and investments with floating rate yields these investments will be less subject to decline in market value if interest rates rise in the future as forecasted by most investment analysts   for each currency in which the company has established substantial loss and lae reserves the company seeks to maintain invested assets denominated in such currency in an amount approximately equal to the estimated liabilities approximately 31 of the companys consolidated reserves for losses and lae and

respectively the decrease from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to the decline in reported income from fixed maturity securities primarily due to the effects of lower reinvestment rates over the past several years partially offset by an increase in income from limited partnership investments   the company had net realized capital gains for 2012 of 1644 million in 2012 the company recorded 1181 million of gains due to fair value remeasurements on fixed maturity and equity securities and 563 million of net realized capital gains from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities partially offset by 100 million of otherthantemporary impairments on fixed maturity securities in 2011 net realized capital gains were 69 million due to 275 million of net realized capital gains from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities partially offset by 162 million of otherthantemporary impairments on fixed maturity securities and 44 million of losses due to fair value remeasurements on fixed maturity and equity securities the gains on the sales of fixed maturity securities in 2011 were primarily the result of selling securities in foreign currencies which reduced exposure to future currency fluctuations in 2010 net realized capital gains were 1019 million due to 704 million of gains due to fair value remeasurements on fixed maturity and equity securities and 345 million of net realized capital gains from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities partially offset by 30 million of otherthantemporary impairments on fixed maturity securities the gains on the sales of fixed

affect on the companys business   competition the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive as well as cyclical by product and market as such financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of constrained availability high rates and strong profits followed by periods of abundant capacity low rates and constrained profitability competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that the company underwrites is based on many factors including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by am best andor standard amp poors underwriting expertise the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized capacity and coverages offered premiums charged other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered services offered speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written furthermore the market impact from these competitive factors related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels   the company competes in the us bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors the companys competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations including underwriting syndicates at lloyds some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company and have established long term and continuing business relationships which can be a significant competitive advantage in addition the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition   worldwide insurance and reinsurance market conditions continued to be very competitive particularly in the casualty lines of business generally there was ample insurance and reinsurance capacity relative to demand competition and its effect on rates terms and conditions vary widely by market and coverage yet continued to be most prevalent in the us casualty insurance and reinsurance markets         24      table of contents     however during the fourth quarter of 2012 the industry sustained significant losses from superstorm sandy and also sustained significant losses during 2011 from australian floods the new zealand earthquake the earthquake and tsunami in japan storms in the us and the thailand floods it is too early to determine the longer term impact on market conditions as a result of these events while the 2011 events have resulted in meaningful rate increases for catastrophe coverages in some global catastrophe prone regions particularly areas impacted by these losses whether the magnitude of these 2012 and 2011 losses is sufficient to increase rates and improve market conditions for other lines of business remains to be seen   overall the company believes that current marketplace conditions particularly for catastrophe coverages provide profit opportunities for it given its strong ratings distribution system reputation and expertise the company continues to employ its strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit potential
