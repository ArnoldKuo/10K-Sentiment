   in addition to the other information provided in this report the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in our securities if the circumstances contemplated by the individual risk factors materialize our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly   risks relating to our business   fluctuations in the financial markets could result in investment losses   prolonged and severe disruptions in the public debt and equity markets such as occurred during 2008 could result in significant realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio for the year ended december 31 2008 we incurred 6958 million of realized investment losses and 3104 million of unrealized investment losses although financial markets have significantly improved since 2008 they could deteriorate in the future such declines in the financial markets could result in significant realized and unrealized losses on investments and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations equity business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings         28      table of contents      our results could be adversely affected by catastrophic events   we are exposed to unpredictable catastrophic events including weatherrelated and other natural catastrophes as well as acts of terrorism any material reduction in our operating results caused by the occurrence of one or more catastrophes could inhibit our ability to pay dividends or to meet our interest and principal payment obligations subsequent to april 1 2010 we define a catastrophe as an event that causes a loss on property exposures before reinsurance of at least 100 million before corporate level reinsurance and taxes prior to april 1 2010 we used a threshold of 50 million by way of illustration during the past five calendar years pretax catastrophe losses net of contract specific reinsurance but before cessions under corporate reinsurance programs were as follows       calendar year  pretax catastrophe losses   dollars in millions          2012     4100     2011      13004     2010      5711     2009      674     2008      3643       our losses from future catastrophic events could exceed our projections   we use projections of possible losses from future catastrophic events of varying types and magnitudes as a strategic underwriting tool we use these loss projections to estimate our potential catastrophe losses in certain geographic areas and decide on the purchase of retrocessional coverage or other actions to limit the extent of potential losses in a given geographic area these loss projections are approximations reliant on a mix of quantitative and qualitative processes and actual losses may exceed the projections by a material amount resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations   if our loss reserves are inadequate to meet our actual losses our net income would be reduced or we could incur a loss   we are required to maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liability of losses and lae for both reported and unreported claims incurred these reserves are only estimates of what we believe the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances known to us in setting reserves for our reinsurance liabilities we rely on claim data supplied by our ceding companies and brokers and we employ actuarial and statistical projections the information received from our ceding companies is not always timely or accurate which can contribute to inaccuracies in our loss projections because of the uncertainties that surround our estimates of loss and lae reserves we cannot be certain that ultimate losses and lae payments will not exceed our estimates if our reserves are deficient we would be required to increase loss reserves in the period in which such deficiencies are identified which would cause a charge to our earnings and a reduction of capital by way of illustration during the past five calendar years the reserve reestimation process resulted in a decrease to our pretax net income in three of the years       calendar year  effect on pretax net income     dollars in millions              2012     37    increase    2011      37    decrease    2010      309    increase    2009      1288    decrease    2008      349    decrease      see item 1 business  changes in historical reserves which provides a more detailed chart showing the effect of reserve reestimates on calendar year operating results for the past ten years          29      table of contents      the difficulty in estimating our reserves is significantly more challenging as it relates to reserving for potential aampe liabilities at yearend 2012 44 of our gross reserves were comprised of aampe reserves aampe liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons including the long delays between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental contamination long reporting delays and difficulty in properly allocating liability for the asbestos or environmental damage legal tactics and judicial and legislative developments affecting the scope of insurers liability which can be difficult to predict also contribute to uncertainties in estimating reserves for aampe liabilities   the failure to accurately assess underwriting risk and establish adequate premium rates could reduce our net income or result in a net loss   our success depends on our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained if we fail to accurately assess the risks we retain we may fail to establish adequate premium rates to cover our losses and lae this could reduce our net income and even result in a net loss   in addition losses may arise from events or exposures that are not anticipated when the coverage is priced in addition to unanticipated events we also face the unanticipated expansion of our exposures particularly in longtail liability lines an example of this is the expansion over time of the scope of insurers legal liability within the mass tort arena particularly for aampe exposures discussed above   decreases in pricing for property and casualty reinsurance and insurance could reduce our net income   the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive as well as cyclical by product and market these cycles as well as other factors that influence aggregate supply and demand for property and casualty insurance and reinsurance products are outside of our control the supply of reinsurance is driven by prevailing prices and levels of capacity that may fluctuate in response to a number of factors including large catastrophic losses and investment returns being realized in the insurance industry demand for reinsurance is influenced by underwriting results of insurers and insureds including catastrophe losses and prevailing general economic conditions if any of these factors were to result in a decline in the demand for reinsurance or an overall increase in reinsurance capacity our net income could decrease   if rating agencies downgrade the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries future prospects for growth and profitability could be significantly and adversely affected   our active insurance company subsidiaries currently hold financial strength ratings assigned by thirdparty rating agencies which assess and rate the claims paying ability and financial strength of insurers and reinsurers our active subsidiaries carry an a superior rating from am best everest re bermuda re ireland re and everest national hold an a strong rating from standard amp poors everest re and bermuda re hold an aa3 excellent rating from moodys financial strength ratings are used by client companies and agents and brokers that place the business as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers a downgrade or withdrawal of any of these ratings might adversely affect our ability to market our insurance products and could have a material and adverse effect on future prospects for growth and profitability   on january 24 2012 moodys affirmed the ratings of our operating subsidiaries but changed the outlook on the ratings from stable to negative reflecting their opinion of the likely direction of the ratings over the medium term 12 to 18 months we will continue to work with moodys over this time to address their concerns but it is not possible to predict the potential outcome   on march 13 2009 standard amp poors downgraded its ratings of everest re bermuda re and everest national one level to a it is possible that a further downgrade will occur in the future if we do not continue to meet the evolving criteria expected of our current rating in that regard several of the rating agencies are in the process of modifying their approaches to evaluating enterprise risk management and its impact on ratings therefore we cannot predict the outcome of this reassessment or its potential impact upon our ratings         30      table of contents     consistent with market practice much of our treaty reinsurance business allows the ceding company to terminate the contract or seek collateralization of our obligations in the event of a rating downgrade below a certain threshold the termination provision would generally be triggered if a rating fell below am bests a rating level which is three levels below everest res current rating of a to a lesser extent everest re also has modest exposure to reinsurance contracts that contain provisions for obligatory funding of outstanding liabilities in the event of a rating agency downgrade those provisions would also generally be triggered if everest res rating fell below am bests a rating level   the failure of our insureds intermediaries and reinsurers to satisfy their obligations to us could reduce our income   in accordance with industry practice we have uncollateralized receivables from insureds agents and brokers andor rely on agents and brokers to process our payments we may not be able to collect amounts due from insureds agents and brokers resulting in a reduction to net income   we are subject to credit risk of reinsurers in connection with retrocessional arrangements because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve us of our liability to the insured in addition reinsurers may be unwilling to pay us even though they are able to do so the failure of one or more of our reinsurers to honor their obligations to us in a timely fashion would impact our cash flow and reduce our net income and could cause us to incur a significant loss   if we are unable or choose not to purchase reinsurance and transfer risk to reinsurers our net income could be reduced or we could incur a net loss in the event of unusual loss experience   we are generally less reliant on the purchase of reinsurance than many of our competitors in part because of our strategic emphasis on underwriting discipline and management of the cycles inherent in our business we try to separate our risk taking process from our risk mitigation process in order to avoid developing too great a reliance on reinsurance we generally purchase reinsurance from other third parties only when we expect a net benefit the percentage of business that we reinsure may vary considerably from year to year depending on our view of the relationship between cost and expected benefit for the contract period         2012   2011   2010   2009   2008    percentage of ceded written premiums to gross written premiums   53     41     61     48     47        changes in the availability and cost of reinsurance which are subject to market conditions that are outside of our control have reduced to some extent our ability to use reinsurance to tailor the risks we assume on a contract or program basis or to mitigate or balance exposures across our reinsurance operations because we have purchased minimal reinsurance in recent years our net income could be reduced following a large unreinsured event or adverse overall claims experience   our industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future   our industry is highly competitive and subject to pricing cycles that can be pronounced we compete globally in the united states bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous competitors our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations including underwriting syndicates at lloyds         31      table of contents     according to standard amp poors we rank among the top ten global reinsurance groups where more than twothirds of the market share is concentrated the worldwide net premium written by the traditional reinsurance market for both life and nonlife business was estimated to be 174 billion in 2011 according to data compiled by standard amp poors the top twentyfive groups in our industry represent just over 90 of these revenues the leaders in this market are munich re swiss re berkshire hathaway inc hannover ruckversicherung ag and syndicates at lloyds some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry which can be a significant competitive advantage in addition the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition   we are dependent on our key personnel   our success has been and will continue to be dependent on our ability to retain the services of existing key executive officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future the loss of the services of any key executive officer or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct business generally we consider key executive officers to be those individuals who have the greatest influence in setting overall policy and controlling operations chairman and chief executive officer joseph v taranto age 63 president dominic j addesso age 59 and executive vice president and chief financial officer craig howie age 49 we currently have employment contracts with mr taranto and mr addesso mr tarantos contract was filed with the sec and provides for terms of employment ending on december 31 2013 mr addessos contract was filed with the sec and provides for terms of employment ending december 31 2016   special considerations apply to our bermuda operations under bermuda law nonbermudians other than spouses of bermudians and individuals holding permanent or working resident certificates are not permitted to engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without a work permit issued by the bermuda government a work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show that after a proper public advertisement no bermudian spouse of a bermudian or individual holding a permanent or working resident certificate is available who meets the minimum standards reasonably required for the position the bermuda government places a sixyear term limit on individuals with work permits subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be key employees of businesses with a significant physical presence in bermuda currently all four of our bermudabased professional employees who require work permits have been granted permits by the bermuda government that expire at various times between september 2013 and may 2015 this includes mark de saram the chief executive officer of our bermuda reinsurance operation in the event his work permit were not renewed we could lose his services thereby adversely affecting our ability to conduct our business in bermuda until we were able to replace him with an individual in bermuda who did not require a work permit or who was granted the permit the company has an employment contract with mr de saram which was filed with the sec and provides for term of employment ending on november 1 2014   our investment values and investment income could decline because they are exposed to interest rate credit and market risks   a significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and smaller portions consist of equity securities and other investments both the fair market value of our invested assets and associated investment income fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions for example the fair market value of our predominant fixed income portfolio generally increases or decreases inversely to fluctuations in interest rates the market value of our fixed income securities could also decrease as a result of a downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of such securities to deteriorate the net investment income that we realize from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates   interest rate fluctuations also can cause net investment income from fixed income investments that carry prepayment risk such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities to differ from the income anticipated from those securities at the time of purchase in addition if issuers of individual investments are unable to meet their obligations investment income will be reduced and realized capital losses may arise         32      table of contents     the majority of our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale and temporary changes in the market value of these investments are reflected as changes to our shareholders equity our actively managed equity security portfolios are fair valued and any changes in fair value are reflected as net realized capital gains or losses as a result a decline in the value of our securities reduces our capital or could cause us to incur a loss   we have invested a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities the value of these assets fluctuates with changes in the markets in times of economic weakness the fair value of these assets may decline and may negatively impact net income we also invest in nontraditional investments which have different risk characteristics than traditional fixed income and equity securities these alternative investments are comprised primarily of private equity limited partnerships the changes in value and investment incomeloss for these partnerships may be more volatile than overthecounter securities   the following table quantifies the portion of our investment portfolio that consists of fixed income securities equity securities and investments that carry prepayment risk

rounding                      we may experience foreign currency exchange losses that reduce our net income and capital levels   through our bermuda and international operations we conduct business in a variety of foreign nonus currencies principally the euro the british pound the canadian dollar and the singapore dollar assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates our functional currency is the us dollar and exchange rate fluctuations relative to the us dollar may materially impact our results and financial position in 2012 we wrote approximately 310 of our coverages in nonus currencies as of december 31 2012 we maintained approximately 173 of our investment portfolio in investments denominated in nonus currencies during 2012 2011 and 2010 the impact on our quarterly pretax net income from exchange rate fluctuations ranged from a loss of 170 million to a gain of 318 million   we are subject to cybersecurity risks that could negatively impact our business operations    we are dependent upon our information technology platform including our processing systems data and electronic transmissions in our business operations security breaches could expose us to the loss or misuse of our information litigation and potential liability in addition cyber incidents that impact the availability reliability speed accuracy or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant negative impact on our operations and possibly our results an incident could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws damage our reputation cause a loss of customers or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties which could be significant management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our operations          33      table of contents     risks relating to regulation   insurance laws and regulations restrict our ability to operate and any failure to comply with those laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business   we are subject to extensive and increasing regulation under us state and foreign insurance laws these laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to us by our operating subsidiaries impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that we can hold prescribe solvency accounting and internal control standards that must be met and maintained and require us to maintain reserves these laws also require disclosure of material interaffiliate transactions and require prior approval of extraordinary transactions such extraordinary transactions include declaring dividends from operating subsidiaries that exceed statutory thresholds these laws also generally require approval of changes of control of insurance companies the application of these laws could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends interest and other payments on securities as applicable and could restrict our ability to expand our business operations through acquisitions of new insurance subsidiaries we may not have or maintain all required licenses and approvals or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us these types of actions could have a material adverse effect on our business to date no material fine penalty or restriction has been imposed on us for failure to comply with any insurance law or regulation   as a result of the recent dislocation of the financial markets congress and the presidential administration in the united states are contemplating changes in the way the financial services industry is regulated it is possible that insurance regulation will be drawn into this process and that federal regulatory initiatives in the insurance industry could emerge in addition regulatory bodies in europe are developing a new capital adequacy directive for insurers and reinsurers the future impact of such initiatives if any on our operation net income loss or financial condition cannot be determined at this time   regulatory challenges in the united states could adversely affect the ability of bermuda re to conduct business   bermuda re does not intend to be licensed or admitted as an insurer or reinsurer in any us jurisdiction under current law bermuda re generally will be permitted to reinsure us risks from its office in bermuda without obtaining those licenses however the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework is subject to periodic legislative review and revision in the past there have been congressional and other initiatives in the united states regarding increased supervision and regulation of the insurance industry including proposals to supervise and regulate reinsurers domiciled outside the united states if bermuda re were to become subject to any insurance laws of the united states or any us state at any time in the future it might be required to post deposits or maintain minimum surplus levels and might be prohibited from engaging in lines of business or from writing some types of policies complying with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business in bermuda and international markets   bermuda re may need to be licensed or admitted in additional jurisdictions to develop its business   as bermuda res business develops it will monitor the need to obtain licenses in jurisdictions other than bermuda and the uk where it has an authorized branch in order to comply with applicable law or to be able to engage in additional insurancerelated activities in addition bermuda re may be at a competitive disadvantage in jurisdictions where it is not licensed or does not enjoy an exemption from licensing relative to competitors that are so licensed or exempt from licensing bermuda re may not be able to obtain any additional licenses that it determines are necessary or desirable furthermore the process of obtaining those licenses is often costly and may take a long time         34      table of contents      bermuda res ability to write reinsurance may be severely limited if it is unable to arrange for security to back its reinsurance   many jurisdictions do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or nonadmitted insurers on their statutory financial statements without appropriate security bermuda res reinsurance clients typically require it to post a letter of credit or enter into other security arrangements if bermuda re is unable to obtain or maintain a letter of credit facility on commercially acceptable terms or is unable to arrange for other types of security its ability to operate its business may be severely limited if bermuda re defaults on any letter of credit that it obtains it may be required to prematurely liquidate a substantial portion of its investment portfolio and other assets pledged as collateral   risks relating to groups securities   because of our holding company structure our ability to pay dividends interest and principal is dependent on our receipt of dividends loan payments and other funds from our subsidiaries   group and holdings are holding companies each of whose most significant asset consists of the stock of its operating subsidiaries as a result each of groups and holdings ability to pay dividends interest or other payments on its securities in the future will depend on the earnings and cash flows of the operating subsidiaries and the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to it this ability is subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors beyond our control payment of dividends and advances and repayments from some of the operating subsidiaries are regulated by us state and foreign insurance laws and regulatory restrictions including minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds accordingly the operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to group and holdings in the future which could prevent us from paying dividends interest or other payments on our securities   provisions in groups byelaws could have an antitakeover effect which could diminish the value of its common shares   groups byelaws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so in addition these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable the effect of these provisions could be to prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future   for example groups byelaws contain the following provisions that could have an antitakeover effect           directors currently serve staggered threeyear terms meaning that the members of only one of three classes of directors are selected each year although the staggered board structure will be phased out between 2012 and 2014              shareholders have limited ability to remove directors              the total voting power of any shareholder owning more than 99 of the common shares will be reduced to 99 of the total voting power of the common shares            35      table of contents               the board of directors may decline to register any transfer of common shares if it has reason to believe that the transfer would result in          i    any person that is not an investment company beneficially owning more than 50 of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group          ii    any person holding controlled shares in excess of 99 of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group or          iii    any adverse tax regulatory or legal consequences to group any of its subsidiaries or any of its shareholders              group also has the option to redeem or purchase all or part of a shareholders common shares to the extent the board of directors determines it is necessary or advisable to avoid or cure any adverse or potential adverse consequences if          i    any person that is not an investment company beneficially owns more than 50 of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group                   ii    any person holds controlled shares in excess of 99 of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group or                   iii    share ownership by any person may result in adverse tax regulatory or legal consequences to group any of its subsidiaries or any other shareholder      the board of directors has indicated that it will apply these byelaw provisions in such manner that passive institutional investors will be treated similarly to investment companies for this purpose passive institutional investors include all persons who are eligible pursuant to rule 13d1b1 under the us securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act to file a shortform statement on schedule 13g other than an insurance company or any parent holding company or control person of an insurance company   applicable insurance laws may also have an antitakeover effect   before a person can acquire control of a us insurance company prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where that insurance company is domiciled or deemed commercially domiciled prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurance company a state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant the integrity and competence of the applicants board of directors and executive officers the acquirors plans for the future operations of the insurance company and any anticompetitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control because any person who acquired control of group would thereby acquire indirect control of its insurance company subsidiaries in the us the insurance change of control laws of delaware california and georgia would apply to such a transaction this could have the effect of delaying or even preventing such a change of control   the ownership of common shares of group by holdings may have an impact on securing approval of shareholder proposals that groups management supports   as of december 31 2012 holdings owned 9719971 or 159 of the outstanding common shares of group under groups byelaws the total voting power of any shareholder owning more than 99 of the common shares is reduced to 99 of the total voting power of the common shares nevertheless holdings which is controlled by group has the ability to vote 99 of the total voting power of groups common shares which may have an impact on securing approval of shareholder proposals that groups management supports         36      table of contents      investors in group may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than investors in a us corporation   the companies act 1981 of bermuda the companies act differs in material respects from the laws applicable to us corporations and their shareholders the following is a summary of material differences between the companies act as modified in some instances by provisions of groups byelaws and delaware corporate law that could make it more difficult for investors in group to protect their interests than investors in a us corporation because the following statements are summaries they do not address all aspects of bermuda law that may be relevant to group and its shareholders   alternate directors groups byelaws provide as permitted by bermuda law that each director may appoint an alternate director who shall have the power to attend and vote at any meeting of the board of directors or committee at which that director is not personally present and to sign written consents in place of that director delaware law does not provide for alternate directors   committees of the board of directors groups byelaws provide as permitted by bermuda law that the board of directors may delegate any of its powers to committees that the board appoints and those committees may consist partly or entirely of nondirectors delaware law allows the board of directors of a corporation to delegate many of its powers to committees but those committees may consist only of directors   interested directors bermuda law and groups byelaws provide that if a director has a personal interest in a transaction to which the company is also a party and if the director discloses the nature of this personal interest at the first opportunity either at a meeting of directors or in writing to the directors then the company will not be able to declare the transaction void solely due to the existence of that personal interest and the director will not be liable to the company for any profit realized from the transaction in addition after a director has made the declaration of interest referred to above he or she is allowed to be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which he or she has an interest unless disqualified from doing so by the chairman of the relevant board meeting under delaware law an interested director could be held liable for a transaction in which that director derived an improper personal benefit additionally under delaware law a corporation may be able to declare a transaction with an interested director to be void unless one of the following conditions is fulfilled           the material facts as to the interested directors relationship or interests are disclosed or are known to the board of directors and the board in good faith authorizes the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors              the material facts are disclosed or are known to the shareholders entitled to vote on the transaction and the transaction is specifically approved in good faith by the holders of a majority of the voting shares or              the transaction is fair to the corporation as of the time it is authorized approved or ratified      transactions with significant shareholders as a bermuda company group may enter into business transactions with its significant shareholders including asset sales in which a significant shareholder receives or could receive a financial benefit that is greater than that received or to be received by other shareholders with prior approval from groups board of directors but without obtaining prior approval from the shareholders in the case of an amalgamation in which two or more companies join together and continue as a single company a resolution of shareholders approved by a majority of at least 75 of the votes cast is required in addition to the approval of the board of directors except in the case of an amalgamation with and between whollyowned subsidiaries if group was a delaware corporation any business combination with an interested shareholder which for this purpose would include mergers and asset sales of greater than 10 of groups assets that would otherwise be considered transactions in the ordinary course of business within a period of three years from the time the person became an interested shareholder would require prior approval from shareholders holding at least 66 23 of groups outstanding common shares not owned by the interested shareholder unless the transaction qualified for one of the exemptions in the relevant delaware statute or group opted out of the statute for purposes of the delaware statute an interested shareholder is generally defined as a person who together with that persons affiliates and associates owns or within the previous three years did own 15 or more of a corporations outstanding voting shares         37      table of contents     takeovers under bermuda law if an acquiror makes an offer for shares of a company and within four months of the offer the holders of not less than 90 of the shares that are the subject of the offer tender their shares the acquiror may give the nontendering shareholders notice requiring them to transfer their shares on the terms of the offer within one month of receiving the notice dissenting shareholders may apply to the court objecting to the transfer the burden is on the dissenting shareholders to show that the court should exercise its discretion to enjoin the transfer the court will be unlikely to do this unless there is evidence of fraud or bad faith or collusion between the acquiror and the tendering shareholders aimed at unfairly forcing out minority shareholders

reasonably related to that persons interest as a shareholder   shareholders suits the rights of shareholders under bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders under legislation or judicial precedent in many us jurisdictions class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda however the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent which would permit a shareholder to bring an action in the name of group to remedy a wrong done to group where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of group or illegal or would result in the violation of groups memorandum of association or byelaws furthermore the court would give consideration to acts that are alleged

however these provisions may not limit liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law the authorization of unlawful dividends stock repurchases or stock redemptions or any transaction from which a director         38      table of contents     derived an improper personal benefit moreover

enforcement of civil liabilities group is organized under the laws of bermuda some of its directors and officers may reside outside the us a substantial portion of our assets are or may be located in

reasonable grounds for believing that the company after the payment is made would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or that the realizable value of the companys assets would be less as a result of the payment than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts the share capital account represents the aggregate par value of issued shares and the share premium account represents the aggregate amount paid for issued shares over and above their par value under delaware law subject to any restrictions contained in a companys certificate

surplus is the amount by which the net assets of a corporation exceed its stated capital delaware law also provides that dividends may not be paid out of net profits at any time when stated capital is less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets   risks relating to taxation   if us tax law changes our net income may be reduced   in the last few years some members of congress have expressed concern about us corporations that move their place of incorporation to lowtax jurisdictions also some members of congress have expressed concern over a competitive advantage that foreigncontrolled insurers and reinsurers may have over us controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the purchase of reinsurance by us insurers from affiliates operating in some foreign jurisdictions including bermuda it is possible that future legislation that would be disadvantageous to our bermuda insurance subsidiaries could be enacted if any such legislation were enacted the us tax burden on our bermuda operations or on some business ceded from our licensed us insurance subsidiaries to some offshore reinsurers could be increased this would reduce our net income         39      table of contents      group andor bermuda re may be subject to us corporate income tax which would reduce our net income   bermuda re the income of bermuda re is a significant portion of our worldwide income from operations we have established guidelines for the conduct of our operations that are designed to ensure that bermuda re is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the us based on its compliance with those guidelines we believe that bermuda re should not be required to pay us corporate income tax other than withholding tax on us source dividend income however if the internal revenue service irs were to successfully assert that bermuda re was engaged in a trade or business bermuda re would be required to pay us corporate income tax on all of its income and possibly the us branch profits tax however if the irs were to successfully assert that bermuda re was engaged in a us trade or business we believe the usbermuda tax treaty would preclude the irs from taxing bermuda res income except to the extent that its income was attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by that subsidiary we do not believe that bermuda re has a permanent establishment in the us if the irs were to successfully assert that bermuda re did have income attributable to a permanent establishment in the us bermuda re would be subject to us tax only on that income   group  we conduct our operations in a manner designed to minimize our us tax exposure  based on our compliance with guidelines designed to ensure that we generate only immaterial amounts if any of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us we believe that we should be required to pay only immaterial amounts if any of us corporate income tax other than withholding tax on us source dividend income however if the irs successfully asserted that we had material amounts of income that was subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us we would be required to pay us corporate income tax on that income and possibly the us branch profits tax the imposition of such tax would reduce our net income   if bermuda re became subject to us income tax on its income or if we became subject to us income tax our income could also be subject to the us branch profits tax in that event group and bermuda re would be subject to taxation at a higher combined effective rate than if they were organized as us corporations the combined effect of the 35 us corporate income tax rate and the 30 branch profits tax rate is a net tax rate of 545 the imposition of these taxes would reduce our net income   group andor bermuda re may become subject to bermuda tax which would reduce our net income   group and bermuda re are not subject to income or profits tax withholding tax or capital gains taxes in bermuda both companies have received an assurance from the bermuda minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection amendment act of 2011 to the effect that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that imposes any tax computed on profits or income or computed on any capital asset gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax then that tax will not apply to us or to any of our operations or our shares debentures or other obligations until march 31 2035 this assurance does not prevent the application of any of those taxes to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda and does not prevent the imposition of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the land tax act 1967 of bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to any land leased to group or bermuda re   our net income will be reduced if us excise and withholding taxes are increased   bermuda re is subject to federal excise tax on reinsurance and insurance premiums with respect to risks located in the us in addition bermuda re is subject to withholding tax on dividend income from us sources these taxes could increase and other taxes could be imposed in the future on bermuda res business which would reduce our net income
