january 2 2011 heartland specializes in crop insurance which is written mainly through everest national      reinsurance industry overview reinsurance is an arrangement in which an insurance company the reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurance or reinsurance company the ceding company against all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more insurance contracts reinsurance can provide a ceding company with several benefits including a reduction in its net liability on individual risks or classes of risks catastrophe protection from large andor multiple losses andor a reduction in operating leverage as measured by the ratio of net premiums and reserves to capital reinsurance also provides a ceding company with additional underwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write more business than would be acceptable relative to the ceding companys financial resources reinsurance does not discharge the ceding company from its liability to policyholders rather it reimburses the ceding company for covered losses   there are two basic types of reinsurance arrangements treaty and facultative treaty reinsurance obligates the ceding company to cede and the reinsurer to assume a specified portion of a type or category of risks insured by the ceding company treaty reinsurers do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under their treaties instead the reinsurer relies upon the pricing and underwriting decisions made by the ceding company in facultative reinsurance the ceding company cedes and the reinsurer assumes all or part of the risk under a single insurance contract facultative reinsurance is negotiated separately for each insurance contract that is reinsured facultative reinsurance when purchased by ceding companies usually is intended to cover individual risks not covered by their reinsurance treaties because of the dollar limits involved or because the risk is unusual   both treaty and facultative reinsurance can be written on either a pro rata basis or an excess of loss basis under pro rata reinsurance the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion under excess of loss reinsurance the reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses and expenses in excess of a specified dollar amount known as the ceding companys retention or reinsurers attachment point generally subject to a negotiated reinsurance contract limit   in pro rata reinsurance the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission the ceding commission generally is based on the ceding companys cost of acquiring the business being reinsured commissions premium taxes assessments and miscellaneous administrative expense and may contain profit sharing provisions whereby the ceding commission is adjusted based on loss experience premiums paid by the ceding company to a reinsurer for excess of loss reinsurance are not directly proportional to the premiums that the ceding company receives because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk there is usually no ceding commission on excess of loss reinsurance   reinsurers may purchase reinsurance to cover their own risk exposure reinsurance of a reinsurers business is called a retrocession reinsurance companies cede risks under retrocessional agreements to other reinsurers known as retrocessionaires for reasons similar to those that cause insurers to purchase reinsurance to reduce net liability on individual or classes of risks protect against catastrophic losses stabilize financial ratios and obtain additional underwriting capacity   reinsurance can be written through intermediaries generally professional reinsurance brokers or directly with ceding companies from a ceding companys perspective the broker and the direct distribution channels have advantages and disadvantages a ceding companys decision to select one distribution channel over the other will be influenced by its perception of such advantages and disadvantages relative to the reinsurance coverage being placed        3          business strategy the companys business strategy is to sustain its leadership position within targeted reinsurance and insurance markets provide effective management throughout the property and casualty underwriting cycle and thereby achieve an attractive return for its shareholders the companys underwriting strategies seek to capitalize on its i financial strength and capacity ii global franchise iii stable and experienced management team iv diversified product and distribution offerings v underwriting expertise and disciplined approach

companys products include the full range of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance coverages including marine aviation surety errors and omissions liability eampo directors and officers liability dampo medical malpractice other specialty lines accident and health aamph and workers compensation   the companys underwriting strategies emphasizes underwriting profitability over premium volume key elements of this strategy include careful risk selection appropriate pricing through strict underwriting discipline and adjustment of the companys business mix in response to changing market conditions the company focuses on reinsuring companies that effectively manage the underwriting cycle through proper analysis and pricing of underlying risks and whose underwriting guidelines and performance are compatible with its objectives   the companys underwriting strategies emphasize flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions the company believes that its existing strengths including its broad underwriting expertise global presence strong financial ratings and substantial capital facilitate adjustments to its mix of business geographically by line of business and by type of coverage allowing it to participate in those market opportunities that provide the greatest potential for underwriting profitability the companys insurance operations complement these strategies by accessing business that is not available on a reinsurance basis the company carefully monitors its mix of business across all operations to avoid unacceptable geographic or other risk concentrations   marketing the company writes business on a worldwide basis for many different customers and lines of business thereby obtaining a broad spread of risk the company is not substantially dependent on any single customer small group of customers line of business or geographic area for the 2014 calendar year no single customer ceding company or insured generated more than 3 of the companys gross written premiums the company believes that a reduction of business from any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on its future financial condition or results of operations   approximately 65 21 and 14 of the companys 2014 gross written premiums were written in the broker reinsurance insurance markets and direct reinsurance respectively   the broker reinsurance market consists of several substantial national and international brokers and a number of smaller specialized brokers brokers do not have the authority to bind the company with respect to reinsurance agreements nor does the company commit in advance to accept any portion of a brokers submitted business reinsurance business from any ceding company whether new or renewal is subject to acceptance by the company brokerage fees are generally paid by reinsurers the companys ten largest brokers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 60 of gross written premiums in 2014 the largest broker marsh and mclennan accounts for approximately 23 of gross written premiums the second largest broker aon benfield re accounted for approximately 20 of gross written premiums the company believes that a reduction of business assumed from any one broker would not have a material adverse effect on the company   the direct reinsurance market remains an important distribution channel for reinsurance business written by the company direct placement of reinsurance enables the company to access clients who prefer to place their reinsurance directly with reinsurers based upon the reinsurers indepth understanding of the ceding companys needs        4          the companys insurance business writes direct business targeting commercial property and casualty it also writes

the risks see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  safe harbor disclosure        8          underwriting one of the companys strategies is to lead as many of the reinsurance treaties it underwrites as possible the company leads on approximately twothirds of its treaty reinsurance business as measured by premium the lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in the strongest position to negotiate price terms and conditions management believes this strategy enables it to obtain more favorable terms and conditions on the treaties on which it participates when the company does not lead the treaty it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty the company may decline to participate on a treaty based upon its assessment of all relevant factors   the companys treaty underwriting process involves a team approach among the companys underwriters actuaries and claim staff treaties are reviewed for compliance with the companys general underwriting standards and most larger treaties are subjected to detailed actuarial analysis the actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the subject exposures and loss experience the company does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties the company does however evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty the company may also conduct underwriting operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding companies to monitor adherence to underwriting guidelines underwriting audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff pricing and risk selection and rate monitoring over time claim audits may be performed in order to evaluate the clients claims handling abilities and practices   the companys facultative underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks limits and maximum risk exposures specified classes of large premium us risks are referred to everest res new york facultative headquarters for specific review before premium quotations are given to clients in addition the companys guidelines require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate limits complexity or volatility regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract nonus risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within the involved operations   in addition to its own underwriting staff the companys insurance operations write casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through select program managers these programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and the program managers capabilities the companys rates forms and underwriting guidelines are tailored to specific risk types the companys underwriting actuarial claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate performance monitoring mechanisms   risk management of underwriting and retrocession arrangements   underwriting risk and accumulation controls each segment and business unit manages its underwriting risk in accordance with established guidelines these guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors including ceding company profile line of business geographic location and risk hazards in each case the guidelines permit limited exceptions which must be authorized by the companys senior management management regularly reviews and revises these guidelines in response to changes in business unit market conditions risk versus reward analyses and the companys enterprise and underwriting risk management processes   the operating results and financial condition of the company can be adversely affected by catastrophe and other large losses the company manages its exposure to catastrophes and other large losses by           selective underwriting practices              diversifying its risk portfolio by geographic area and by types and classes of business              limiting its aggregate catastrophe loss exposure in any particular geographic zone and contiguous zones              purchasing reinsurance andor retrocessional protection to the extent that such coverage can be secured costeffectively see reinsurance and retrocession arrangements           9          like other insurance and reinsurance companies the company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence whether a natural event such as a hurricane or an earthquake or other catastrophe such as an explosion at a major factory a large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties facultative certificates and direct insurance policies across various lines of business   the company focuses on potential losses that could result from any single event or series of events as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events accordingly the company employs various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain from any single catastrophic event or series of events in various geographic areas these techniques range from deterministic approaches such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastropheprone zones and applying reasonable damage factors to modeled approaches that attempt to scientifically measure catastrophe loss exposure using sophisticated monte carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of potential losses on a probabilistic basis   no single computer model or group of models is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which the company conducts business in addition the form quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for the companys licensed models which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections further the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined to estimate potential losses by and across business units also while most models have been updated to incorporate claims information from recent catastrophic events catastrophe model projections are still inherently imprecise in addition uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles could add further uncertainty to loss projections from models based on historical data   nevertheless when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events   projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss pml the company defines pml as its anticipated loss taking into account contract terms and limits caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake the pml will vary depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the makeup of the in force book of business the projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods such as 100year events and 250year events for example a 100year pml is the estimated loss to the current inforce portfolio from a single event which has a 1 probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period in other words it corresponds to a 99 probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated pml it is important to note that pmls are estimates modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model as a result there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event pml   from an enterprise risk management perspective management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure the company may underwrite the limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors including but not limited to the companys financial resources and expected earnings and riskreward analyses of the business being underwritten   the company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of its operations reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing terms conditions and availability of coverage with the aim of securing cost effective protection the amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time reflecting the companys view of its exposures and the cost of reinsurance        10          management estimates that the projected net economic loss from its largest 100year event in a given zone represents approximately 11 of its projected 2015 shareholders equity economic loss is the pml exposure net of third party reinsurance and the noncontrolling interests of mt logan re reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and estimated income taxes the impact of income taxes on the pml depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity which is also affected by interaffiliate reinsurance management also monitors and controls its largest pmls at multiple points along the loss distribution curve such as loss amounts at the 20 50 100 250 500 and 1000 year return periods this process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk underwriting and capital management decisions   the companys catastrophe loss projections segmented by risk zones are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process the table

management framework which is integrated with its enterprise risk management underwriting and capital management plans however there is much uncertainty and imprecision inherent in the catastrophe models and the catastrophe loss estimation process generally as a result there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses from individual events that exceed the pml or other return period projections perhaps by a material amount nor can there be assurance that the company will not experience events impacting multiple zones or multiple severe events that could in the aggregate exceed the companys pml expectations by a significant amount   terrorism risk  while the company writes some reinsurance contracts covering terrorism the companys risk management philosophy is to limit the amount of exposure by geographic region and to strictly manage coverage for properties in areas that may be considered a target for terrorists providing terrorism coverage on reinsurance contracts is negotiable and many but not all treaties exclude this coverage most insurance policies however mandate inclusion of terrorism coverage as a result the company is exposed to losses from terrorism on both its reinsurance and its insurance book of business particularly its workers compensation and property policies however the insurance book generally does not insure large corporations or corporate locations that represent large concentrations of risk   the us terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 could provide some protection to the insurance book of business it might also provide indirect protection to exposed reinsurance treaties however the company is still exposed to risk of loss from terrorism due to deductibles copays and uncovered lines of business        11          reinsurance and retrocession arrangements  the company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of its operations reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing terms conditions and availability of coverage with the aim of securing cost effective protection the amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time reflecting the companys view of its exposures and the cost of reinsurance in recent years the company has increased its use of reinsurance offered through capital market facilities   the company participates in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties whereby a ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its reinsurers under one or more of its reinsurance treaties common account retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies including the ceding company with respect to the involved treaties   all of the companys reinsurance and retrocessional agreements transfer significant reinsurance risk and therefore are accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance   at december 31 2014 the company had 6709 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to both paid and unpaid losses ceded of this amount 1023 million or 152 was receivable from cv starr bermuda cv starr 750 million or

resolution group are fully collateralized by individual trust agreements no other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5 of our receivables although management carefully selects its reinsurers the company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve the company of its liability to insureds or ceding companies see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition   claims reinsurance claims are managed by the companys professional claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial loss reports and coverage issues monitoring claims handling activities of ceding companies establishing and adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of claims in addition to claims assessment processing and payment the claims staff selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies insurance claims except those relating to mt mckinleys business are generally handled by third party claims service providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the companys professional claims staff   the company intensively manages its asbestos and environmental aampe exposures through dedicated centrally managed claim staffs for mt mckinley and everest re both are staffed with experienced claim and legal professionals who specialize in the handling of such exposures these units actively manage each individual insured and reinsured account responding to claim developments with evaluations of the involved exposures and adjustment of reserves as appropriate specific or general claim developments that may have material implications for the company are regularly communicated to senior management actuarial legal and financial areas senior management and claim management personnel meet at least quarterly to review the companys overall reserve positions and make changes if appropriate the company continually reviews its internal processing communications and analytics seeking to enhance the management of its aampe exposures in particular in regard to changes in asbestos claims and litigation        12          reserves for unpaid property and casualty losses and lae significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the insurer by the reinsurer to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and lae insurers and reinsurers establish reserves which are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses for losses that have already occurred actual losses and lae paid may deviate perhaps substantially from such reserves to the extent reserves prove to be insufficient to cover actual losses and lae after taking into account available reinsurance coverage the company would have to recognize such reserve shortfalls and incur a charge to earnings which could be material in the period such recognition takes place see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  loss and lae reserves   as part of the reserving process insurers and reinsurers evaluate historical data and trends and make judgments as to the impact of various factors such as legislative and judicial developments that may affect future claim amounts changes in social and political attitudes that may increase loss exposures and inflationary and general economic trends while the reserving process is difficult and subjective for insurance companies the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer due primarily to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies in addition trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development in the same manner or to the same degree in the future as a result actual losses and lae may deviate perhaps substantially from estimates of reserves reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements   like many other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies the company has experienced adverse loss development for prior accident years which has led to increases in losses and lae reserves and corresponding charges to income loss in the periods in which the adjustments were made there can be no assurance that adverse development from prior years will not continue in the future or that such adverse development will not have a material adverse effect on net income loss   changes in historical reserves the following table shows changes in historical loss reserves for the company for 2004 and subsequent years the table is presented on a gaap basis except that the companys loss reserves for its canadian branch operations are presented in canadian dollars the impact of which is not material the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and lae recorded at each year end date the upper paid portion of the table presents the related cumulative amounts paid through each subsequent year end the lower liability reestimated portion shows the reestimated amount of the original reserves as of the end of each succeeding year the reserve estimates have been revised as more information became known about the actual claims for which the reserves were carried the cumulative deficiencyredundancy line represents the cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was established it is equal to the initial reserve less the latest estimate of the ultimate liability   since the company has international operations some of its loss reserves are established in foreign currencies and converted to us dollars for financial reporting changes in conversion rates from period to period impact the us dollar value of carried reserves and correspondingly the cumulative deficiency line of the table however unlike other reserve development that affects net income loss the impact of currency translation is a component of other comprehensive income loss to differentiate these two reserve development components the translation impacts for each calendar year are reflected in the table of effects on pretax income resulting from reserve reestimates        13          each amount other than the original reserves in the top half of the table below includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods for example if a loss settled in 2007 for 100000 was first reserved in 2004 at 60000 and remained unchanged until settlement the 40000 deficiency actual loss minus original estimate would affect the cumulative deficiency for each of the years in 2004 through 2006 conditions and trends that have affected development of the ultimate liability in the past are not indicative of future developments accordingly it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table        ten year gaap loss development table presented net of reinsurance

2 property catastrophe adverse development contributed to the deficiency for 2005   in the professional liability reinsurance class the early 2000s saw a proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other corporate financial andor management improprieties this resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of claims under the professional liability policies reinsured by

the workers compensation insurance class the majority of which was written in california the company has experienced adverse development primarily for accident year 2002 due to higher than expected claim frequency and severity as a result of significant growth in this book of business in a challenging business environment the companys writings in this class were subject to more relative variability than in some of its established andor stable lines of business although cumulative results through 2014 continue to be profitable for this book of business there was some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to older accident years   the adverse development on the 2008 outstanding reserves was primarily attributable to foreign exchange rate movements resulting in an increase in the us dollar reserves in addition the company experienced adverse development on liability exposures for subprime for accident years 20062008 and contractors liability exposures for accident years 20042005 the contractor liability exposures are currently in runoff the company also experienced adverse development on property lines but was offset by favorable development on other casualty lines   the companys loss and lae reserves represent managements best estimate of the ultimate liability while there can be no assurance that these reserves will not need to be increased in the future management believes that the companys existing reserves and reserving methodologies reduce the likelihood that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the companys

applicable the amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident years   since the company has operations in many countries part of the companys loss and lae reserves are in foreign currencies and translated to us dollars for each reporting period fluctuations in the exchange rates for the currencies period over

table was generally the result of the same factors described above that caused the deficiencies shown in the ten year gaap loss development table the unfavorable development experienced in the 2004 and prior accident years relate principally to the previously discussed asbestos development other business areas contributing to adverse development were casualty reinsurance including professional liability classes and workers compensation insurance where in retrospect the companys initial estimates of losses were underestimated principally as the result of unanticipated variability in the underlying exposures the favorable development for accident year 2005 relates primarily to favorable experience with respect to property reinsurance business in addition casualty reinsurance has reflected favorable development for accident years 2004 to 2006   the companys loss reserving methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of loss and loss development trends seeking on a timely basis to both adjust reserves for the impact of trend shifts and to factor the impact of such shifts into the companys underwriting and pricing on a prospective basis   the following table presents a

subsidiaries is responsible for establishing investment policy and guidelines and together with senior management for overseeing their execution   the companys principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet its insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize aftertax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio considering these objectives the company views its investment portfolio as having two components 1 the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities its core fixed maturities portfolio and 2 investments funded by the companys shareholders equity        17          for the portion needed to satisfy global outstanding liabilities the company generally invests in taxable and taxpreferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of a1 for the us portion of this portfolio our mix of taxable and taxpreferenced investments is adjusted periodically consistent with the companys current and projected us operating results market conditions and our tax position this global fixed maturity securities portfolio is externally managed by an independent professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by the company   over the past several years the company has expanded the allocation of its investments funded by shareholders equity to include 1 a greater percentage of publicly traded equity securities 2 emerging market fixed maturities through mutual fund structures as well as individual holdings 3 high yield fixed maturities 4 bank loan securities and 5 private equity limited partnership investments the objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the riskadjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes which are also less subject to changes in value with movements in interest rates the company limits its allocation to these asset classes because of 1 the potential for volatility in their values and 2 the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models the company uses investment managers experienced in these markets and adjusts its allocation to these investments based upon market conditions at december 31 2014 the market value of investments in these investment market sectors carried at both market and fair value approximated 59 of shareholders equity   the duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early prepayments the companys fixed income investment guidelines include a general duration guideline this investment duration guideline is established and periodically revised by management which considers economic and business factors as well as the companys average duration of potential liabilities which at december 31 2014 is estimated at approximately 39 years based on the estimated payouts of underwriting liabilities using standard duration calculations   the duration of the fixed income portfolio at december 31 2014 and 2013 was 29 years and 32 years respectively the company has shortened the duration of its portfolio in recent years in response to very low available yields particularly on securities with longer maturities as a result the company has focused on purchasing high quality shorter duration investments and investments with floating rate yields these investments will be less subject to decline in market value if interest rates rise in the future as forecasted by most investment analysts   for each currency in which the company has established substantial loss and lae reserves the company seeks to maintain invested assets denominated in such currency in an amount approximately equal to the estimated liabilities approximately 29 of the companys consolidated reserves for losses and lae and unearned premiums represent amounts payable in foreign currencies   the companys net investment income was 5306 million 5485 million and 6002 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the decrease from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to lower reinvestment rates for the fixed income portfolios and a decrease in our limited partnership income   the company had net realized capital gains for 2014 of 840 million in 2014 the company recorded 1217 million of gains due to fair value remeasurements on fixed maturity and equity securities and 19 million of net realized capital gains from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities partially offset by 395 million of otherthantemporary impairments on fixed maturity securities in 2013 net realized capital gains were 3002 million due to 2589 million of gains due to fair value remeasurements on fixed maturity and equity securities and 424 million of net realized capital gains from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities partially offset by 11 million of otherthantemporary impairments on fixed maturity securities in 2012 net realized capital gains were 1644 million due to 1181 million of gains due to fair value remeasurements on fixed maturity and equity securities and 563 million of net realized capital gains from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities partially offset by 100 million of otherthantemporary impairments on fixed maturity securities        18

policyholders and should not be considered an indication of the degree or lack of risk involved in a direct or indirect equity investment in an insurance or reinsurance company   all of the belowmentioned ratings are continually monitored and revised if necessary by each of the rating agencies the ratings presented in the following table were in effect as of february 27 2015   the company believes that its ratings are important as they provide the companys customers and its investors with an independent assessment of the companys financial strength using a rating scale that provides for relative comparisons strong financial ratings are particularly important for reinsurance companies ceding companies must rely on their reinsurers to pay covered losses well into the future as a result a highly rated reinsurer is generally preferred       operating subsidiary     am best     standard amp poors     moodys                   everest re     a superior     a strong

highly competitive as well as cyclical by product and market as such financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of constrained availability high rates and strong profits followed by periods of abundant capacity low rates and constrained profitability competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that we underwrite is based on many factors including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by am best andor standard amp poors underwriting expertise the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized capacity and coverages offered premiums charged other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered services offered speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written furthermore the market impact from these competitive factors related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels        22          the company competes in the us bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors the companys competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies domestic and international underwriting operations including underwriting syndicates at lloyds and certain government sponsored risk transfer vehicles some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company and have established long term and continuing business relationships which can be a significant competitive advantage in addition the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and recently the securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition   worldwide insurance and reinsurance market conditions continued to be very competitive particularly in the property catastrophe and casualty reinsurance lines of business generally there was ample insurance and reinsurance capacity relative to demand as well as additional capital from the capital markets through insurance linked financial instruments these financial instruments such as side cars catastrophe bonds and collateralized reinsurance funds provide capital markets with access to insurance and reinsurance risk exposure the capital markets demand for these products is being primarily driven by the current low interest environment and the desire to achieve greater risk diversification and potentially higher returns on their investments this increased competition is generally having a negative impact on rates terms and conditions however the impact varies widely by market and coverage   rates tend to fluctuate by specific region and products particularly areas recently impacted by large catastrophic events during the second and third quarters of 2013 canada experienced historic flooding in alberta and toronto which resulted in higher catastrophe rates in these areas during 2014 although there were flooding and wind storm events in europe and asia in the latter part of 2013 the overall 2013 catastrophe losses for the industry were lower than average this lower level of losses combined with increased competition resulted in downward pressure on rates in certain geographical areas during 2014 catastrophe results during 2014 were also generally benign which could have a negative impact on worldwide regional catastrophe markets during 2015   overall the company believes that given its size strong ratings distribution system reputation expertise and capital market vehicle activity the current marketplace conditions provide profit opportunities the company continues to employ its strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit potential while maintaining balance and diversification in its overall portfolio   employees as of february 1 2015 the company employed 1125 persons management believes that employee relations are good none of the companys employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements and the company is not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements   regulatory matters the company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance statutes of the various jurisdictions in which they conduct business including essentially all states of the us canada singapore brazil the united kingdom ireland and bermuda these regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are generally designed to protect ceding

insurance commissioners naic has developed a formula to measure the amount of capital appropriate for a property and casualty insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile the major categories of a companys risk profile are its asset risk credit risk and underwriting risk the standards are an effort by the naic to prevent insolvencies to ward off other financial difficulties of insurance companies and to establish uniform regulatory standards among state insurance departments   under the approved formula a companys statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital rbc if this ratio is above a minimum threshold no action is necessary below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which an insurers domiciliary state regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over an insurer as the ratio of surplus to rbc decreases the mildest intervention requires an insurer to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions the most severe action requires an insurer to be rehabilitated or liquidated   based on their financial positions at december 31 2014 everest re everest national everest indemnity and everest security significantly exceed the minimum thresholds since mt mckinley ceased writing new and renewal insurance in 1985 its domiciliary regulator the delaware insurance commissioner has

exchange commission the sec   item 1a risk factors   in addition to the other information provided in this report the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in our securities if the circumstances contemplated by the individual risk factors materialize our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly   risks relating to our business   fluctuations in the financial markets could result in investment losses   prolonged and severe disruptions in the overall public debt and equity markets such as occurred during 2008 could result in significant realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio although financial markets have significantly improved since 2008 they could deteriorate in the future there could also be disruption in individual market sectors such as occurred in the energy sector during the fourth quarter of 2014 such declines in the financial markets could result in significant realized and unrealized losses on investments and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations equity business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings   our results could be adversely affected by catastrophic events   we are exposed to unpredictable catastrophic events including weatherrelated and other natural catastrophes as well as acts of terrorism any material reduction in our operating results caused by the occurrence of one or more catastrophes could inhibit our ability to pay dividends or to meet our interest and principal payment obligations subsequent to april 1 2010 we define a catastrophe as an event that causes a loss on property exposures before reinsurance of at least 100 million before corporate level reinsurance and taxes prior to april 1 2010 we used a threshold of 50 million by way of illustration during the past five calendar years pretax catastrophe losses net of contract specific reinsurance but before cessions under corporate reinsurance programs were as follows       calendar year    pretax catastrophe losses     dollars in millions          2014     622     2013      1950     2012      4100     2011      13004     2010      5711         our losses from future catastrophic events could exceed our projections   we use projections of possible losses from future catastrophic events of varying types and magnitudes as a strategic underwriting tool we use these loss projections to estimate our potential catastrophe losses in certain geographic areas and decide on the placement of retrocessional coverage or other actions to limit the extent of potential losses in a given geographic area these loss projections are approximations reliant on a mix of quantitative and qualitative processes and actual losses may exceed the projections by a material amount resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations         27          if our loss reserves are inadequate to meet our actual losses our net income would be reduced or we could incur a loss   we are required to maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liability of losses and lae for both reported and unreported claims incurred these reserves are only estimates of what we believe the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances known to us in setting reserves for our reinsurance liabilities we rely on claim data supplied by our ceding companies and brokers and we employ actuarial and statistical projections the information received from our ceding companies is not always timely or accurate which can contribute to inaccuracies in our loss projections because of the uncertainties that surround our estimates of loss and lae reserves we cannot be certain that ultimate losses and lae payments will not exceed our estimates if our reserves are deficient we would be required to increase loss reserves in the period in which such deficiencies are identified which would cause a charge to our earnings and a reduction of capital by way of illustration during the past five calendar years the reserve reestimation process resulted in a decrease to our pretax net income in one of the years         calendar year    effect on pretax net income     dollars in millions              2014     399    increase      2013      182    increase      2012      37    increase      2011      37     decrease      2010      309    increase        see item 1 business  changes in historical reserves which provides a more detailed chart showing the effect of reserve reestimates on calendar year operating results for the past ten years   the difficulty in estimating our reserves is significantly more challenging as it relates to reserving for potential aampe liabilities at yearend 2014 49 of our gross reserves were comprised of aampe reserves aampe liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons including the long delays between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental contamination long reporting delays and difficulty in properly allocating liability for the asbestos or environmental damage legal tactics and judicial and legislative developments affecting the scope of insurers liability which can be difficult to predict also contribute to uncertainties in estimating reserves for aampe liabilities   the failure to accurately assess underwriting risk and establish adequate premium rates could reduce our net income or result in a net loss   our success depends on our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained if we fail to accurately assess the risks we retain we may fail to establish adequate premium rates to cover our losses and lae this could reduce our net income and even result in a net loss   in addition losses may arise from events or exposures that are not anticipated when the coverage is priced in addition to unanticipated events we also face the unanticipated expansion of our exposures particularly in longtail liability lines an example of this is the expansion over time of the scope of insurers legal liability within the mass tort arena particularly for aampe exposures discussed above   decreases in pricing for property and casualty reinsurance and insurance could reduce our net income   the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive as well as cyclical by product and market these cycles as well as other factors that influence aggregate supply and demand for property and casualty insurance and reinsurance products are outside of our control the supply of reinsurance is driven by prevailing prices and levels of capacity that may fluctuate in response to a number of factors including large catastrophic losses and investment returns being realized in the insurance industry demand for reinsurance is influenced by underwriting results of insurers and insureds including catastrophe losses and prevailing general economic conditions if any of these factors were to result in a decline in the demand for reinsurance or an overall increase in reinsurance capacity our net income could decrease        28          if rating agencies downgrade the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries future prospects for growth and profitability could be significantly and adversely affected   our active insurance company subsidiaries currently hold financial strength ratings assigned by thirdparty rating agencies which assess and rate the claims paying ability and financial strength of insurers and reinsurers our active subsidiaries carry an a superior rating from am best everest re bermuda re ireland re and everest national hold an a strong rating from standard amp poors everest re and bermuda re hold an a1 uppermedium grade rating from moodys financial strength ratings are used by client companies and agents and brokers that place the business as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers a downgrade or withdrawal of any of these ratings might adversely affect our ability to market our insurance products and could have a material and adverse effect on future prospects for growth and profitability   consistent with market practice much of our treaty reinsurance business allows the ceding company to terminate the contract or seek collateralization of our obligations in the event of a rating downgrade below a certain threshold the termination provision would generally be triggered if a rating fell below am bests a rating level which is three levels below everest res current rating of a to a lesser extent everest re also has modest exposure to reinsurance contracts that contain provisions for obligatory funding of outstanding liabilities in the event of a rating agency downgrade those provisions would also generally be triggered if everest res rating fell below am bests a rating level   the failure of our insureds intermediaries and reinsurers to satisfy their obligations to us could reduce our income   in accordance with industry practice we have uncollateralized receivables from insureds agents and brokers andor rely on agents and brokers to process our payments we may not be able to collect amounts due from insureds agents and brokers resulting in a reduction to net income   we are subject to credit risk of reinsurers in connection with retrocessional arrangements because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve us of our liability to the insured in addition reinsurers may be unwilling to pay us even though they are able to do so the failure of one or more of our reinsurers to honor their obligations to us in a timely fashion would impact our cash flow and reduce our net income and could cause us to incur a significant loss   if we are unable or choose not to purchase reinsurance and transfer risk to reinsurers our net income could be reduced or we could incur a net loss in the event of unusual loss experience   we are generally less reliant on the purchase of reinsurance than many of our competitors in part because of our strategic emphasis on underwriting discipline and management of the cycles inherent in our business we try to separate our risk taking process from our risk mitigation process in order to avoid developing too great a reliance on reinsurance historically we generally purchased reinsurance from other third parties only when we expect a net benefit with the expansion of the capital markets into insurance linked financial instruments we increased our use of capital market products for catastrophe reinsurance during 2014 in addition some of our quota share contracts with larger retrocessions were increased during 2014 the percentage of business that we reinsure may vary considerably from year to year depending on our view of the relationship between cost and expected benefit for the contract period         2014   2013   2012   2011   2010    percentage of ceded written premiums to gross written premiums   86    41    53    41    61         because we have purchased minimal reinsurance in recent years our net income could be reduced following a large unreinsured event or adverse overall claims experience        29          our industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future   our industry is highly competitive and subject to pricing cycles that can be pronounced we compete globally in the united states bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous competitors our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations including underwriting syndicates at lloyds   according to standard amp poors we rank among the top ten global reinsurance groups where more than twothirds of the market share is concentrated the worldwide net premium written by the top 40 global reinsurance groups for both life and nonlife business was estimated to be 202 billion in 2013 according to data compiled by standard amp poors the leaders in this market are munich re swiss re hannover rueckversicherung ag berkshire hathaway re scor se and syndicates at lloyds some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry which can be a significant competitive advantage in addition the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the entry of alternative capital market products and vehicles provide additional sources of reinsurance and insurance capacity and increased competition   we are dependent on our key personnel   our success has been and will continue to be dependent on our ability to retain the services of our chairman joseph v taranto age 65 and existing key executive officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future the loss of the services of any key executive officer or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct business generally we consider key executive officers to be those individuals who have the greatest influence in setting overall policy and controlling operations president and chief executive officer dominic j addesso age 61 executive vice president and chief financial officer craig howie age 51 executive vice president and chief underwriting officer john p doucette age 49 and executive vice president general counsel chief compliance officer and secretary sanjoy mukherjee age 48 we currently have an agreement with mr taranto to serve as a nonemployee director and chairman of the board through december 31 2016 subject to mr tarantos annual election to the board by its shareholders during its annual general meetings that occur over the term of the agreement we have employment contracts with mr addesso mr doucette and mr mukherjee which have been filed with the sec and provide for terms of employment ending on december 31 2016 for mr addesso and september 1 2016 for mr doucette and mr mukherjee   special considerations apply to our bermuda operations under bermuda law nonbermudians other than spouses of bermudians and individuals holding permanent or working resident certificates are not permitted to engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without a work permit issued by the bermuda government a work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show that after a proper public advertisement no bermudian spouse of a bermudian or individual holding a permanent or working resident certificate is available who meets the minimum standards reasonably required for the position the bermuda government places a sixyear term limit on individuals with work permits subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be key employees of businesses with a significant physical presence in bermuda currently all our bermudabased professional employees who require work permits have been granted permits by the bermuda government that expire at various times between august 2016 and february 2017 this includes mark de saram the chief executive officer of our bermuda reinsurance operation in the event his work permit were not renewed we could lose his services thereby adversely affecting our ability to conduct our business in bermuda until we were able to replace him with an individual in bermuda who did not require a work permit or who was granted the permit the company has an employment contract with mr de saram which was filed with the sec and provides for term of employment ending on june 30 2016        30          our investment values and investment income could decline because they are exposed to interest rate credit and market risks   a significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and smaller portions consist of equity securities and other investments both the fair market value of our invested assets and associated investment income fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions for example the fair market value of our predominant fixed income portfolio generally increases or decreases inversely to fluctuations in interest rates the market value of our fixed income securities could also decrease as a result of a downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of such securities to deteriorate the net investment income that we realize from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates   interest rate fluctuations also can cause net investment income from fixed income investments that carry prepayment risk such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities to differ from the income anticipated from those securities at the time of purchase in addition if issuers of individual investments are unable to meet their obligations investment income will be reduced and realized capital losses may arise   the majority of our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale and temporary changes in the market value of these investments are reflected as changes to our shareholders equity our actively managed equity security portfolios are fair valued and any changes in fair value are reflected as net realized capital gains or losses as a result a decline in the value of our securities reduces our capital or could cause us to incur a loss   we have invested a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities the value of these assets fluctuates with changes in the markets in times of economic weakness the fair value of these assets may decline and may negatively impact net income we also invest in nontraditional investments which have different risk characteristics than traditional fixed income and equity securities these alternative investments are comprised primarily of private equity limited partnerships the changes in value and investment incomeloss for these partnerships may be more volatile than overthecounter securities   the following table quantifies the portion of our investment portfolio that consists of fixed income securities equity securities and investments that carry prepayment risk           at            dollars in millions     december 31 2014        of

foreign currency exchange losses that reduce our net income and capital levels   through our bermuda and international operations we conduct business in a variety of foreign nonus currencies principally the euro the british pound the canadian dollar and the singapore dollar assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates our reporting currency is the us dollar and exchange rate fluctuations especially relative to the us dollar may materially impact our results and financial position in 2014 we wrote approximately 284 of our coverages in nonus currencies as of december 31 2014 we maintained approximately 141 of our investment portfolio in investments denominated in nonus currencies during 2014 2013 and 2012 the impact on our quarterly pretax net income from exchange rate fluctuations ranged from a loss of 130 million to a gain of 318 million   we are subject to cybersecurity risks that could negatively impact our business operations   we are dependent upon our information technology platform including our processing systems data and electronic transmissions in our business operations security breaches could expose us to the loss or misuse of our information litigation and potential liability in addition cyber incidents that impact the availability reliability speed accuracy or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant negative impact on our operations and possibly our results an incident could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws damage our reputation cause a loss of customers or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties which could be significant management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our operations   risks relating to regulation   insurance laws and regulations restrict our ability to operate and any failure to comply with those laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business   we are subject to extensive and increasing regulation under us state and foreign insurance laws these laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to us by our operating subsidiaries impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that we can hold prescribe solvency accounting and internal control standards that must be met and maintained and require us to maintain reserves these laws also require disclosure of material interaffiliate transactions and require prior approval of extraordinary transactions such extraordinary transactions include declaring dividends from operating subsidiaries that exceed statutory thresholds these laws also generally require approval of changes of control of insurance companies the application of these laws could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends interest and other payments on securities as applicable and could restrict our ability to expand our business operations through acquisitions of new insurance subsidiaries we may not have or maintain all required licenses and approvals or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us these types of actions could have a material adverse effect on our business to date no material fine penalty or restriction has been imposed on us for failure to comply with any insurance law or regulation    as a result of the recent dislocation of the financial markets congress and the presidential administration in the united states are implementing changes in the way the financial services industry is regulated some of these changes are also impacting the insurance industry for example the united states department of treasury has recently established the federal insurance office with the authority to monitor all aspects of the insurance sector monitor the extent to which traditionally underserved communities and consumers have access to affordable nonhealth insurance products to represent the united states on prudential aspects of international insurance matters to assist with administration of the terrorism risk insurance program and to advise on important national and international insurance matters in addition regulatory bodies in europe are developing a new capital adequacy directive for insurers and reinsurers the future impact of such initiatives if any on our operation net income loss or financial condition cannot be determined at this time         32          regulatory challenges in the united states could adversely affect the ability of bermuda re to conduct business   bermuda re does not intend to be licensed or admitted as an insurer or reinsurer in any us jurisdiction under current law bermuda re generally will be permitted to reinsure us risks from its office in bermuda without obtaining those licenses however the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework is subject to periodic legislative review and revision in the past there have been congressional and other initiatives in the united states regarding increased supervision and regulation of the insurance industry including proposals to supervise and regulate reinsurers domiciled outside the united states if bermuda re were to become subject to any insurance laws of the united states or any us state at any time in the future it might be required to post deposits or maintain minimum surplus levels and might be prohibited from engaging in lines of business or from writing some types of policies complying with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business in bermuda and international markets   bermuda re may need to be licensed or admitted in additional jurisdictions to develop its business   as bermuda res business develops it will monitor the need to obtain licenses in jurisdictions other than bermuda and the uk where it has an authorized branch in order to comply with applicable law or to be able to engage in additional insurancerelated activities in addition bermuda re may be at a competitive disadvantage in jurisdictions where it is not licensed or does not enjoy an exemption from licensing relative to competitors that are so licensed or exempt from licensing bermuda re may not be able to obtain any additional licenses that it determines are necessary or desirable furthermore the process of obtaining those licenses is often costly and may take a long time   bermuda res ability to write reinsurance may be severely limited if it is unable to arrange for security to back its reinsurance   many jurisdictions do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or nonadmitted insurers on their statutory financial statements without appropriate security bermuda res reinsurance clients typically require it to post a letter of credit or enter into other security arrangements if bermuda re is unable to obtain or maintain a letter of credit facility on commercially acceptable terms or is unable to arrange for other types of security its ability to operate its business may be severely limited if bermuda re defaults on any letter of credit that it obtains it may be required to prematurely liquidate a substantial portion of its investment portfolio and other assets pledged as collateral   risks relating to groups securities   because of our holding company structure our ability to pay dividends interest and principal is dependent on our receipt of dividends loan payments and other funds from our subsidiaries   group and holdings are holding companies each of whose most significant asset consists of the stock of its operating subsidiaries as a result each of groups and holdings ability to pay dividends interest or other payments on its securities in the future will depend on the earnings and cash flows of the operating subsidiaries and the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to it this ability is subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors beyond our control payment of dividends and advances and repayments from some of the operating subsidiaries are regulated by us state and foreign insurance laws and regulatory restrictions including minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds accordingly the operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to group and holdings in the future which could prevent us from paying dividends interest or other payments on our securities        33          provisions in groups byelaws could have an antitakeover effect which could diminish the value of its common shares   groups byelaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable the effect of these provisions could be to prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future   for example groups byelaws contain the following provisions that could have an antitakeover effect           the total voting power of any shareholder owning more than 99 of the common shares will be reduced to 99 of the total voting power of the common shares              the board of directors may decline to register any transfer of common shares if it has reason to believe that the transfer would result in          i    any person that is not an investment company beneficially owning more than 50 of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group          ii    any person holding controlled shares in excess of 99 of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group or          iii    any adverse tax regulatory or legal consequences to group any of its subsidiaries or any of its shareholders              group also has the option to redeem or purchase all or part of a shareholders common shares to the extent the board of directors determines it is necessary or advisable to avoid or cure any adverse or potential adverse consequences if          i    any person that is not an investment company beneficially owns more than 50 of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group                   ii    any person holds controlled shares in excess of 99 of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group or                   iii    share ownership by any person may result in adverse tax regulatory or legal consequences to group any of its subsidiaries or any other shareholder      the board of directors has indicated that it will apply these byelaw provisions in such manner that passive institutional investors will be treated similarly to investment companies for this purpose passive institutional investors include all persons who are eligible pursuant to rule 13d1b1 under the us securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act to file a shortform statement on schedule 13g other than an insurance company or any parent holding company or control person of an insurance company   applicable insurance laws may also have an antitakeover effect   before a person can acquire control of a us insurance company prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where that insurance company is domiciled or deemed commercially domiciled prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurance company a state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant the integrity and competence of the applicants board of directors and executive officers the acquirors plans for the future operations of the insurance company and any anticompetitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control because any person who acquired control of group would thereby acquire indirect control of its insurance company subsidiaries in the us the insurance change of control laws of delaware california and georgia would apply to such a transaction this could have the effect of delaying or even preventing such a change of control        34          the ownership of common shares of group by holdings may have an impact on securing approval of shareholder proposals that groups management supports   as of december 31 2014 holdings owned 9719971 or 179 of the outstanding common shares of group under groups byelaws the total voting power of any shareholder owning more than 99 of the common shares is reduced to 99 of the total voting power of the common shares nevertheless holdings which is controlled by group has the ability to vote 99 of the total voting power of groups common shares   investors in group may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than investors in a us corporation   the companies act 1981 of bermuda the companies act differs in material respects from the laws applicable to us corporations and their shareholders the following is a summary of material differences between the companies act as modified in some instances by provisions of groups byelaws and delaware corporate law that could make it more difficult for investors in group to protect their interests than investors in a us corporation because the following statements are summaries they do not address all aspects of bermuda law that may be relevant to group and its shareholders   alternate directors groups byelaws provide as permitted by bermuda law that each director may appoint an alternate director who shall have the power to attend and vote at any meeting of the board of directors or committee at which that director is not personally present and to sign written consents in place of that director delaware law permits a director to appoint another director as an alternate to attend any board committee meeting however delaware law does not provide for the designation of alternate directors with authority to attend or vote at a meeting of the board of directors   committees of the board of directors groups byelaws provide as permitted by bermuda law that the board of directors may delegate any of its powers to committees that the board appoints and those committees may consist partly or entirely of nondirectors delaware law allows the board of directors of a corporation to delegate many of its powers to committees but those committees may consist only of directors   interested directors bermuda law and groups byelaws provide that if a director has a personal interest in a transaction to which the company is also a party and if the director discloses the nature of this personal interest at the first opportunity either at a meeting of directors or in writing to the directors then the company will not be able to declare the transaction void solely due to the existence of that personal interest and the director will not be liable to the company for any profit realized from the transaction in addition after a director has made the declaration of interest referred to above he or she is allowed to be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which he or she has an interest unless disqualified from doing so by the chairman of the relevant board meeting under delaware law an interested director could be held liable for a transaction in which that director derived an improper personal benefit additionally under delaware law a corporation may be able to declare a transaction with an interested director to be void unless one of the following conditions is fulfilled           the material facts as to the interested directors relationship or interests are disclosed or are known to the board of directors and the board in good faith authorizes the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors              the material facts are disclosed or are known to the shareholders entitled to vote on the transaction and the transaction is specifically approved in good faith by the holders of a majority of the voting shares or              the transaction is fair to the corporation as of the time it is authorized approved or ratified           35          transactions with significant shareholders as a bermuda company group may enter into business transactions with its significant shareholders including asset sales in which a significant shareholder receives or could receive a financial benefit that is greater than that received or to be received by other shareholders with prior approval from groups board of directors but without obtaining prior approval from the shareholders in the case of an amalgamation in which two or more companies join together and continue as a single company a resolution of shareholders approved by a majority of at least 75 of the votes cast is required in addition to the approval of the board of directors except in the case of an amalgamation with and between whollyowned subsidiaries if group was a delaware corporation any business combination with an interested shareholder which for this purpose would include mergers and asset sales of greater than 10 of groups assets that would otherwise be considered transactions in the ordinary course of business within a period of three years from the time the person became an interested shareholder would require prior approval from shareholders holding at least 66 23 of groups outstanding common shares not owned by the interested shareholder unless the transaction qualified for one of the exemptions in the relevant delaware statute or group opted out of the statute for purposes of the delaware statute an interested shareholder is generally defined as a person who together with that persons affiliates and associates owns or within the previous three years did own 15 or more of a corporations outstanding voting shares   takeovers under bermuda law if an acquiror makes an offer for shares of a company and within four months of the offer the holders of not less than 90 of the shares that are the subject of the offer tender their shares the acquiror may give the nontendering shareholders notice requiring them to transfer their shares on the terms of the offer within one month of receiving the notice dissenting shareholders may apply to the court objecting to the transfer the burden is on the dissenting shareholders to show that the court should exercise its discretion to enjoin the transfer the court will be unlikely to do this unless there is evidence of fraud or bad faith or collusion between the acquiror and the tendering shareholders aimed at unfairly forcing out minority shareholders under another provision of bermuda law the holders of 95 of the shares of a company the acquiring shareholders may give notice to the remaining shareholders requiring them to sell their shares on the terms described in the notice within one month of receiving the notice dissenting shareholders may apply to the court for an appraisal of their shares within one month of the courts appraisal the acquiring shareholders are entitled either to acquire all shares involved at the price fixed by the court or cancel the notice given to the remaining shareholders if shares were acquired under the notice at a price below the courts appraisal price the acquiring shareholders must either pay the difference in price or cancel the notice and return the shares thus acquired to the shareholder who must then refund the purchase price there are no comparable provisions under delaware law   inspection of corporate records members of the general public have the right to inspect the public documents of group available at the office of the registrar of companies and groups registered office both in bermuda these documents include the memorandum of association which describes groups permitted purposes and powers any amendments to the memorandum of association and documents relating to any increase or reduction in groups authorized share capital shareholders of group have the additional right to inspect groups byelaws minutes of general meetings of shareholders and audited financial statements that must be presented to the annual general meeting of shareholders the register of shareholders of group also is open to inspection by shareholders and to members of the public without charge group is required to maintain its share register at its registered office in bermuda group also maintains a branch register in the offices of its transfer agent in the us which is open for public inspection as required under the companies act group is required to keep at its registered office a register of its directors and officers that is open for inspection by members of the public without charge however bermuda law does not provide a general right for shareholders to inspect or obtain copies of any other corporate records under delaware law any shareholder may inspect or obtain copies of a corporations shareholder list and its other books and records for any purpose reasonably related to that persons interest as a shareholder   shareholders suits the rights of shareholders under bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders under legislation or judicial precedent in many us jurisdictions class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda however the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent which would permit a shareholder to bring an action in the name of group to remedy a wrong done to group where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of group or illegal or would result in the violation of groups memorandum of association or byelaws furthermore the court would give consideration to acts that are          36           alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of groups shareholders than actually approved it the winning party in an action of this type generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action under delaware law class actions and derivative actions generally are available to stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty corporate waste and actions not taken in accordance with applicable law in these types of actions the court has discretion to permit the winning party to recover its attorneys fees   limitation of liability of directors and officers groups byelaws provide that group and its shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have individually or in the right of the company against any director or officer for any act or failure to act in the performance of that directors or officers duties however this waiver does not apply to claims or rights of action that arise out of fraud or dishonesty this waiver may have the effect of barring claims arising under us federal securities laws under delaware law a corporation may include in its certificate of incorporation provisions limiting the personal liability of its directors to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for many types of breach of fiduciary duty however these provisions may not limit liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law the authorization of unlawful dividends stock repurchases or stock redemptions or any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit moreover delaware provisions would not be likely to bar claims arising under us federal securities laws   indemnification of directors and officers groups byelaws provide that group shall indemnify its directors or officers to the full extent permitted by law against all actions costs charges liabilities loss damage or expense incurred or suffered by them by reason of any act done concurred in or omitted in the conduct of groups business or in the discharge of their duties under bermuda law this indemnification may not extend to any matter involving fraud or dishonesty of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the company as determined in a final judgment or decree not subject to appeal under delaware law a corporation may indemnify a director or officer who becomes a party to an action suit or proceeding because of his position as a director or officer if 1 the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and 2 if the action or proceeding involves a criminal offense the director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful   enforcement of civil liabilities group is organized under the laws of bermuda some of its directors and officers may reside outside the us a substantial portion of our assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the us as a result a person may not be able to affect service of process within the us on directors and officers of group and those experts who reside outside the us a person also may not be able to recover against them or group on judgments of us courts or to obtain original judgments against them or group in bermuda courts including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws   dividends bermuda law does not allow a company to declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company after the payment is made would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or that the realizable value of the companys assets would be less as a result of the payment than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts the share capital account represents the aggregate par value of issued shares and the share premium account represents the aggregate amount paid for issued shares over and above their par value under delaware law subject to any restrictions contained in a companys certificate of incorporation a company may pay dividends out of the surplus or if there is no surplus out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year surplus is the amount by which the net assets of a corporation exceed its stated capital delaware law also provides that dividends may not be paid out of net profits at any time when stated capital is less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets        37          risks relating to taxation   if us tax law changes our net income may be reduced   for several years now some members of congress have expressed concern about us corporations that move their place of incorporation to lowtax jurisdictions also some members of congress have expressed concern over a competitive advantage that foreigncontrolled insurers and reinsurers may have over us controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the purchase of reinsurance by us insurers from affiliates operating in some foreign jurisdictions including bermuda it is possible that future legislation that would be disadvantageous to our bermuda insurance subsidiaries could be enacted if any such legislation were enacted the us tax burden on our bermuda operations or on some business ceded from our licensed us insurance subsidiaries to our nonus insurance subsidiaries could be increased this would reduce our net income   group andor bermuda re may be subject to us corporate income tax which would reduce our net income   bermuda re the income of bermuda re is a significant portion of our worldwide income from operations we have established guidelines for the conduct of our operations that are designed to ensure that bermuda re is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the us based on its compliance with those guidelines we believe that bermuda re should not be required to pay us corporate income tax other than withholding tax on us source dividend income however if the internal revenue service irs were to successfully assert that bermuda re was engaged in a trade or business bermuda re would be required to pay us corporate income tax on all of its income and possibly the us branch profits tax however if the irs were to successfully assert that bermuda re was engaged in a us trade or business we believe the usbermuda tax treaty would preclude the irs from taxing bermuda res income except to the extent that its income was attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by that subsidiary we do not believe that bermuda re has a permanent establishment in the us if the irs were to successfully assert that bermuda re did have income attributable to a permanent establishment in the us bermuda re would be subject to us tax only on that income this would reduce our net income   group  we conduct our operations in a manner designed to minimize our us tax exposures  based on our compliance with guidelines designed to ensure that we generate only immaterial amounts if any of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us we believe that we should be required to pay only immaterial amounts if any of us corporate income tax other than withholding tax on us source dividend income however if the irs successfully asserted that we had material amounts of income that was subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us we would be required to pay us corporate income tax on that income and possibly the us branch profits tax the imposition of such tax would reduce our net income   if bermuda re became subject to us income tax on its income or if we became subject to us income tax our income could also be subject to the us branch profits tax in that event group and bermuda re would be subject to taxation at a higher combined effective rate than if they were organized as us corporations the combined effect of the 35 us corporate income tax rate and the 30 branch profits tax rate is a net tax rate of 545 the imposition of these taxes would reduce our net income   group andor bermuda re may become subject to bermuda tax which would reduce our net income   group and bermuda re are not subject to income or profits tax withholding tax or capital gains taxes in bermuda both companies have received an assurance from the bermuda minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection amendment act of 2011 to the effect that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that imposes any tax computed on profits or income or computed on any capital asset gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax then that tax will not apply to us or to any of our operations or our shares debentures or other obligations until march 31 2035 this assurance does not prevent the application of any of those taxes to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda and does not prevent the imposition of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the land tax act 1967 of bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to any land leased to group or bermuda re        38          our net income will be reduced if us excise and withholding taxes are increased   bermuda re is subject to federal excise tax on reinsurance and insurance premiums with respect to risks located in the us in addition bermuda re is subject to withholding tax on dividend income from us sources these taxes could increase and other taxes could be imposed in the future on bermuda res business which would reduce our net income   item 1b unresolved staff comments   none   item 2 properties   everest res corporate offices are

resolution procedures the outcomes of which will determine the companys rights and obligations under insurance and reinsurance agreements in some disputes the company seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or to collect funds owing to it in other matters the company is resisting attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged rights these disputes arise from time to time and are ultimately resolved through both informal and formal means including negotiated resolution arbitration and litigation in all such matters the company believes that its positions are legally and commercially reasonable the company considers the statuses of these proceedings when determining its reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses   aside from litigation and arbitrations

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation   the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto presented under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data   industry conditions the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive as well as cyclical by product and market as such financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of constrained availability high rates and strong profits followed by periods of abundant capacity low rates and constrained profitability competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that we underwrite is based on many factors including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by am best andor standard amp poors underwriting expertise the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized capacity and coverages offered premiums charged other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered services offered speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written furthermore the market impact from these competitive factors related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels   we compete in the us bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies domestic and international underwriting operations including underwriting syndicates at lloyds and certain government sponsored risk transfer vehicles some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have established long term and continuing business relationships which can be a significant competitive advantage in addition the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and recently the securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition   worldwide insurance and reinsurance market conditions continued to be very competitive particularly in the property catastrophe and casualty reinsurance lines of business generally there was ample insurance and reinsurance capacity relative to demand as well as additional capital from the capital markets through insurance linked financial instruments these financial instruments such as side cars catastrophe bonds and collateralized reinsurance funds provide capital markets with access to insurance and reinsurance risk exposure the capital markets demand for these products is being primarily driven by the current low interest environment and the desire to achieve greater risk diversification and potentially higher returns on their investments this increased competition is generally having a negative impact on rates terms and conditions however the impact varies widely by market and coverage   rates tend to fluctuate by specific region and products particularly areas recently impacted by large catastrophic events during the second and third quarters of 2013 canada experienced historic flooding in alberta and toronto which resulted in higher catastrophe rates in these areas during 2014 although there were flooding and wind storm events in europe and asia in the latter part of 2013 the overall 2013 catastrophe losses for the industry were lower than average this lower level of losses combined with increased competition resulted in downward pressure on rates in certain geographical areas during 2014 catastrophe results

   revenues premiums gross written premiums increased by 102 to 57490 million in 2014 compared to 52186 million in 2013 reflecting a 4625 million or 118 increase in our reinsurance business and a 1182 million increase from the mt logan re segment which commenced operations in the third quarter of 2013 partially offset by a 504 million or 40 decrease in our insurance business the increase in reinsurance premiums was mainly due to new business quota share contracts and contracts with catastrophe exposed risks partially offset by a negative impact of 521 million from the movement in foreign exchange rates the decrease in insurance premiums was primarily due to lower crop premiums partially offset by an increase in nonstandard auto business net written premiums increased by 50 to 52569 million in 2014 compared to 50048 million in 2013 the variance between the increase in gross written premiums        44          compared to the increase in net written premiums is primarily due to a higher utilization of reinsurance related to the new quota share contracts premiums earned increased by 87 to 51691 million in 2014 compared to 47535 million in 2013 the change in premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of the coverage period   gross written premiums increased by 211 to 52186 million in 2013 compared to 43105 million in 2012 reflecting a 6923 million or 214 increase in our reinsurance business a 1956 million or 182 increase in our insurance business and 202 million from our new mt logan re segment the increase in reinsurance premiums was mainly due to the impact of a florida quota share reinsurance contract as well as new business increased participations on existing business and higher original rates on subject business excluding the year over year impact of the large florida quota share reinsurance contract gross written premiums increased 150 and reinsurance premiums increased 134 compared to the prior year the increase in insurance premiums was primarily due to the growth in california workers compensation crop and nonstandard auto business net written premiums increased by 226 to 50048 million in 2013 compared to 40811 million in 2012 which is consistent with the increase in gross written premiums premiums earned increased by 141 to 47535 million in 2013 compared to 41646 million in 2012 unlike written premiums premiums earned were minimally impacted by the florida quota share reinsurance contract the change in premiums earned was comparable to net written premiums excluding the impact of the florida quota share reinsurance contract   net investment income net investment income decreased by 33 to 5306 million in 2014 compared with net investment income of 5485 million in 2013 net pretax investment income as a percentage of average invested assets was 32 in 2014 compared to 35 in 2013 the decline in income and yield in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of lower reinvestment rates for the fixed income portfolios and a decrease in our limited partnership income   net investment income decreased by 86 to 5485 million in 2013 compared with net investment income of 6002 million in 2012 net pretax investment income as a percentage of average invested assets was 35 in 2013 compared to 39 in 2012 the decline in income and yield was primarily the result of lower reinvestment rates for the fixed income portfolios less dividend income from equity investments and a decrease in our limited partnership income   net realized capital gains losses net realized capital gains were 840 million 3002 million and 1644 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the 840 million was comprised of 1217 million of net gains from fair value remeasurements and 19 million of net realized capital gains from sales on our fixed maturity and equity securities which were partially offset by 395 million of otherthantemporary impairments the net realized capital gains of 3002 million in 2013 were the result of 2589 million of gains from fair value remeasurements and 424 million of net realized capital gains from sales on our fixed maturity and equity securities which were partially offset by 11 million of otherthantemporary impairments the net realized capital gains of 1644 million in 2012 were the result of 1181 million of gains from fair value remeasurements and 563 million of net realized capital gains from sales on our fixed maturity and equity securities which were partially offset by 100 million of otherthantemporary impairments   net derivative gain loss in 2005 and prior we sold seven equity index put option contracts which remain outstanding these contracts meet the definition of a derivative in accordance with fasb guidance and as such are fair valued each quarter with the change recorded as net derivative gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss as a result of these adjustments in value we recognized net derivative losses of 116 million in 2014 net derivative gains of 440 million in 2013 and net derivative losses of 97 million in 2012 the change in the fair value of these equity index put option contracts is indicative of the change in the equity markets and interest rates over the same periods   other income expense we recorded other income of 184 million in 2014 other expense of 55 million in 2013 and other income of 33 million in 2012 the changes were primarily the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the corresponding periods         45          claims and expenses incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses the following

compared to 28003 million for the year ended december 31 2013 primarily due to increases in current year attritional losses partially offset by a reduction in current year catastrophe losses the increase in current year attritional losses of 2329 million is primarily due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned the 121 million of favorable prior years development for 2014 is a combination of 1747 million of favorable development in the reinsurance segments related primarily to treaty casualty and treaty property reserves partially offset by 1378 million of development on

and european floods 200 million   incurred losses and lae increased by 20 to 28003 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 27453 million for the year ended december 31 2012 primarily due to increases in current year attritional losses partially offset by the decline in current year catastrophe losses for 2013 outlined above the increase in current year attritional losses of 2846 million is primarily due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned despite the increase in current year attritional losses the current year attritional loss ratio decreased by 10 points due to the shift in the mix of business towards excess of loss business which generally results in lower loss ratios the 4100 million of current year catastrophe losses for 2012 represented 98 points and related to superstorm sandy 3250 million us storms 600 million and hurricane isaac 250 million        46          commission brokerage taxes and fees commission brokerage taxes and fees increased by 162 to 11356 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 9776 million for the year ended december 31 2013 these changes were primarily due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned changes in the mix of business and higher contingent commissions   commission brokerage taxes and fees increased by 26 to 9776 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 9527 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the year over year changes were primarily due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned partially offset by an increase in excess of loss business in 2013 which carries a lower commission rate than pro rata business   other underwriting expenses other underwriting expenses were 2404 million 2371 million and 2077 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in other underwriting expenses for 2014 compared to 2013 was mainly due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned the increase in other underwriting expenses for 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly due to the impact of higher premiums earned and higher compensation expenses   corporate expenses corporate expenses which are general operating expenses that are not allocated to segments were comparable at 234 million 248 million and 240 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively   interest fees and bond issue cost amortization expense interest fees and other bond amortization expense was 385 million and 461 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively the decrease was primarily due to the redemption of 3299 million of trust preferred securities in may 2013 and the maturity of 2500 million of senior notes on october 15 2014 partially offset by the impact of the issuance of 4000 million of senior notes in june 2014   interest fees and other bond amortization expense was 461 million and 537 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively the decrease was primarily due to the redemption of 3299 million of trust preferred securities in may 2013 the year over year decrease was partially offset by 77 million of amortization expense on remaining capitalized issuance costs related to the redeemed securities   income tax expense benefit we had income tax expenses of 1877 million 2897 million and 1106 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively income tax expense is primarily a function of the geographic location of the companys pretax income and the statutory tax rates in those jurisdictions as affected by taxexempt investment income and as calculated under the annualized effective tax rate aetr method variations in the aetr generally result from changes in the relative levels of pretax income including the impact of catastrophe losses and net capital gains losses among jurisdictions with different tax rates the decrease in income tax expense for 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to lower net realized capital gains in the us and the realization of additional foreign tax credits   net income loss our net income was 12585 million 12653 million and 8290 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the changes were primarily driven by the financial component fluctuations explained above   net income loss attributable to everest re group our net income attributable to everest re group was 11992 million 12594 million and 8290 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the changes were primarily driven by the financial component fluctuations described above as well as the impact of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2014 and 2013        47          ratios our combined ratio decreased by 17 points to 828 in 2014 compared to 845 in 2013 the loss ratio component decreased 27 points in 2014 over the same period last year primarily due to the 1050 million decrease in current year catastrophe losses which lowered the loss ratio by 24 points the commission and brokerage ratio components increased 14 points in 2014 primarily due to changes in the mix of business and higher contingent commissions the other underwriting expense ratio components decreased by 04 points in 2014 over the same period last year primarily due to higher premiums earned   our combined ratio decreased by 93 points to 845 in 2013 compared to 938 in 2012 the loss ratio component decreased 70 points in 2013 over the same period last year primarily due to the 2150 million decrease in current year catastrophe losses which lowered the loss ratio by 57 points the commission and brokerage ratio components decreased 23 points in 2013 due to the one time impact of the termination of the florida quota share contract in 2012 and the increase in excess of loss business which carries a lower commission than pro rata business the other underwriting expense ratio components remained flat in 2013 over the same period in 2012   shareholders equity   shareholders equity increased by 4828 million to 74511 million at december 31 2014 from 69683 million at december 31 2013 principally as a result of 11992 million of net income

  net investment income net investment income decreased by 33 to 5306 million in 2014 compared to 5485 million in 2013 primarily due to a decline in income from our fixed maturities reflective of lower reinvestment rates and a decline in income from our limited partnership investments   net investment income decreased by 86 to 5485 million in 2013 compared to 6002 million in 2012 primarily due

despite the increase in current year attritional losses the current year attritional loss ratio decreased 32 points due to the continued shift in business to excess of loss contracts which generally

mainly due to increases in current year attritional losses and higher unfavorable prior year development on attritional losses in 2013 compared to 2012 the current year attritional losses increased by 1585 million primarily due to the impact of higher premiums earned and a higher current year attritional loss ratio on the crop book which was impacted by a decline in corn commodity prices and lower yields in several of our key states the prior year development on attritional losses was primarily related to workers compensation construction liability and umbrella business the construction

accounting policies related to accounting estimates that 1 require management to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters and 2 could materially impact the consolidated financial statements if management made different assumptions   loss and lae reserves our most critical accounting policy is the determination of our loss and lae reserves we maintain reserves equal to our estimated ultimate liability for losses and lae for reported and unreported claims for our insurance and reinsurance businesses because reserves are based on estimates of ultimate losses and lae by underwriting or accident year we use a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to monitor reserve adequacy over time evaluate new information as it becomes known and adjust reserves whenever an adjustment appears warranted we consider many factors when setting reserves including 1 our exposure base and projected ultimate premiums earned 2 our expected loss ratios by product and class of business which are developed collaboratively by underwriters and actuaries 3 actuarial methodologies which analyze our loss reporting and payment experience reports from ceding companies and historical trends such as reserving patterns loss payments and product mix 4 current legal interpretations of coverage and liability 5 economic conditions and 6 uncertainties discussed below regarding our liability for aampe claims our insurance and reinsurance loss and lae reserves represent our        61          best estimate of our ultimate liability actual losses and lae ultimately paid may deviate perhaps substantially from such reserves our net income loss will be impacted in a period in which the change in estimated ultimate losses and lae is recorded see also item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements   it is more difficult to accurately estimate loss reserves for reinsurance liabilities than for insurance liabilities at december 31 2014 we had reinsurance reserves of 72993 million and insurance loss reserves of 24215 million of which 3688 million and 1074 million respectively were loss reserves for aampe liabilities a detailed discussion of additional considerations related to aampe exposures follows later in this section   the detailed data required to evaluate ultimate losses for our insurance business is accumulated from our underwriting and claim systems reserving for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from ceding companies ceding companies report losses to us in many forms dependent on the type of contract and the agreed or contractual reporting requirements generally proportionalquota share contracts require the submission of a monthlyquarterly account which includes premium and loss activity for the period with corresponding reserves as established by the ceding company this information is recorded into our records for certain proportional contracts we may require a detailed loss report for claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold or relate to a particular type of loss excess of loss and facultative contracts generally require individual loss reporting with precautionary notices provided when a loss reaches a significant percentage of the attachment point of the contract or when certain causes of loss or types of injury occur our experienced claims staff handles individual loss reports and supporting claim information based on our evaluation of a claim we may establish additional case reserves acrs in addition to the case reserves reported by the ceding company to ensure ceding companies are submitting required and accurate data the underwriting claim reinsurance accounting and internal audit departments of the company perform various reviews of our ceding companies particularly larger ceding companies including onsite audits   we sort both our reinsurance and insurance reserves into exposure groupings for actuarial analysis we assign our business to exposure groupings so that the underlying exposures have reasonably homogeneous loss development characteristics and are large enough to facilitate credible estimation of ultimate losses we periodically review our exposure groupings and we may change our groupings over time as our business changes we currently use over 200 exposure groupings to develop our reserve estimates one of the key selection characteristics for the exposure groupings is the historical duration of the claims settlement process business in which claims are reported and settled relatively quickly are commonly referred to as short tail lines principally property lines on the other hand casualty claims tend to take longer to be reported and settled and casualty lines are generally referred to as long tail lines our estimates of ultimate losses for shorter tail lines with the exception of loss estimates for large catastrophic events generally exhibit less volatility than those for the longer tail lines   we use similar actuarial methodologies such as expected loss ratio chain ladder reserving methods and borhuetter ferguson supplemented by judgment where appropriate to estimate our ultimate losses and lae for each exposure group although we use similar actuarial methodologies for both short tail and long tail lines the faster reporting of experience for the short tail lines allows us to have greater confidence in our estimates of ultimate losses for short tail lines at an earlier stage than for long tail lines as a result we utilize as well exposurebased methods to estimate our ultimate losses for longer tail lines especially for immature accident years for both short and long tail lines we supplement these general approaches with analytically based judgments we cannot estimate losses from widespread catastrophic events such as hurricanes and earthquakes using traditional actuarial methods we estimate losses for these types of events based on information derived from catastrophe models quantitative and qualitative exposure analyses reports and communications from ceding companies and development patterns for historically similar events due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating such losses these estimates are subject to variability which increases with the severity and complexity of the underlying event   our key actuarial assumptions contain no explicit provisions for reserve uncertainty nor do we supplement the actuarially determined reserves for uncertainty        62          our carried reserves at each reporting date are our best estimate of ultimate unpaid losses and lae at that date we complete detailed reserve studies for each exposure group annually for our reinsurance and insurance operations the completed annual reinsurance reserve studies are rolled forward for each accounting period until the subsequent reserve study is completed analyzing the rollforward process involves comparing actual reported losses to expected losses based on the most recent reserve study we analyze significant variances between actual and expected losses and post adjustments to our reserves as warranted   given the inherent variability in our loss reserves we have developed an estimated range of possible gross reserve levels a table of ranges by segment accompanied by commentary on potential and historical variability is included in financial condition  loss and lae reserves the ranges are statistically developed using the exposure groups used in the reserve estimation process and aggregated to the segment level for each exposure group our actuaries calculate a range for each accident year based principally on two variables the first is the historical changes in losses and lae incurred but not reported ibnr for each accident year over time the second is volatility of each accident years held reserves related to estimated ultimate losses also over time both are measured at various ages from the end of the accident year through the final payout of the years losses ranges are developed for the exposure groups using statistical methods to adjust for diversification the ranges for the exposure groups are aggregated to the segment level likewise with an adjustment for diversification our estimates of our reserve variability may not be comparable to those of other companies because there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations our recorded reserves reflect our best point estimate of our liabilities and our actuarial methodologies focus on developing such point estimates we calculate the ranges subsequently based on the historical variability of such reserves   asbestos and environmental exposures we continue to receive claims under expired insurance and reinsurance contracts asserting injuries andor damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances including asbestos environmental claims typically assert liability for a the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or b bodily injury or property damage caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land air or water asbestos claims typically assert liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos   our reserves include an estimate of our ultimate liability for aampe claims our aampe liabilities emanate from mt mckinleys direct insurance business and everest res assumed reinsurance business there are significant uncertainties surrounding our estimates of our potential losses from aampe claims among the uncertainties are a potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage b difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or environmental contamination c difficulty in properly allocating responsibility andor liability for asbestos or environmental damage d changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws e the potential for an asbestos or environmental claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods f questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage and g uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental exposure   due to the uncertainties discussed above the ultimate losses attributable to aampe and particularly asbestos may be subject to more variability than are nonaampe reserves and such variation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations andor cash flows see also item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes 1 and 3 of

loss occurrences our ceded reinsurance provides for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances such reinsurance does not relieve us of our obligation to our policyholders in the event our reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations under these agreements or are able to successfully challenge losses ceded by us under the contracts we will not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance receivable balance to minimize exposure from uncollectible reinsurance receivables we have a reinsurance security committee that evaluates the financial strength of each reinsurer prior to our entering into a reinsurance arrangement in some cases we may hold full or partial collateral for the receivable including letters of credit trust assets and cash additionally creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business written in the us as well as capital markets reinsurance mechanisms are generally required to secure their obligations we have established reserves for uncollectible balances based on our assessment of the collectability of the outstanding balances as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the reserve for uncollectible balances was 216

reinsurance are computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data received from ceding companies premiums earned and the related costs which have not yet been reported to us are estimated and accrued because of the inherent lag in the reporting of written and earned premiums by our ceding companies we use standard accepted actuarial methodologies to estimate earned but not reported premium

shareholders equity to include 1 a greater percentage of publicly traded equity securities 2 emerging market fixed maturities through mutual fund structures as well as individual holdings 3 high yield fixed maturities 4 bank loan securities and 5 private equity limited partnership investments the objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the riskadjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes which are also less subject to changes in value with movements in interest rates we limit our allocation to these asset classes because of 1 the potential for volatility in their values and 2 the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models we use

unpaid claims we continuously reevaluate our reserves including reestimates of prior period reserves taking into consideration all available information and in particular newly reported loss and claim experience changes in reserves resulting from such reevaluations are reflected in incurred losses in the period when the reevaluation is made our analytical methods and processes operate at multiple levels including individual contracts groupings of like contracts classes and lines of business internal business units segments legal entities and in the aggregate in order to set appropriate reserves we make qualitative and quantitative analyses and judgments at these various levels additionally the attribution of reserves changes in reserves and incurred losses among accident years requires qualitative and quantitative adjustments and allocations at these various levels we utilize actuarial science business expertise and management judgment in a manner intended to ensure the accuracy and consistency of our reserving practices nevertheless our reserves are estimates which are subject to variation which may be significant   there can be no assurance that reserves for and losses from claim obligations will not increase in the future possibly by a material amount however we believe that our existing reserves and reserving methodologies lessen the probability that any such increase would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in this context we note that over the past 10 years our calendar year operations have been affected by effects from prior period reserve reestimates ranging from a favorable 399 million in 2014 representing 04 of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made to an unfavorable 2065 million in 2007 representing 26 of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made   we have included ranges for loss reserve estimates determined by our actuaries which have been developed through a combination of objective and subjective criteria our presentation of this information may not be directly comparable to similar presentations of other companies as there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations our recorded reserves are an aggregation of our best point

although totals are displayed for both the low and high range amounts it should be noted that statistically the range of the total is not equal to the sum of the ranges of the segments      depending on the specific segment the range derived for the loss reserves excluding reserves for mt logan re and aampe exposures ranges from minus 97 to minus 152 for the low range and from plus 97 to plus 152 for the high range both the higher and lower ranges are associated with the insurance segment the size of the range is dependent upon the level of confidence associated with the outcome within each range our best estimate of loss reserves is based upon the point estimate derived by our actuaries in detailed reserve studies such ranges are necessarily subjective due to the lack of generally accepted actuarial standards with respect to their development for the above presentation we have assumed what we believe is a reasonable confidence level but note that there can be no assurance that our claim obligations will not vary outside of these ranges   additional losses including those relating to latent injuries and other exposures which are as yet unrecognized the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by us or the reinsurance and insurance industry generally may emerge in the future such future emergence to the extent not covered by existing retrocessional contracts could

2014 we had gross asbestos loss reserves of 4545 million or 955 of total aampe reserves of which 3503 million was for assumed business and 1042 million was for direct business   ultimate loss projections for aampe liabilities cannot be accomplished using standard actuarial techniques we believe that our aampe reserves represent our best estimate of the ultimate liability however there can be no assurance that ultimate loss payments will not exceed such reserves perhaps by a significant amount         68          industry analysts use the survival ratio to compare the aampe reserves among companies with such liabilities the survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a companys current net reserves by the three year average of annual paid losses hence the survival ratio equals the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves if future loss payments were to continue at historical levels using this measurement our net three year asbestos survival ratio was 87 years at december 31 2014 these metrics can be skewed by individual large settlements occurring in the prior three years and therefore may not be indicative of the timing of future payments   shareholders equity our shareholders equity increased to 74511 million as of december 31 2014 from 69683 million as of december 31 2013 this increase was result of 11992 million of net

subsidiaries a key input to the economic models is projected income and this input is continually compared to actual results which may require a change in the capital strategy for example if catastrophe losses are higher than expected we may scale back our share buybacks to offset the impact on capital from the reduced income   during 2014 the company issued 4000 million of senior notes at an attractive interest rate during this low interest rate environment and used 2500 million of the proceeds for maturing senior notes the balance of the proceeds will be used for other operating purposes the senior notes qualify as capital for the rating agency models        69          during 2014 we repurchased 32 million shares for 5000 million in the open market and paid 1459 million in dividends to adjust our capital position and enhance long term expected returns to our shareholders on november 19 2014 our existing board authorization to purchase up to 25 million of our shares was amended to authorize the purchase of up to 30 million shares as of december 31 2014 we had repurchased 237 million shares under this authorization   on july 9 2014 we renewed our shelf registration statement on form s3asr with the securities and exchange commission sec as a well known seasoned issuer this shelf registration statement can be used by group to register common shares preferred shares debt securities warrants share purchase contracts and share purchase units by holdings to register debt securities and by everest re capital trust iii capital trust iii to register trust preferred securities   liquidity our liquidity requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations positive cash flow results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for claims which disbursements generally take place over an extended period after the collection of premiums sometimes a period of many years collected premiums are generally invested prior to their use in such disbursements and investment income provides additional funding for loss payments our net cash flows from operating activities were 13138 million 10983 million and 6946 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively additionally these cash flows reflected net tax payments of 1535 million 693 million and 598 million for years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively and net catastrophe loss payments of 3200 million 4907 million and 5513 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively   if disbursements for claims and benefits policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses were to exceed premium inflows cash flow from reinsurance and insurance operations would be negative the effect on cash flow from insurance operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income additionally cash inflows from investment maturities and dispositions both shortterm investments and longer term maturities are available to supplement other operating cash flows   as the timing of payments for claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty we maintain portfolios of long term invested assets with varying maturities along with shortterm investments that provide additional liquidity for payment of claims at december 31 2014 and 2013 we held cash and shortterm investments of 21434 million and 18256 million respectively all of our shortterm investments are readily marketable and can be converted to cash in addition to these cash and shortterm investments at december 31 2014 we had 11894 million of available for sale fixed maturity securities maturing within one year or less 57263 million maturing within one to five years and 34166 million maturing after five years our 15880 million of equity securities are comprised primarily of publicly traded securities that can be easily liquidated we believe that these fixed maturity and equity securities in conjunction with the shortterm investments and positive cash flow from operations provide ample sources of liquidity for the expected payment of losses in the near future we do not anticipate selling securities or using available credit facilities to pay losses and lae but have the ability to do so sales of securities might result in realized capital gains or losses at december 31 2014 we had 2618 million of net pretax unrealized appreciation comprised of 4308 million of pretax unrealized appreciation and 1690 million of pretax unrealized depreciation   management expects annual positive cash flow from operations which in general reflects the strength of overall pricing to persist over the near term absent any unusual catastrophe activity in the intermediate and long term our cash flow from operations will be impacted to the extent by which competitive pressures affect overall pricing in our markets and by which our premium receipts are impacted from our strategy of emphasizing underwriting profitability over premium volume   in addition to our cash flows from operations and liquid investments we also have a credit facility that provides up to 2000 million of unsecured revolving credit for liquidity but more importantly provides for up to 6000 million of collateralized standby letters of credit to support business written by our bermuda operating subsidiaries         70          effective june 22 2012 group bermuda re and everest international entered into a four year 8000 million senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders which amended and restated in its entirety the july 27 2007 five year 8500 million senior credit facility both the june 22 2012 and july 27 2007 senior credit facilities which have similar terms are referred to as the group credit facility wells fargo corporation wells fargo bank is the administrative agent for the group credit facility which consists of two tranches tranche one provides up to 2000 million of unsecured revolving credit for liquidity and general corporate purposes and for the issuance of unsecured standby letters of credit the interest on the revolving loans shall at the companys option be either 1 the base rate as defined below or 2 an adjusted london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin the base rate is the higher of a the prime commercial lending rate established by wells fargo bank b the federal funds rate plus 05 per annum or c the one month libor rate plus 10 per annum the amount of margin and the fees payable for the group credit facility depends on groups senior unsecured debt rating tranche two exclusively provides up to 6000 million for the issuance of standby letters of credit on a collateralized basis   the group credit facility requires group to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 035 to 1 and to maintain a minimum net worth minimum net worth is an amount equal to the sum of 42500 million plus 25 of consolidated net income for each of groups fiscal quarters for which statements are available ending on or after january 1 2012 and for which consolidated net income is positive plus 25 of any increase in consolidated net worth during such period attributable to the issuance of ordinary and preferred shares which at december 31 2014 was 51158 million as of december 31 2014 the company was in compliance with all group credit facility covenants   at december 31 2014 and 2013 the company had no outstanding shortterm borrowings from the group credit facility revolving credit line there were no shortterm borrowings outstanding for the year ended december 31 2014 the highest amount outstanding for year ended december 31 2013 was 500 million for the period from october 31 2013 to december 2 2013 at december 31 2014 the group credit facility had no outstanding letters of credit under tranche one and 4440 million outstanding letters of credit under tranche two at december 31 2013 the group credit facility had no outstanding letters of credit under tranche one and 5021 million outstanding letters of credit under tranche two   effective august 15 2011 the company entered into a three year three year 1500 million unsecured revolving credit facility referred to as the holdings credit facility which expired on august 15 2014 the company decided not to renew the holdings credit facility at expiration there were no shortterm borrowings outstanding during 2014 at december 31 2013 the company had no outstanding shortterm borrowings from the holdings credit facility revolving credit line the highest amount outstanding for the year ended december 31 2013 was 400 million for the period from may 22 2013 to july 24 2013 at december 31 2013 the holdings credit facility had outstanding letters of credit of 09 million   costs incurred in connection with the group credit facility and the holdings credit facility were 07 million and 10 million for december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively   exposure to catastrophes like other insurance and reinsurance companies we are exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence whether a natural event such as a hurricane or an earthquake or other catastrophe such as an explosion at a major factory a large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties facultative certificates and direct insurance policies across various lines of business   we focus on potential losses that could result from any single event or series of events as part of our evaluation and monitoring of our aggregate exposures to catastrophic events accordingly we employ various techniques to estimate the amount of loss we could sustain from any single catastrophic event or series of events in various geographic areas these techniques range from deterministic approaches such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastropheprone zones and applying reasonable damage factors to modeled approaches that attempt to scientifically measure catastrophe loss exposure using sophisticated monte carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of potential losses on a probabilistic basis        71          no single universal model or group of models is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which we conduct business in addition the form quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for our licensed models which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections further the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined to estimate potential losses by and across business units also while most models have been updated to incorporate claims information from recent catastrophic events catastrophe model projections are still inherently imprecise in addition uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles could add further uncertainty to loss projections from models based on historical data   nevertheless when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events   projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the pml we define pml as our anticipated loss taking into account contract terms and limits caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake the pml will vary depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the makeup of the in force book of business the projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods such as 100year events and 250year events for example a 100year pml is the estimated loss to the current inforce portfolio from a single event which has a 1 probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period in other words it corresponds to a 99 probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated pml it is important to note that pmls are estimates modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model as a result there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event pml   from an enterprise risk management perspective management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure we may underwrite the limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors including but not limited to our financial resources and expected earnings and riskreward analyses of the business being underwritten   management estimates that the projected net economic loss from its largest 100year event in a given zone represents approximately 11 of its projected 2015 shareholders equity economic loss is the pml exposure net of third party reinsurance and the noncontrolling interests of mt logan re reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and estimated income taxes the impact of income taxes on the pml depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity which is also affected by interaffiliate reinsurance management also monitors and controls its largest pmls at multiple points along the loss distribution curve such as loss amounts at the 20 50 100 250 500 and 1000 year return periods this process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk underwriting and capital management decisions   our catastrophe loss projections segmented by risk zones are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process   we believe that our greatest worldwide 1 in 100 year exposure to a single catastrophic event is to a hurricane affecting the us southeast coast where we estimate we have a pml exposure net of third party reinsurance and the noncontrolling interests of mt logan re of 13710 million see also table under item 1 business  risk management of underwriting and retrocession arrangements   if such a single catastrophe loss were to occur management estimates that the economic loss to us would be approximately 8520 million the estimate involves multiple variables including which everest entity would experience the loss and as a result there can be no assurance that this amount would not be exceeded        72          we may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of our operations reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing terms conditions and availability of coverage with the aim of securing cost effective protection the amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time reflecting our view of our exposures and the cost of reinsurance   information technology our information technology is a key component of our business operations and is supported by a team of knowledgeable professionals the majority of our information technology platform is located at our service processing center in new jersey but processing is performed at the office locations of our operating subsidiaries and branches in addition our mainframe processing is performed by a third party vendor at a separate location we have implemented procedures that seek to ensure that our key business systems are protected or secured and data are backed up and stored at offsite locations so that they can be restored promptly if necessary we have documented business continuity plans to provide uninterrupted services for minor service issues and disaster recovery plans with alternative secure data centers for broader outages   our business operations depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology platform which includes data processing and related electronic communications we communicate electronically internally and with our brokers program managers and third party vendors some of these electronic communications involve personal confidential and proprietary information we seek to ensure that all of our systems data and electronic transmissions are appropriately protected from cybersecurity attacks with the latest technology safeguards these include but are not limited to requiring an independent assessment of outside vendors computing environment relative to the services they are providing us   despite these safeguards a significant cyber incident including system

best estimate of losses from claim and related settlement costs both the amounts and timing of such payments are estimates and the inherent variability of resolving claims as well as changes in market conditions make the timing of cash flows uncertain therefore the ultimate amount and timing of loss and lae payments could differ from our estimates      the contractual obligations for senior notes

dividends from everest re its operating insurance subsidiary for its funding capital contributions from group or access to the capital markets our various operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have sufficient cash flow liquidity and investments to settle outstanding reserves for losses and lae management believes that we and each of our entities have sufficient financial resources or ready access thereto to meet all obligations        73          dividends during 2014 2013 and 2012 we declared and paid shareholder dividends of 1459 million 1067 million and 1004 million respectively as an insurance holding company we are partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to our shareholders the payment of dividends to group by holdings ireland is subject to irish corporate and regulatory restrictions the payment of dividends to holdings ireland by holdings and to holdings by everest re is subject to delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment of dividends to group by either bermuda re or everest international is subject to bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions management expects that

in june 2011 fasb issued amendments to existing guidance to provide two alternatives for the presentation of comprehensive income components of net income and comprehensive income can either be presented within a single continuous financial statement or be presented in two separate but consecutive financial statements the company has chosen to present the components of net income and comprehensive income in a single continuous financial statement the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2011 the company implemented this guidance as of january 1

guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2011 the company implemented this guidance as of january 1 2012 and determined that 135 million of previously deferrable acquisition costs would be expensed including 109 million and 26 million expensed in the years ended december 31 2012 and 2013 respectively no additional expense will be incurred related to this

sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period   interest rate risk our 174 billion investment portfolio at december 31 2014 is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities which are generally subject to interest rate risk and some foreign currency exchange rate risk and some equity securities which are subject to price fluctuations and some foreign exchange rate risk the overall economic impact of the foreign exchange risks on the investment portfolio is partially mitigated by changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated liabilities and their associated income statement impact   interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity securities portfolio including shortterm investments from a change in market interest rates in a declining interest rate environment it includes prepayment risk on the 24276 million of mortgagebacked securities in the 131026 million fixed maturity portfolio prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the security   the tables below display the potential impact of market value fluctuations and aftertax unrealized appreciation on our fixed maturity portfolio including 17059 million of shortterm investments for the period indicated based on upward and downward parallel and immediate 100 and 200 basis point shifts in interest rates for legal entities with a us dollar functional currency this modeling was performed on each security individually to generate appropriate price estimates on mortgagebacked securities changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments were taken into account for legal entities with a nonus dollar

and 96732 million of gross reserves for losses and lae as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively these amounts are recorded at their nominal value as opposed to present value which would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the time value of money since losses are paid out over a period of time the present value of the reserves is less than the nominal value as interest rates rise the present value of the reserves decreases and conversely as interest rates decline the present value increases these movements are the opposite of the interest rate impacts on the fair value of investments while the difference between present value and nominal value is not reflected in our financial statements our financial results will include investment income over time from the investment portfolio until the claims are paid our loss and loss reserve obligations have an expected duration of approximately 39 years which is reasonably consistent with our fixed income portfolio if we were to discount our loss and lae reserves net of ceded reserves the discount would be approximately 11 billion resulting in a discounted reserve balance of approximately 80 billion representing

management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period ultimate actual results could differ possibly materially from those estimates   all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated   certain reclassifications and format changes have been made to prior years amounts to conform to the 2014 presentation one reclassification relates to a correction in the manner in which the company reports distributions received from limited partnership investments in the consolidated statements of cash flows prior to the fourth quarter of 2013 the company incorrectly reflected all distributions as cash flows from investing activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows starting with the fourth quarter of 2013 cash distributions from the limited partnerships that represent net investment income are reflected as cash flows from operating activities and distributions that represent the return of capital contributions are reflected as cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december 31 2012 30718 thousand has been reclassified from distributions from other invested assets included in cash flows from investing activities to distribution of limited partnership income included in cash flows from operations the company has determined that this error is not material to the financial statements of any prior period        f8

for its fixed maturities available for sale at market value through shareholders equity net of taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income loss since cash flows from these investments will be primarily used to settle its reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities the company anticipates holding these investments for an extended period as the cash flow from interest and maturities will fund the projected payout of these liabilities fixed maturities carried at fair value represent a portfolio of convertible bond securities which have characteristics similar to equity securities and at times designated foreign denominated fixed maturity securities which will be used to settle loss and loss adjustment reserves in the same currency the company carries all of its equity securities at fair value except for mutual fund investments whose underlying investments are comprised of fixed maturity securities for equity securities available for sale at fair value the company reflects changes in value as net realized capital gains and losses since these securities may be sold in the near term depending on financial market conditions interest income on all fixed maturities and dividend income on all equity securities are included as part of net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss unrealized losses on

by a change in the market interest rate or foreign exchange environment does not constitute an otherthantemporary impairment but rather a temporary decline in market value temporary declines in market value are recorded as unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss if the company determines that the decline is otherthantemporary and the company does not have the intent to sell

recognized pricing services these services seek to utilize market data and observations in their evaluation process they use pricing applications that vary by asset class and incorporate available market information and when fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis the services will apply available information through processes such as benchmark curves benchmarking of like securities sector groupings and matrix pricing in addition they use model processes such as the option adjusted spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios for securities that have prepayment features        f20          in limited instances where prices are not provided by pricing services or in rare instances when a manager may not agree with the pricing service price quotes on a nonbinding basis are obtained from investment brokers the investment asset managers do not make any changes to prices received from either the pricing services or the investment brokers in addition the investment asset managers have procedures in place to review the reasonableness of the prices from the service providers and may request verification of the prices in addition the company continually performs analytical reviews of price changes and tests the prices on a random basis to an independent pricing source no material variances were noted during these price validation procedures in limited situations where financial markets are inactive or illiquid the company may use its own assumptions about future cash flows and riskadjusted discount rates to determine fair value the company made no such adjustments at december 31 2014 and 2013   the company internally manages a small public equity portfolio which had a fair value at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 of 196980 thousand and 174628 thousand respectively and all prices were obtained from publically published sources   equity securities in us denominated currency are categorized as level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets since the securities are actively traded on an exchange and prices are based on quoted prices from the exchange equity securities traded on foreign exchanges are categorized as level 2 due to potential foreign exchange adjustments to fair or market value   fixed maturity securities are generally categorized as level 2 significant other observable inputs since a particular security may not have traded but the pricing services are able to use valuation models with observable market inputs such as interest rate yield curves and prices for similar fixed maturity securities in terms of issuer maturity and seniority valuations that are derived from techniques in which one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable including assumptions about risk are categorized as level 3 significant unobservable inputs these securities include broker priced securities and the companys equity index put option contracts   at december 31 2014 and 2013 all level 3 fixed maturity securities were priced using single nonbinding broker quotes since prices for these securities were not provided by normal pricing service companies the single broker quotes are provided by market makers or brokerdealers who are recognized as market participants in the markets in which they are providing the quotes the prices received from brokers are reviewed for
