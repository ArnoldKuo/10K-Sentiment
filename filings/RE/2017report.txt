indemnify another insurance or reinsurance company the ceding company against all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more insurance contracts reinsurance can provide a ceding company with several benefits including a reduction in its net liability on individual risks or classes of risks catastrophe protection from large andor multiple losses andor a reduction in operating leverage as measured by the ratio of net premiums and reserves to capital reinsurance also provides a ceding company with additional underwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write more business than would be acceptable relative to the ceding companys financial resources reinsurance does not discharge the ceding company from its liability to policyholders rather it reimburses the ceding company for covered losses  3     there are two basic types of reinsurance arrangements treaty and facultative treaty reinsurance obligates the ceding company to cede and the reinsurer to assume a specified portion of a type or category of risks insured by the ceding company treaty reinsurers do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under their treaties instead the reinsurer relies upon the pricing and underwriting decisions made by the ceding company in facultative reinsurance the ceding company cedes and the reinsurer assumes all or part of the risk under a single insurance contract facultative reinsurance is negotiated separately for each insurance contract that is reinsured facultative reinsurance when purchased by ceding companies usually is intended to cover individual risks not covered by their reinsurance treaties because of the dollar limits involved or because the risk is unusual   both treaty and facultative reinsurance can be written on either a pro rata basis or an excess of loss basis under pro rata reinsurance the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion under excess of loss reinsurance the reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses and expenses in excess of a specified dollar amount known as the ceding companys retention or reinsurers attachment point generally subject to a negotiated reinsurance contract limit   in pro rata reinsurance the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission the ceding commission generally is based on the ceding companys cost of acquiring the business being reinsured commissions premium taxes assessments and miscellaneous administrative expense and may contain profit sharing provisions whereby the ceding commission is adjusted based on loss experience premiums paid by the ceding company to a reinsurer for excess of loss reinsurance are not directly proportional to the premiums that the ceding company receives because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk there is usually no ceding commission on excess of loss reinsurance   reinsurers may purchase reinsurance to cover their own risk exposure reinsurance of a reinsurers business is called a retrocession reinsurance companies cede risks under retrocessional agreements to other reinsurers known as retrocessionaires for reasons similar to those that cause insurers to purchase reinsurance to reduce net liability on individual or classes of risks protect against catastrophic losses stabilize financial ratios and obtain additional underwriting capacity   reinsurance can be written through intermediaries generally professional reinsurance brokers or directly with ceding companies from a ceding companys perspective the broker and the direct distribution channels have advantages and disadvantages a ceding companys decision to select one distribution channel over the other will be influenced by its perception of such advantages and disadvantages relative to the reinsurance coverage being placed   business strategy the companys business strategy is to sustain its leadership position within targeted reinsurance and insurance markets provide effective management throughout the property and casualty underwriting cycle and thereby achieve an attractive return for its shareholders the companys underwriting strategies seek to capitalize on its i financial strength and capacity ii global franchise iii stable and experienced management team iv diversified product and distribution offerings v underwriting expertise and disciplined approach vi efficient and lowcost operating structure and vii effective enterprise risk management practices   the company offers treaty and facultative reinsurance and admitted and nonadmitted insurance the companys products include the full range of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance coverages including marine aviation surety errors and omissions liability eampo directors and officers liability dampo medical malpractice other specialty lines accident and health aamph and workers compensation   the companys underwriting strategies emphasizes underwriting profitability over premium volume key elements of this strategy include careful risk selection appropriate pricing through strict underwriting discipline and adjustment of the companys business mix in response to changing market conditions the company focuses on reinsuring companies that effectively manage the underwriting cycle through proper analysis and pricing of underlying risks and whose underwriting guidelines and performance are compatible with its objectives  4     the companys underwriting strategies emphasize flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions the company believes that its existing strengths including its broad underwriting expertise global presence strong financial ratings and substantial capital facilitate adjustments to its mix of business geographically by line of business and by type of coverage allowing it to participate in those market opportunities that provide the greatest potential for underwriting profitability the companys insurance operations complement these strategies by accessing business that is not available on a reinsurance basis the company carefully monitors its mix of business across all operations to avoid unacceptable geographic or other risk concentrations   commencing in 2015 the company initiated a strategic build out of its insurance platform through the investment in key leadership hires which in turn has brought significant underwriting talent and stronger direction in achieving its insurance program strategic goals of increased premium volume and improved underwriting results recent growth is coming from highly diversified areas including newly launched lines of business as well as product and geographic expansion in existing lines of business the company is building a worldclass insurance platform capable of offering products across lines and geographies complementing its leading global reinsurance franchise as part of this initiative the company received approval from lloyds of london to launch a new syndicate which provides access to additional international business and new product opportunities to further diversify and broaden its insurance portfolio in 2016 and going forward   marketing the company writes business on a worldwide basis for many different customers and lines of business thereby obtaining a broad spread of risk the company is not substantially dependent on any single customer small group of customers line of business or geographic area for the 2016 calendar year no single customer ceding company or insured generated more than 3 of the companys gross written premiums the company believes that a reduction of business from any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on its future financial condition or results of operations   approximately 60 30 and 10 of the companys 2016 gross written premiums were written in the broker reinsurance insurance and direct reinsurance markets respectively   the broker reinsurance market consists of several substantial national and international brokers and a number of smaller specialized brokers brokers do not have the authority to bind the company with respect to reinsurance agreements nor does the company commit in advance to accept any portion of a brokers submitted business reinsurance business from any ceding company whether new or renewal is subject to acceptance by the company brokerage fees are generally paid by reinsurers the companys ten largest brokers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 53 of gross written premiums in 2016 the largest broker marsh and mclennan accounted for approximately 19 of gross written premiums the second largest broker aon benfield re accounted for approximately 18 of gross written premiums the company believes that a reduction of business assumed from any one broker would not have a material adverse effect on the company   the direct reinsurance market remains an important distribution channel for reinsurance business written by the company direct placement of reinsurance enables the company to access clients who prefer to place their reinsurance directly with reinsurers based upon the reinsurers indepth understanding of the ceding companys needs   the companys insurance business writes direct business targeting commercial property and casualty it also writes business through brokers surplus lines brokers and general

of the companys strategies is to lead as many of the reinsurance treaties it underwrites as possible the company leads on approximately twothirds of its treaty reinsurance business as measured by premium the lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in the strongest position to negotiate price terms and conditions management believes this strategy enables it to obtain more favorable terms and conditions on the treaties on which it participates when the company does not lead the treaty it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty the company may decline to participate on a treaty based upon its assessment of all relevant factors   the companys treaty underwriting process involves a team approach among the companys underwriters actuaries and claim staff treaties are reviewed for compliance with the companys general underwriting standards and most larger treaties are subjected to detailed actuarial analysis the actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the subject exposures and loss experience the company does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties the company does however evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty the company may also conduct underwriting operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding companies to monitor adherence to underwriting guidelines underwriting audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff pricing and risk selection and rate monitoring over time claim audits may be performed in order to evaluate the clients claims handling abilities and practices   the companys facultative underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks limits and maximum risk exposures specified classes of large premium us risks are referred to everest res new york facultative headquarters for specific review before premium quotations are given to clients in addition the companys guidelines require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate limits complexity or volatility regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract nonus risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within the involved operations   in addition to its own underwriting staff the companys insurance operations write casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through select program managers these programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and the program managers capabilities the companys rates forms and underwriting guidelines are tailored to specific risk types the companys underwriting actuarial claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate performance monitoring mechanisms   risk management of underwriting and reinsurance arrangements   underwriting risk and accumulation controls each segment and business unit manages its underwriting risk in accordance with established guidelines these guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors including reinsured company profile line of business geographic location and risk hazards in each case the guidelines permit limited exceptions which must be authorized by the companys senior management management regularly reviews and revises these guidelines in response to changes in business unit product offerings market conditions risk versus reward analyses and the companys enterprise and underwriting risk management processes    10     the operating results and financial condition of the company can be adversely affected by catastrophe and other large losses the company manages its exposure to catastrophes and other large losses by           selective underwriting practices              diversifying its risk portfolio by geographic area and by types and classes of business              limiting its aggregate catastrophe loss exposure in any particular geographic zone and contiguous zones              purchasing reinsurance andor retrocessional protection to the extent that such coverage can be secured costeffectively see reinsurance and retrocession arrangements       like other insurance and reinsurance companies the company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence whether a natural event such as a hurricane or an earthquake or other catastrophe such as an explosion at a major factory a large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties facultative certificates and direct insurance policies across various lines of business   the company focuses on potential losses that could result from any single event or series of events as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events accordingly the company employs various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain from any single catastrophic event or series of events in various geographic areas these techniques range from deterministic approaches such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastropheprone zones and applying reasonable damage factors to modeled approaches that attempt to scientifically measure catastrophe loss exposure using sophisticated monte carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of potential losses on a probabilistic basis   no single computer model or group of models is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which the company conducts business in addition the form quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by reinsureds is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for the companys licensed models which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections further the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined to estimate potential losses by and across business units also while most models have been updated to incorporate claims information from recent catastrophic events catastrophe model projections are still inherently imprecise in addition uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles could add further uncertainty to loss projections from models based on historical data   nevertheless when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events   projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss pml the company defines pml as its anticipated loss taking into account contract terms and limits caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake the pml will vary depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the makeup of the in force book of business the projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods such as 100year events and 250year events for example a 100year pml is the estimated loss to the current inforce portfolio from a single event which has a 1 probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period in other words it corresponds to a 99 probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated pml it is important to note that pmls are estimates modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model as a result there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event pml    11     from an enterprise risk management perspective management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure the company may underwrite the limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors including but not limited to the companys financial resources and expected earnings and riskreward analyses of the business being underwritten   the company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of its operations reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing terms conditions availability and collectability of coverage with the aim of securing cost effective protection from financially secure counterparties the amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time reflecting the companys view of its exposures and the cost of reinsurance   management estimates that the projected net economic loss from its largest 100year event in a given zone represents approximately 11 of its december 31 2016 shareholders equity economic loss is the pml exposure net of third party reinsurance reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and estimated income taxes the impact of income taxes on the pml depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity which is also affected by interaffiliate reinsurance management also monitors and controls its largest pmls at multiple points along the loss distribution curve such as loss amounts at the 20 50 100 250 500 and 1000 year return periods this process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk underwriting and capital management decisions   the companys catastrophe loss projections segmented by risk zones are updated

with its enterprise risk management underwriting and capital management plans however there is much uncertainty and imprecision inherent in the catastrophe models and the catastrophe loss estimation process generally as a result there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses from individual events that exceed the pml or other return period projections perhaps by a material amount nor can there be assurance that the company will not experience events impacting multiple zones or multiple severe events that could in the aggregate exceed the companys pml expectations by a significant amount    12     terrorism risk  while the company writes some reinsurance contracts covering terrorism the companys risk management philosophy is to limit the amount of exposure by geographic region and to strictly manage coverage for properties in areas that may be considered a target for terrorists providing terrorism coverage on reinsurance contracts is negotiable and many but not all treaties contain exclusions which limit much of this risk while many property insurance policies are required to offer coverage for terrorism this coverage is often not purchased however terrorism is typically covered by worker compensation policies as a result the company is exposed to losses from terrorism on both its reinsurance and its insurance book of business particularly its workers compensation and property policies however the insurance book generally does not insure large corporations or corporate locations that represent large concentrations of risk   the us terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 provides some protection to the insurance book of business it also provides indirect protection to exposed reinsurance treaties however the company is still exposed to risk of loss from terrorism due to deductibles copays and uncovered lines of business   reinsurance and retrocession arrangements  the company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of its operations reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing terms conditions and availability of coverage with the aim of securing cost effective protection the amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time reflecting the companys view of its exposures and the cost of reinsurance in recent years the company has increased its use of reinsurance offered through capital market facilities   the company participates in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties whereby a ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its reinsurers under one or more of its reinsurance treaties common account retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies including the ceding company with respect to the involved treaties   all of the companys reinsurance and retrocessional agreements transfer significant reinsurance risk and therefore are accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance   at december 31 2016 the company had 10183 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to both paid and unpaid losses ceded of this amount 1750 million or 172 was receivable from resolution group reinsurance barbados limited resolution group 1290 million or 127 was receivable from cv starr bermuda cv starr 1094 million or 107 was receivable from zurich vericherungs gesellschaft zurich 782 million or 77 was receivable from mt logan re segregated accounts and 511 million or 50 was receivable from federal crop insurance corporation fcic the receivables from resolution group and cv starr are fully collateralized by individual trust agreements no other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5 of our receivables although management carefully selects its reinsurers the company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve the company of its liability to insureds or ceding companies see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition   claims reinsurance claims are managed by the companys professional claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial loss reports and coverage issues monitoring claims handling activities of ceding companies establishing and adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of claims in addition to claims assessment processing and payment the claims staff selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies insurance claims are generally handled by third party claims service providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the companys professional claims staff    13     the company intensively manages its asbestos and environmental aampe exposures through a dedicated centrally managed claim staff with experienced claim and legal professionals who specialize in the handling of such exposures they actively manage each individual insured and reinsured account responding to claim developments with evaluations of the involved exposures and adjustment of reserves as appropriate specific or general claim developments that may have material implications for the company are regularly communicated to senior management actuarial legal and financial areas senior management and claim management personnel meet at least quarterly to review the companys overall reserve positions and make changes if appropriate the company continually reviews its internal processing communications and analytics seeking to enhance the management of its aampe exposures in particular in regard to changes in asbestos claims and litigation   reserves for unpaid property and casualty losses and lae significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the insurer by the reinsurer to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and lae insurers and reinsurers establish reserves which are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses for losses that have already occurred actual losses and lae paid may deviate perhaps substantially from such reserves to the extent reserves prove to be insufficient to cover actual losses and lae after taking into account available reinsurance coverage the company would have to recognize such reserve shortfalls and incur a charge to earnings which could be material in the period such recognition takes place see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  loss and lae reserves   as part of the reserving process insurers and reinsurers evaluate historical data and trends and make judgments as to the impact of various factors such as legislative and judicial developments that may affect future claim amounts changes in social and political attitudes that may increase loss exposures and inflationary and general economic trends while the reserving process is difficult and subjective for insurance companies the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer due primarily to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies in addition trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development in the same manner or to the same degree in the future as a result actual losses and lae may deviate perhaps substantially from estimates of reserves reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements   the companys loss and lae reserves represent managements best estimate of the ultimate liability while there can be no assurance that these reserves will not need to be increased in the future management believes that the companys existing reserves and reserving methodologies reduce the likelihood that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results

the safe harbor provisions contained therein see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  safe harbor disclosure   like many other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies the company has experienced loss development for prior accident years which has impacted losses and lae reserves and caused corresponding effects to income

policy and guidelines and together with senior management for overseeing their execution   the companys principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet its insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize aftertax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio considering these objectives the company views its investment portfolio as having two components 1 the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities its core fixed maturities portfolio and 2 investments funded by the companys shareholders equity   for the portion needed to satisfy global outstanding liabilities the company generally invests in taxable and taxpreferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of aa3 for the us portion of this portfolio the companys mix of taxable and taxpreferenced investments is adjusted periodically consistent with the companys current and projected us operating results market conditions and our tax position this global fixed maturity securities portfolio is externally managed by an independent professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by the company   over the past several years the company has expanded the allocation of its investments funded by shareholders equity to include 1 a greater percentage of publicly traded equity securities 2 emerging market fixed maturities through mutual fund structures as well as individual holdings 3 high yield fixed maturities 4 bank loan securities and 5 private equity limited partnership investments the objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the riskadjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes which are also less subject to changes in value with movements in interest rates the company limits its allocation to these asset classes because of 1 the potential for volatility in their values and 2 the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models the company uses investment managers experienced in these markets and adjusts its allocation to these investments based upon market conditions at december 31 2016 the market value of investments in these investment market sectors carried at both market and fair value approximated 50 of shareholders equity   the duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early prepayments the companys fixed income investment guidelines include a general duration guideline this investment duration guideline is established and periodically revised by management which considers economic and business factors as well as the companys average duration of potential liabilities which at december 31 2016 is estimated at approximately 42 years based on the estimated payouts of underwriting liabilities using standard duration calculations   the duration of the fixed income portfolio at december 31 2016 and 2015 was 33 years and 32 years respectively the company has shortened the duration of its portfolio in recent years in response to very low available yields particularly on securities with longer maturities as a result the company has focused on purchasing high quality shorter duration investments and investments with floating rate yields these investments will be less subject to decline in market value if interest rates rise in the future as forecasted by most investment analysts   for each currency in which the company has established substantial loss and lae reserves the company seeks to maintain invested assets denominated in such currency in an amount approximately equal to the estimated liabilities approximately 29 of the companys consolidated reserves for losses and lae and unearned premiums represent amounts payable in foreign currencies   the companys net investment income was 4731 million 4735 million and 5305 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the slight decrease from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to a decline in income from fixed maturities reflective of lower reinvestment rates partially offset by an increase in income from limited partnerships the decline from 2015 to 2014 was mainly due to a decline in income from fixed maturities reflective of lower reinvestment rates and a decline in income from limited partnerships    17     the company had net realized capital losses for 2016 of 72 million in 2016 the company recorded 316 million of otherthantemporary impairments on fixed maturity securities 280 million of realized capital loss from the sale of its heartland subsidiary and 67 million of net realized capital losses from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities partially offset by 591 million of gains due to fair value remeasurements in 2015 net realized capital losses were 1841 million due to 1022 million of otherthantemporary impairments on fixed maturity securities 456 million of losses due to fair value remeasurements and 363 million of net realized capital losses from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities in 2014 net realized capital gains were 840 million due to 1217 million of gains from fair value remeasurements on fixed maturity and equity securities and 19 million of net realized capital gains from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities partially offset by 395 million of otherthantemporary impairments on fixed maturity securities   the companys cash and invested assets

presented in the following table were in effect as of february 10 2017   the company believes that its ratings are important as they provide the companys customers and its investors with an independent assessment of the companys financial strength using a rating scale that provides for relative comparisons strong financial ratings are particularly important for reinsurance companies ceding companies must rely on their reinsurers to pay covered losses well into the future as a result a highly rated reinsurer is generally preferred      operating subsidiary       am best

competition the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive as well as cyclical by product and market as such financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of constrained availability higher rates and stronger profits followed by periods of abundant capacity lower rates and constrained profitability competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that we underwrite is based on many factors including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by am best andor standard amp poors underwriting expertise the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized capacity and coverages offered premiums charged other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered services offered speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written furthermore the market impact from these competitive factors related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels   the company competes in the us bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors the companys competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies domestic and international underwriting operations including underwriting syndicates at lloyds of london and certain government sponsored risk transfer vehicles some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company and have established long term and continuing business relationships which can be a significant competitive advantage in addition the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and recently the securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition   worldwide insurance and reinsurance market conditions continued to be very competitive particularly in the property catastrophe and casualty reinsurance lines of business generally there was ample insurance and reinsurance capacity relative to demand as well as additional capital from the capital markets through insurance linked financial instruments these financial instruments such as side cars catastrophe bonds and collateralized reinsurance funds provide capital markets with access to insurance and reinsurance risk exposure the capital markets demand for these products is being primarily driven by the current low interest rate environment and the desire to achieve greater risk diversification and potentially higher returns on their investments this increased competition is generally having a negative impact on rates terms and conditions however the impact varies widely by market and coverage   rates tend to fluctuate by specific region and products particularly areas recently impacted by large catastrophic events although there were flooding and wind storm events and earthquakes in parts of the world the overall 2013 2014 and 2015 catastrophe losses for the industry were considerably lower than average during 2016 there was an increase in catastrophes the fort mcmurray canadian wildfire hurricane matthew which affected a large area of the caribbean and southeastern united states storms and an earthquake in ecuador there are industry predictions that the catastrophe losses for 2016 may exceed the inflationadjusted ten year average catastrophe amounts while the future impact on market conditions from these catastrophes cannot be determined at this time it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall markets but may impact loss affected areas    22     commencing in 2015 the company initiated a strategic build out of its insurance platform through the investment in key leadership hires which in turn has brought significant underwriting talent and stronger direction in achieving our insurance program strategic goals of increased premium volume and improved underwriting results recent growth is coming from highly diversified areas including newly launched lines of business as well as product and geographic expansion in existing lines of business the company is building a worldclass insurance platform capable of offering products across lines and geographies complementing our leading global reinsurance franchise as part of this initiative the company received approval from lloyds of london to launch a new syndicate in 2016 which provided the company access to additional international business and new product opportunities to further diversify and broaden its insurance portfolio   overall the company believes that given its size strong ratings distribution system reputation expertise and capital market vehicle activity the current marketplace conditions provide profit opportunities the company continues to employ its strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit potential while maintaining balance and diversification in its overall portfolio   employees as of february 1 2017 the company employed 1121 persons management believes that employee relations are good none of the companys employees are

companys statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital rbc if this ratio is above a minimum threshold no action is necessary below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which an insurers domiciliary state regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over an insurer as the ratio of surplus to rbc decreases the mildest intervention requires an insurer to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions the most severe action requires an insurer to be rehabilitated or liquidated  25     based on their financial positions at december 31 2016 everest re everest

to predict whether any such proposal will be adopted the form in which any such proposals would be adopted or the effect if any the adoption of any such proposal or change in the rbc calculations

reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec   item 1a risk factors   in addition to the other information provided in this report the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in our securities if the circumstances contemplated by the individual risk factors materialize our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly    26     risks relating to our business   fluctuations in the financial markets could result in investment losses   prolonged and severe disruptions in the overall public debt and equity markets such as occurred during 2008 could result in significant realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio although financial markets have significantly improved since 2008 they could deteriorate in the future there could also be disruption in individual market sectors such as occurred in the energy sector in recent years such declines in the financial markets could result in significant realized and unrealized losses on investments and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations equity business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings   our results could be adversely affected by catastrophic events   we are exposed to unpredictable catastrophic events including weatherrelated and other natural catastrophes as well as acts of terrorism any material reduction in our operating results caused by the occurrence of one or more catastrophes could inhibit our ability to pay dividends or to meet our interest and principal payment obligations by way of illustration during the past five calendar years pretax catastrophe losses net of contract specific reinsurance but before cessions under corporate reinsurance programs were as follows        calendar year   pretax catastrophe losses     dollars in millions           2016        3012       2015       538       2014       563       2013       1940       2012       4100        our losses from future catastrophic events could exceed our projections   we use projections of possible losses from future catastrophic events of varying types and magnitudes as a strategic underwriting tool we use these loss projections to estimate our potential catastrophe losses in certain geographic areas and decide on the placement of retrocessional coverage or other actions to limit the extent of potential losses in a given geographic area these loss projections are approximations reliant on a mix of quantitative and qualitative processes and actual losses may exceed the projections by a material amount resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations    27     if our loss reserves are inadequate to meet our actual losses our net income would be reduced or we could incur a loss   we are required to maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liability of losses and lae for both reported and unreported claims incurred these reserves are only estimates of what we believe the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances known to us in setting reserves for our reinsurance liabilities we rely on claim data supplied by our ceding companies and brokers and we employ actuarial and statistical projections the information received from our ceding companies is not always timely or accurate which can contribute to inaccuracies in our loss projections because of the uncertainties that surround our estimates of loss and lae reserves we cannot be certain that ultimate losses and lae payments will not exceed our estimates if our reserves are deficient we would be required to increase loss reserves in the period in which such deficiencies are identified which would cause a charge to our earnings and a reduction of capital however during the past five calendar years the reserve reestimation process resulted in an increase to our pretax net income all years        calendar year   effect on pretax net income    dollars in millions             2016        2953     increase     2015       651     increase     2014       397     increase     2013       182     increase     2012       37     increase      the difficulty in estimating our reserves is significantly more challenging as it relates to reserving for potential aampe liabilities at yearend 2016 43 of our gross reserves were comprised of aampe reserves aampe liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons including the long delays between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental contamination long reporting delays and difficulty in properly allocating liability for the asbestos or environmental damage legal tactics and judicial and legislative developments affecting the scope of insurers liability which can be difficult to predict also contribute to uncertainties in estimating reserves for aampe liabilities   the failure to accurately assess underwriting risk and establish adequate premium rates could reduce our net income or result in a net loss   our success depends on our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained if we fail to accurately assess the risks we retain we may fail to establish adequate premium rates to cover our losses and lae this could reduce our net income and even result in a net loss   in addition losses may arise from events or exposures that are not anticipated when the coverage is priced in addition to unanticipated events we also face the unanticipated expansion of our exposures particularly in longtail liability lines an example of this is the expansion over time of the scope of insurers legal liability within the mass tort arena particularly for aampe exposures discussed above   decreases in pricing for property and casualty reinsurance and insurance could reduce our net income   the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive as well as cyclical by product and market these cycles as well as other factors that influence aggregate supply and demand for property and casualty insurance and reinsurance products are outside of our control the supply of reinsurance is driven by prevailing prices and levels of capacity that may fluctuate in response to a number of factors including large catastrophic losses and investment returns being realized in the insurance industry demand for reinsurance is influenced by underwriting results of insurers and insureds including catastrophe losses and prevailing general economic conditions if any of these factors were to result in a decline in the demand for reinsurance or an overall increase in reinsurance capacity our net income could decrease    28     if rating agencies downgrade the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries future prospects for growth and profitability could be significantly and adversely affected   our active insurance company subsidiaries currently hold financial strength ratings assigned by thirdparty rating agencies which assess and rate the claims paying ability and financial strength of insurers and reinsurers our active subsidiaries carry an a superior rating from am best everest re bermuda re ireland re everest national and everest indemnity hold an a strong rating from standard amp poors and everest assurance holds an a strong rating from this same agency everest re and bermuda re hold an a1 uppermedium grade rating from moodys financial strength ratings are used by client companies and agents and brokers that place the business as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers a downgrade or withdrawal of any of these ratings might adversely affect our ability to market our insurance products and could have a material and adverse effect on future prospects for growth and profitability   consistent with market practice much of our treaty reinsurance business allows the ceding company to terminate the contract or seek collateralization of our obligations in the event of a rating downgrade below a certain threshold the termination provision would generally be triggered if a rating fell below am bests a rating level which is three levels below everest res current rating of a to a lesser extent everest re also has modest exposure to reinsurance contracts that contain provisions for obligatory funding of outstanding liabilities in the event of a rating agency downgrade those provisions would also generally be triggered if everest res rating fell below am bests a rating level   the failure of our insureds intermediaries and reinsurers to satisfy their obligations to us could reduce our income   in accordance with industry practice we have uncollateralized receivables from insureds agents and brokers andor rely on agents and brokers to process our payments we may not be able to collect amounts due from insureds agents and brokers resulting in a reduction to net income   we are subject to credit risk of reinsurers in connection with retrocessional arrangements because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve us of our liability to the insured in addition reinsurers may be unwilling to pay us even though they are able to do so the failure of one or more of our reinsurers to honor their obligations to us in a timely fashion would impact our cash flow and reduce our net income and could cause us to incur a significant loss   if we are unable or choose not to purchase reinsurance and transfer risk to the reinsurance markets our net income could be reduced or we could incur a net loss in the event of unusual loss experience   we are generally less reliant on the purchase of reinsurance than many of our competitors in part because of our strategic emphasis on underwriting discipline and management of the cycles inherent in our business we try to separate our risk taking process from our risk mitigation process in order to avoid developing too great a reliance on reinsurance historically we generally purchased reinsurance from other third parties only when we expect a net benefit with the expansion of the capital markets into insurance linked financial instruments we increased our use of capital market products for catastrophe reinsurance starting in 2014 in addition some of our quota share contracts with larger retrocessions were increased during 2014 the percentage of business that we reinsure may vary considerably from year to year depending on our view of the relationship between cost and expected benefit for the contract period        2016   2015   2014   2013   2012     percentage of ceded written premiums to gross written premiums   126   120   109   45   53      because we have purchased minimal reinsurance in recent years our net income could be reduced following a large unreinsured event or adverse overall claims experience    29     our industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future   our industry is highly competitive and subject to pricing cycles that can be pronounced we compete globally in the united states bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous competitors our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations including underwriting syndicates at lloyds of london   according to standard amp poors we rank among the top ten global reinsurance groups where more than twothirds of the market share is concentrated the worldwide net premium written by the top 40 global reinsurance groups for both life and nonlife business was estimated to be 194 billion in 2015 according to data compiled by standard amp poors the leaders in this market are munich re swiss re hannover rueckversicherung ag berkshire hathaway inc scor se and syndicates at lloyds of london some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry which can be a significant competitive advantage in addition the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the entry of alternative capital market products and vehicles provide additional sources of reinsurance and insurance capacity and increased competition   we are dependent on our key personnel   our success has been and will continue to be dependent on our ability to retain the services of our chairman joseph v taranto age 67 and existing key executive officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future the loss of the services of any key executive officer or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct business generally we consider key executive officers to be those individuals who have the greatest influence in setting overall policy and controlling operations president and chief executive officer dominic j addesso age 63 executive vice president and chief financial officer craig howie age 53 executive vice president and chief executive officer reinsurance division john p doucette age 51 executive vice president general counsel chief compliance officer and secretary sanjoy mukherjee age 50 and president north america insurance division jonathan zaffino age 44 we currently have an agreement with mr taranto to serve as a nonemployee director and chairman of the board through december 31 2019 subject to mr tarantos annual election to the board by its shareholders during its annual general meetings that occur over the term of the agreement we have employment contracts with mr addesso mr howie mr doucette and mr mukherjee which have been filed with the sec and provide for terms of employment ending on december 31 2018 for mr addesso april 1 2019 for mr howie june 1 2019 for mr doucette and january 1 2020 for mr mukherjee   special considerations apply to our bermuda operations under bermuda law nonbermudians other than spouses of bermudians and individuals holding permanent or working resident certificates are not permitted to engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without a work permit issued by the bermuda government a work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show that after a proper public advertisement no bermudian spouse of a bermudian or individual holding a permanent or working resident certificate is available who meets the minimum standards reasonably required for the position the bermuda government places a sixyear term limit on individuals with work permits subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be key employees of businesses with a significant physical presence in bermuda currently all our bermudabased professional employees who require work permits have been granted permits by the bermuda government that expire at various times between february 2017 and september 2019 this includes sanjoy mukherjee the chief executive officer of our bermuda reinsurance operation    30     our investment values and investment income could decline because they are exposed to interest rate credit and market risks   a significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and smaller portions consist of equity securities and other investments both the fair market value of our invested assets and associated investment income fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions for example the fair market value of our predominant fixed income portfolio generally increases or decreases inversely to fluctuations in interest rates the market value of our fixed income securities could also decrease as a result of a downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of such securities to deteriorate the net investment income that we realize from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates   interest rate fluctuations also can cause net investment income from fixed income investments that carry prepayment risk such as mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities to differ from the income anticipated from those securities at the time of purchase in addition if issuers of individual investments are unable to meet their obligations investment income will be reduced and realized capital losses may arise   the majority of our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale and temporary changes in the market value of these investments are reflected as changes to our shareholders equity our actively managed equity security portfolios are fair valued and any changes in fair value are reflected as net realized capital gains or losses as a result a decline in the value of our securities reduces our capital or could cause us to incur a loss   we have invested a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities the value of these assets fluctuates with changes in the markets in times of economic weakness the fair value of these assets may decline and may negatively impact net income we also invest in nontraditional investments which have different risk characteristics than traditional fixed income and equity securities these alternative investments are comprised primarily of private equity limited partnerships the changes in value and investment incomeloss for these partnerships may be more volatile than overthecounter securities   the following table quantifies the portion of our investment portfolio that consists of fixed income securities equity securities and investments that carry prepayment risk          at         dollars in millions     december 31 2016      of

may not reconcile due to rounding                       31     we may experience foreign currency exchange losses that reduce our net income and capital levels   through our bermuda and international operations we conduct business in a variety of foreign nonus currencies principally the euro the british pound the canadian dollar and the singapore dollar assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates our reporting currency is the us dollar and exchange rate fluctuations especially relative to the us dollar may materially impact our results and financial position in 2016 we wrote approximately 251 of our coverages in nonus currencies as of december 31 2016 we maintained approximately 124 of our investment portfolio in investments denominated in nonus currencies during 2016 2015 and 2014 the impact on our quarterly pretax net income from exchange rate fluctuations ranged from a loss of 272 million to a gain of 471 million   we are subject to cybersecurity risks that could negatively impact our business operations   we are dependent upon our information technology platform including our processing systems data and electronic transmissions in our business operations security breaches could expose us to the loss or misuse of our information litigation and potential liability in addition cyber incidents that impact the availability reliability speed accuracy or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant negative impact on our operations and possibly our results an incident could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws damage our reputation cause a loss of customers or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties which could be significant management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our operations   risks relating to regulation   insurance laws and regulations restrict our ability to operate and any failure to comply with those laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business   we are subject to extensive and increasing regulation under us state and foreign insurance laws these laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to us by our operating subsidiaries impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that we can hold prescribe solvency accounting and internal control standards that must be met and maintained and require us to maintain reserves these laws also require disclosure of material interaffiliate transactions and require prior approval of extraordinary transactions such extraordinary transactions include declaring dividends from operating subsidiaries that exceed statutory thresholds these laws also generally require approval of changes of control of insurance companies the application of these laws could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends interest and other payments on securities as applicable and could restrict our ability to expand our business operations through acquisitions of new insurance subsidiaries we may not have or maintain all required licenses and approvals or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us these types of actions could have a material adverse effect on our business to date no material fine penalty or restriction has been imposed on us for failure to comply with any insurance law or regulation   as a result of the previous dislocation of the financial markets congress and the outgoing presidential administration in the united states implemented changes in the way the financial services industry is regulated some of these changes are also impacting the insurance industry for example the united states department of treasury established the federal insurance office with the authority to monitor all aspects of the insurance sector monitor the extent to which traditionally underserved communities and consumers have access to affordable nonhealth insurance products to represent the united states on prudential aspects of international insurance matters to assist with administration of the terrorism risk insurance program and to advise on important national and international insurance matters in addition regulatory bodies in europe are developing a new capital adequacy directive for insurers and reinsurers the future impact of such initiatives or new initiatives from the incoming presidential administration if any on our operation net income loss or financial condition cannot be determined at this time  32     regulatory challenges in the united states could adversely affect the ability of bermuda re to conduct business   bermuda re does not intend to be licensed or admitted as an insurer or reinsurer in any us jurisdiction under current law bermuda re generally will be permitted to reinsure us risks from its office in bermuda without obtaining those licenses however the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework is subject to periodic legislative review and revision in the past there have been congressional and other initiatives in the united states regarding increased supervision and regulation of the insurance industry including proposals to supervise and regulate reinsurers domiciled outside the united states if bermuda re were to become subject to any insurance laws of the united states or any us state at any time in the future it might be required to post deposits or maintain minimum surplus levels and might be prohibited from engaging in lines of business or from writing some types of policies complying with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business in bermuda and international markets   bermuda re may need to be licensed or admitted in additional jurisdictions to develop its business   as bermuda res business develops it will monitor the need to obtain licenses in jurisdictions other than bermuda and the uk where it has an authorized branch in order to comply with applicable law or to be able to engage in additional insurancerelated activities in addition bermuda re may be at a competitive disadvantage in jurisdictions where it is not licensed or does not enjoy an exemption from licensing relative to competitors that are so licensed or exempt from licensing bermuda re may not be able to obtain any additional licenses that it determines are necessary or desirable furthermore the process of obtaining those licenses is often costly and may take a long time   bermuda res ability to write reinsurance may be severely limited if it is unable to arrange for security to back its reinsurance   many jurisdictions do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or nonadmitted insurers on their statutory financial statements without appropriate security bermuda res reinsurance clients typically require it to post a letter of credit or enter into other security arrangements if bermuda re is unable to obtain or maintain a letter of credit facility on commercially acceptable terms or is unable to arrange for other types of security its ability to operate its business may be severely limited if bermuda re defaults on any letter of credit that it obtains it may be required to prematurely liquidate a substantial portion of its investment portfolio and other assets pledged as collateral   risks relating to groups securities   because of our holding company structure our ability to pay dividends interest and principal is dependent on our receipt of dividends loan payments and other funds from our subsidiaries   group and holdings are holding companies each of whose most significant asset consists of the stock of its operating subsidiaries as a result each of groups and holdings ability to pay dividends interest or other payments on its securities in the future will depend on the earnings and cash flows of the operating subsidiaries and the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to it this ability is subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors beyond our control payment of dividends and advances and repayments from some of the operating subsidiaries are regulated by us state and foreign insurance laws and regulatory restrictions including minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds accordingly the operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to group and holdings in the future which could prevent us from paying dividends interest or other payments on our securities  33     provisions in groups byelaws could have an antitakeover effect which could diminish the value of its common shares   groups byelaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable the effect of these provisions could be to prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future   for example groups byelaws contain the following provisions that could have an antitakeover effect          the total voting power of any shareholder owning more than 99 of the common shares will be reduced to 99 of the total voting power of the common shares              the board of directors may decline to register any transfer of common shares if it has reason to believe that the transfer would result in           i   any person that is not an investment company beneficially owning more than 50 of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group           ii   any person holding controlled shares in excess of 99 of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group or           iii   any adverse tax regulatory or legal consequences to group any of its subsidiaries or any of its shareholders              group also has the option to redeem or purchase all or part of a shareholders common shares to the extent the board of directors determines it is necessary or advisable to avoid or cure any adverse or potential adverse consequences if           i   any person that is not an investment company beneficially owns more than 50 of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group           ii   any person holds controlled shares in excess of 99 of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of group or           iii   share ownership by any person may result in adverse tax regulatory or legal consequences to group any of its subsidiaries or any other shareholder       the board of directors has indicated that it will apply these byelaw provisions in such manner that passive institutional investors will be treated similarly to investment companies for this purpose passive institutional investors include all persons who are eligible pursuant to rule 13d1b1 under the us securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act to file a shortform statement on schedule 13g other than an insurance company or any parent holding company or control person of an insurance company   applicable insurance laws may also have an antitakeover effect   before a person can acquire control of a us insurance company prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where that insurance company is domiciled or deemed commercially domiciled prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurance company a state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant the integrity and competence of the applicants board of directors and executive officers the acquirors plans for the future operations of the insurance company and any anticompetitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control because any person who acquired control of group would thereby acquire indirect control of its insurance company subsidiaries in the us the insurance change of control laws of delaware california and georgia would apply to such a transaction this could have the effect of delaying or even preventing such a change of control  34     the ownership of common shares of group by everest international reinsurance ltd everest international a direct subsidiary of group may have an impact on securing approval of shareholder proposals that groups management supports   as of december 31 2016 everest international owned 9719971 or 192 of the outstanding common shares of group under groups byelaws the total voting power of any shareholder owning more than 99 of the common shares is reduced to 99 of the total voting power of the common shares nevertheless everest international which is controlled by group has the ability to vote 99 of the total voting power of groups common shares   investors in group may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than investors in a us corporation   the companies act 1981 of bermuda the companies act differs in material respects from the laws applicable to us corporations and their shareholders the following is a summary of material differences between the companies act as modified in some instances by provisions of groups byelaws and delaware corporate law that could make it more difficult for investors in group to protect their interests than investors in a us corporation because the following statements are summaries they do not address all aspects of bermuda law that may be relevant to group and its shareholders   alternate directors groups byelaws provide as permitted by bermuda law that each director may appoint an alternate director who shall have the power to attend and vote at any meeting of the board of directors or committee at which that director is not personally present and to sign written consents in place of that director delaware law permits a director to appoint another director as an alternate to attend any board committee meeting however delaware law does not provide for the designation of alternate directors with authority to attend or vote at a meeting of the board of directors   committees of the board of directors groups byelaws provide as permitted by bermuda law that the board of directors may delegate any of its powers to committees that the board appoints and those committees may consist partly or entirely of nondirectors delaware law allows the board of directors of a corporation to delegate many of its powers to committees but those committees may consist only of directors   interested directors bermuda law and groups byelaws provide that if a director has a personal interest in a transaction to which the company is also a party and if the director discloses the nature of this personal interest at the first opportunity either at a meeting of directors or in writing to the directors then the company will not be able to declare the transaction void solely due to the existence of that personal interest and the director will not be liable to the company for any profit realized from the transaction in addition after a director has made the declaration of interest referred to above he or she is allowed to be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which he or she has an interest unless disqualified from doing so by the chairman of the relevant board meeting under delaware law an interested director could be held liable for a transaction in which that director derived an improper personal benefit additionally under delaware law a corporation may be able to declare a transaction with an interested director to be void unless one of the following conditions is fulfilled          the material facts as to the interested directors relationship or interests are disclosed or are known to the board of directors and the board in good faith authorizes the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors              the material facts are disclosed or are known to the shareholders entitled to vote on the transaction and the transaction is specifically approved in good faith by the holders of a majority of the voting shares or              the transaction is fair to the corporation as of the time it is authorized approved or ratified       transactions with significant shareholders as a bermuda company group may enter into business transactions with its significant shareholders including asset sales in which a significant shareholder receives or could receive a financial benefit that is greater than that received or to be received by other shareholders with prior approval from groups board of directors but without obtaining prior approval from the shareholders in the case of an amalgamation in which two or more companies join together and  35     continue as a single company a resolution of shareholders approved by a majority of at least 75 of the votes cast is required in addition to the approval of the board of directors except in the case of an amalgamation with and between whollyowned subsidiaries if group was a delaware corporation any business combination with an interested shareholder which for this purpose would include mergers and asset sales of greater than 10 of groups assets that would otherwise be considered transactions in the ordinary course of business within a period of three years from the time the person became an interested shareholder would require prior approval from shareholders holding at least 66 23 of groups outstanding common shares not owned by the interested shareholder unless the transaction qualified for one of the exemptions in the relevant delaware statute or group opted out of the statute for purposes of the delaware statute an interested shareholder is generally defined as a person who together with that persons affiliates and associates owns or within the previous three years did own 15 or more of a corporations outstanding voting shares   takeovers under bermuda law if an acquiror makes an offer for shares of a company and within four months of the offer the holders of not less than 90 of the shares that are the subject of the offer tender their shares the acquiror may give the nontendering shareholders notice requiring them to transfer their shares on the terms of the offer within one month of receiving the notice dissenting shareholders may apply to the court objecting to the transfer the burden is on the dissenting shareholders to show that the court should exercise its discretion to enjoin the transfer the court will be unlikely to do this unless there is evidence of fraud or bad faith or collusion between the acquiror and the tendering shareholders aimed at unfairly forcing out minority shareholders under another provision of bermuda law the holders of 95 of the shares of a company the acquiring shareholders may give notice to the remaining shareholders requiring them to sell their shares on the terms described in the notice within one month of receiving the notice dissenting shareholders may apply to the court for an appraisal of their shares within one month of the courts appraisal the acquiring shareholders are entitled either to acquire all shares involved at the price fixed by the court or cancel the notice given to the remaining shareholders if shares were acquired under the notice at a price below the courts appraisal price the acquiring shareholders must either pay the difference in price or cancel the notice and return the shares thus acquired to the shareholder who must then refund the purchase price there are no comparable provisions under delaware law   inspection of corporate records members of the general public have the right to inspect the public documents of group available at the office of the registrar of companies and groups registered office both in bermuda these documents include the memorandum of association which describes groups permitted purposes and powers any amendments to the memorandum of association and documents relating to any increase or reduction in groups authorized share capital shareholders of group have the additional right to inspect groups byelaws minutes of general meetings of shareholders and audited financial statements that must be presented to the annual general meeting of shareholders the register of shareholders of group also is open to inspection by shareholders and to members of the public without charge group is required to maintain its share register at its registered office in bermuda group also maintains a branch register in the offices of its transfer agent in the us which is open for public inspection as required under the companies act group is required to keep at its registered office a register of its directors and officers that is open for inspection by members of the public without charge however bermuda law does not provide a general right for shareholders to inspect or obtain copies of any other corporate records under delaware law any shareholder may inspect or obtain copies of a corporations shareholder list and its other books and records for any purpose reasonably related to that persons interest as a shareholder   shareholders suits the rights of shareholders under bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders under legislation or judicial precedent in many us jurisdictions class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda however the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent which would permit a shareholder to bring an action in the name of group to remedy a wrong done to group where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of group or illegal or would result in the violation of groups memorandum of association or byelaws furthermore the court would give consideration to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of groups shareholders than actually approved it the winning party in an action of this type generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action under delaware law class actions and derivative actions generally are available to stockholders for breach  36     of fiduciary duty corporate waste and actions not taken in accordance with applicable law in these types of actions the court has discretion to permit the winning party to recover its attorneys fees   limitation of liability of directors and officers groups byelaws provide that group and its shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have individually or in the right of the company against any director or officer for any act or failure to act in the performance of that directors or officers duties however this waiver does not apply to claims or rights of action that arise out of fraud or dishonesty this waiver may have the effect of barring claims arising under us federal securities laws under delaware law a corporation may include in its certificate of incorporation provisions limiting the personal liability of its directors to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for many types of breach of fiduciary duty however these provisions may not limit liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law the authorization of unlawful dividends stock repurchases or stock redemptions or any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit moreover delaware provisions would not be likely to bar claims arising under us federal securities laws   indemnification of directors and officers groups byelaws provide that group shall indemnify its directors or officers to the full extent permitted by law against all actions costs charges liabilities loss damage or expense incurred or suffered by them by reason of any act done concurred in or omitted in the conduct of groups business or in the discharge of their duties under bermuda law this indemnification may not extend to any matter involving fraud or dishonesty of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the company as determined in a final judgment or decree not subject to appeal under delaware law a corporation may indemnify a director or officer who becomes a party to an action suit or proceeding because of his position as a director or officer if 1 the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and 2 if the action or proceeding involves a criminal offense the director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful   enforcement of civil liabilities group is organized under the laws of bermuda some of its directors and officers may reside outside the us a substantial portion of our assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the us as a result a person may not be able to affect service of process within the us on directors and officers of group and those experts who reside outside the us a person also may not be able to recover against them or group on judgments of us courts or to obtain original judgments against them or group in bermuda courts including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws   dividends bermuda law does not allow a company to declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company after the payment is made would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or that the realizable value of the companys assets would be less as a result of the payment than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts the share capital account represents the aggregate par value of issued shares and the share premium account represents the aggregate amount paid for issued shares over and above their par value under delaware law subject to any restrictions contained in a companys certificate of incorporation a company may pay dividends out of the surplus or if there is no surplus out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year surplus is the amount by which the net assets of a corporation exceed its stated capital delaware law also provides that dividends may not be paid out of net profits at any time when stated capital is less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets   risks relating to taxation   if us tax law changes our net income may be impacted   for several years now some members of congress have expressed concern about us corporations that move their place of incorporation to lowtax jurisdictions as it may present a competitive advantage in comparison to domestic corporations that are subject to the us corporate tax rate of 35 also some members of congress have expressed concern over a competitive advantage that foreigncontrolled insurers and reinsurers may have over us controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the purchase of reinsurance by  37     us insurers from affiliates operating in some foreign jurisdictions including bermuda it is possible that future legislation could be enacted that seeks to mitigate these perceived tax disadvantages between us and foreign based insurers if any such legislation were enacted the us tax burden on our domestic operations or on foreign business ceded from our licensed us insurance subsidiaries to our nonus insurance subsidiaries could be impacted this would impact our net income and effective tax rate   group andor bermuda re may be subject to us corporate income tax which would reduce our net income   bermuda re the income of bermuda re is a significant portion of our worldwide income from operations we have established guidelines for the conduct of our operations that are designed to ensure that bermuda re is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the us based on its compliance with those guidelines we believe that bermuda re should not be required to pay us corporate income tax other than withholding tax on us source dividend income however if the internal revenue service irs were to successfully assert that bermuda re was engaged in a trade or business bermuda re would be required to pay us corporate income tax on all of its income and possibly the us branch profits tax however if the irs were to successfully assert that bermuda re was engaged in a us trade or business we believe the usbermuda tax treaty would preclude the irs from taxing bermuda res income except to the extent that its income was attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by that subsidiary we do not believe that bermuda re has a permanent establishment in the us if the irs were to successfully assert that bermuda re did have income attributable to a permanent establishment in the us bermuda re would be subject to us tax only on that income this would reduce our net income   group  we conduct our operations in a manner designed to minimize our us tax exposures  based on our compliance with guidelines designed to ensure that we generate only immaterial amounts if any of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us we believe that we should be required to pay only immaterial amounts if any of us corporate income tax other than withholding tax on us source dividend income however if the irs successfully asserted that we had material amounts of income that was subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the us we would be required to pay us corporate income tax on that income and possibly the us branch profits tax the imposition of such tax would reduce our net income   if bermuda re became subject to us income tax on its income or if we became subject to us income tax our income could also be subject to the us branch profits tax in that event group and bermuda re would be subject to taxation at a higher combined effective rate than if they were organized as us corporations the combined effect of the 35 us corporate income tax rate and the 30 branch profits tax rate is a net tax rate of 545 the imposition of these taxes would reduce our net income   group andor bermuda re may become subject to bermuda tax which would reduce our net income   group and bermuda re are not subject to income or profits tax withholding tax or capital gains taxes in bermuda both companies have received an assurance from the bermuda minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection amendment act of 2011 to the effect that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that imposes any tax computed on profits or income or computed on any capital asset gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax then that tax will not apply to us or to any of our operations or our shares debentures or other obligations until march 31 2035 this assurance does not prevent the application of any of those taxes to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda and does not prevent the imposition of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the land tax act 1967 of bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to any land leased to group or bermuda re   our net income will be reduced if us excise and withholding taxes are increased   bermuda re is subject to federal excise tax on reinsurance and insurance premiums with respect to risks located in the us in addition bermuda re is subject to withholding tax on dividend income from us sources these taxes could increase and other taxes could be imposed in the future on bermuda res business which would reduce our net income    38     item 1b unresolved staff comments   none   item 2 properties   everest res corporate offices are located in approximately 230500 square feet of leased office space in

ordinary course of business the company is involved in lawsuits arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute resolution procedures the outcomes of which will determine the companys rights and obligations under insurance and reinsurance agreements in some disputes the company seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or to collect funds owing to it in other matters the company is resisting attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged rights these disputes arise from time to time and are ultimately resolved through both informal and formal means including negotiated resolution arbitration and litigation in all such matters the company believes that its positions are legally and commercially reasonable the company considers the statuses of these proceedings when determining its reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses   aside from litigation and arbitrations related to these insurance and reinsurance agreements the company is not a party to any

should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto presented under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data   industry conditions the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive as well as cyclical by product and market as such financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of constrained availability higher rates and stronger profits followed by periods of abundant capacity lower rates and constrained profitability competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that we underwrite is based on many factors including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by am best andor standard amp poors underwriting expertise the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized capacity and coverages offered premiums charged other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered services offered speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written furthermore the market impact from these competitive factors related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels   we compete in the us bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies domestic and international underwriting operations including underwriting syndicates at lloyds of london and certain government sponsored risk transfer vehicles some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have established long term and continuing business relationships which can be a significant competitive advantage in addition the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and recently the securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition   worldwide insurance and reinsurance market conditions continued to be very competitive particularly in the property catastrophe and casualty reinsurance lines of business generally there was ample insurance and reinsurance capacity relative to demand as well as additional capital from the capital markets through insurance linked financial instruments these financial instruments such as side cars catastrophe bonds and collateralized reinsurance funds provide capital markets with access to insurance and reinsurance risk exposure the capital markets demand for these products is being primarily driven by the current low interest environment and the desire to achieve greater risk diversification and potentially higher returns on their investments this increased competition is generally having a negative impact on rates terms and conditions however the impact varies widely by market and coverage   rates tend to fluctuate by specific region and products particularly areas recently impacted by large catastrophic events although there were flooding and wind storm events and earthquakes in parts of the world the overall 2013 2014 and 2015 catastrophe losses for the industry were considerably lower than average during 2016 there was an increase in catastrophes the fort mcmurray canadian wildfire hurricane matthew which affected a large area of the caribbean and southeastern united states storms and an earthquake in ecuador there are industry predictions that the catastrophe losses for 2016 may exceed the inflationadjusted ten year average catastrophe amounts while the future impact on market conditions from these catastrophes cannot be determined at this time it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall markets but may impact loss affected areas   commencing in 2015 we initiated a strategic build out of our insurance platform through the investment in key leadership hires which in turn has brought significant underwriting talent and stronger direction in achieving our insurance program strategic goals of increased premium volume and improved underwriting results recent growth is coming from highly diversified areas including newly launched lines of business as well as product and geographic expansion in existing lines of business we are building a worldclass insurance platform capable of offering products across lines and geographies complementing our leading global reinsurance franchise as part of this initiative we received approval from lloyds of london to launch  43     a new syndicate in 2016 which provided us access to additional international business and new product opportunities to further diversify and broaden our insurance portfolio   overall we believe that given our size strong ratings distribution system reputation expertise and capital market vehicle activity the current marketplace conditions provide profit opportunities we continue to employ our strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit potential while maintaining balance and diversification in our overall portfolio   financial summary we monitor

million or 166 increase in our insurance business partially offset by a 1126 million or 26 decrease in our reinsurance business the rise in insurance premiums was primarily due to increases in most

change in premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of the

and yield was primarily the result of lower reinvestment rates for the fixed income portfolios and lower dividends from equity securities partially offset by higher income from our limited

assets was 29 in 2015 compared to 33 in 2014 the decline in income and yield was primarily the result of lower reinvestment rates for the fixed income portfolios and a decrease in our limited

 net derivative gain loss in 2005 and prior we sold seven equity index put option contracts which remain outstanding these contracts meet the definition of a derivative in accordance with fasb guidance and as such are fair valued each quarter with the change recorded as net derivative gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss as a result of these adjustments in value we recognized net derivative gains of 186 million and 63 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively and a net derivative loss of 116 million in 2014 the change in the fair value of these equity index put option contracts is indicative of the change in the equity markets and interest rates over the same periods   other income expense we recorded other expense of 106 million in 2016 and we recorded other income of 883 million and 323 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively the changes were primarily the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the

13259 million in 2015 the difference between the change in gross written premiums compared to the change in net written premiums is primarily due to the transfer of the crop business to the us reinsurance segment as a result of the heartland sale premiums earned increased 19 to 12912 million in 2016 compared to 12667 million in 2015 the change in premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of the coverage period   gross written premiums increased by 258 to 15323 million in 2015 compared to 12184 million in 2014 this increase was primarily driven by an increase in various lines of business as the company looked to expand its insurance operations net written premiums increased by 242 to 13259 million in 2015 compared to 10673 million in 2014 which is consistent with the change in gross written premiums premiums earned increased 229

hires    59     critical accounting policies   the following is a summary of the critical accounting policies related to accounting estimates that 1 require management to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters and 2 could materially impact the consolidated financial statements if management made different assumptions   loss and lae reserves our most critical accounting policy is the determination of our loss and lae reserves we maintain reserves equal to our estimated ultimate liability for losses and lae for reported and unreported claims for our insurance and reinsurance businesses because reserves are based on estimates of ultimate losses and lae by underwriting or accident year we use a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to monitor reserve adequacy over time evaluate new information as it becomes known and adjust reserves whenever an adjustment appears warranted we consider many factors when setting reserves including 1 our exposure base and projected ultimate premiums earned 2 our expected loss ratios by product and class of business which are developed collaboratively by underwriters and actuaries 3 actuarial methodologies which analyze our loss reporting and payment experience reports from ceding companies and historical trends such as reserving patterns loss payments and product mix 4 current legal interpretations of coverage and liability 5 economic conditions and 6 uncertainties discussed below regarding our liability for aampe claims our insurance and reinsurance loss and lae reserves represent managements best estimate of our ultimate liability actual losses and lae ultimately paid may deviate perhaps substantially from such reserves our net income loss will be impacted in a period in which the change in estimated ultimate losses and lae is recorded see also item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements   it is more difficult to accurately estimate loss reserves for reinsurance liabilities than for insurance liabilities at december 31 2016 we had reinsurance reserves of 72957 million and insurance loss reserves of 30166 million of which 3319 million and 1092 million respectively were loss reserves for aampe liabilities a detailed discussion of additional considerations related to aampe exposures follows later in this section   the detailed data required to evaluate ultimate losses for our insurance business is accumulated from our underwriting and claim systems reserving for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from ceding companies ceding companies report losses to us in many forms dependent on the type of contract and the agreed or contractual reporting requirements generally proportionalquota share contracts require the submission of a monthlyquarterly account which includes premium and loss activity for the period with corresponding reserves as established by the ceding company this information is recorded into our records for certain proportional contracts we may require a detailed loss report for claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold or relate to a particular type of loss excess of loss and facultative contracts generally require individual loss reporting with precautionary notices provided when a loss reaches a significant percentage of the attachment point of the contract or when certain causes of loss or types of injury occur our experienced claims staff handles individual loss reports and supporting claim information based on our evaluation of a claim we may establish additional case reserves acrs in addition to the case reserves reported by the ceding company to ensure ceding companies are submitting required and accurate data the underwriting claim reinsurance accounting and internal audit departments of the company perform various reviews of our ceding companies particularly larger ceding companies including onsite audits   we sort both our reinsurance and insurance reserves into exposure groupings for actuarial analysis we assign our business to exposure groupings so that the underlying exposures have reasonably homogeneous loss development characteristics and are large enough to facilitate credible estimation of ultimate losses we periodically review our exposure groupings and we may change our groupings over time as our business changes we currently use over 200 exposure groupings to develop our reserve estimates one of the key selection characteristics for the exposure groupings is the historical duration of the claims settlement process business in which claims are reported and settled relatively quickly are commonly referred to as short tail lines principally property lines on the other hand casualty claims tend to take longer to be reported and settled and casualty lines are generally referred to as long tail lines our estimates of ultimate losses for shorter tail lines with the exception of loss estimates for large catastrophic events generally exhibit less volatility than those for the longer tail lines  60     we use similar actuarial methodologies such as expected loss ratio chain ladder reserving methods and borhuetter ferguson supplemented by judgment where appropriate to estimate our ultimate losses and lae for each exposure group although we use similar actuarial methodologies for both short tail and long tail lines the faster reporting of experience for the short tail lines allows us to have greater confidence in our estimates of ultimate losses for short tail lines at an earlier stage than for long tail lines as a result we utilize as well exposurebased methods to estimate our ultimate losses for longer tail lines especially for immature accident years for both short and long tail lines we supplement these general approaches with analytically based judgments we cannot estimate losses from widespread catastrophic events such as hurricanes and earthquakes using traditional actuarial methods we estimate losses for these types of events based on information derived from catastrophe models quantitative and qualitative exposure analyses reports and communications from ceding companies and development patterns for historically similar events due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating such losses these estimates are subject to variability which increases with the severity and complexity of the underlying event   our key actuarial assumptions contain no explicit provisions for reserve uncertainty nor do we supplement the actuarially determined reserves for uncertainty   our carried reserves at each reporting date are managements best estimate of ultimate unpaid losses and lae at that date we complete detailed reserve studies for each exposure group annually for our reinsurance and insurance operations the completed annual reinsurance reserve studies are rolled forward for each accounting period until the subsequent reserve study is completed analyzing the rollforward process involves comparing actual reported losses to expected losses based on the most recent reserve study we analyze significant variances between actual and expected losses and also consider recent market underwriting and management criteria to determine managements best estimate of ultimate unpaid losses and lae as a result of these additional factors in some instances the selected reserve level may be higher or lower than the actuarial indicated estimate   given the inherent variability in our loss reserves we have developed an estimated range of possible gross reserve levels a table of ranges by segment accompanied by commentary on potential and historical variability is included in financial condition  loss and lae reserves the ranges are statistically developed using the exposure groups used in the reserve estimation process and aggregated to the segment level for each exposure group our actuaries calculate a range for each accident year based principally on two variables the first is the historical changes in losses and lae incurred but not reported ibnr for each accident year over time the second is volatility of each accident years held reserves related to estimated ultimate losses also over time both are measured at various ages from the end of the accident year through the final payout of the years losses ranges are developed for the exposure groups using statistical methods to adjust for diversification the ranges for the exposure groups are aggregated to the segment level likewise with an adjustment for diversification our estimates of our reserve variability may not be comparable to those of other companies because there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations our recorded reserves reflect our best point estimate of our liabilities and our actuarial methodologies focus on developing such point estimates we calculate the ranges subsequently based on the historical variability of such reserves   asbestos and environmental exposures we continue to receive claims under expired insurance and reinsurance contracts asserting injuries andor damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances including asbestos environmental claims typically assert liability for a the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or b bodily injury or property damage caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land air or water asbestos claims typically assert liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos   our reserves include an estimate of our ultimate liability for aampe claims our aampe liabilities emanate from everest res assumed reinsurance business liabilities related to mt mckinleys direct business which had been ceded to bermuda re previously were retroceded to an affiliate of clearwater insurance company in july 2015 concurrent with the sale of mt mckinley to clearwater insurance company there are significant uncertainties surrounding our estimates of our potential losses from aampe claims among the uncertainties are a potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage b difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or environmental contamination c difficulty in  61     properly allocating responsibility andor liability for asbestos or environmental damage d changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws e the potential for an asbestos or environmental claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods f questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage and g uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental exposure   due to the uncertainties discussed above the ultimate losses attributable to aampe and particularly asbestos may be subject to more variability than are nonaampe reserves and such variation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations andor cash flows see also item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes 1 and 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements   reinsurance receivables we have purchased reinsurance to reduce our exposure to adverse claim experience large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences our ceded reinsurance provides for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances such reinsurance does not relieve us of our obligation to our policyholders in the event our reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations under these agreements or are able to successfully challenge losses ceded by us under the contracts we will not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance receivable balance to minimize exposure from uncollectible reinsurance receivables we have a reinsurance security committee that evaluates the financial strength of each reinsurer prior to our entering into a reinsurance arrangement in some cases we may hold full or partial collateral for the receivable including letters of credit trust assets and cash additionally creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business written in the us as well as capital markets reinsurance mechanisms are generally required to secure their obligations we have established reserves for uncollectible balances based on our assessment of the collectability of the outstanding balances as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the reserve for uncollectible balances was 150 million actual uncollectible amounts may vary perhaps substantially from such reserves impacting income loss in the period in which the change in reserves is made see also item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 11 of notes to the consolidated financial statements and financial condition  reinsurance receivables below   premiums written and earned premiums written by us are earned ratably over the coverage periods of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts we establish unearned premium reserves to cover the unexpired portion of each contract such reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data received from ceding companies premiums earned and the related costs which have not yet been reported to us are estimated and accrued because of the inherent lag in the reporting of written and earned premiums by our ceding companies we use standard accepted actuarial methodologies to estimate earned but not reported premium at each financial reporting date these earned but not

of our commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs are valued using cash flow models and riskadjusted discount rates we hold some privately placed securities less than 05 of the portfolio that are either valued by brokers or an investment advisor or in limited circumstances when broker prices are not available for private placement we will value the securities using comparable market information at december 31 2016 and 2015 our investment portfolio included 9170 million and 7655 million respectively of limited partnership investments whose values are reported pursuant to the equity method of accounting we carry these investments at values provided by the managements of the limited partnerships and due to inherent reporting lags the carrying values are based on values with as of dates from one month to one quarter prior to our financial statement date   at december 31 2016 we had net unrealized gains net of tax of 1156 million compared to 428 million at december 31 2015

for investments held at fair value are reflected as net realized capital gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss market value declines for the fixed income portfolio which are considered credit otherthantemporary impairments are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss as realized capital losses we

concluded that the decline in value was temporary see also item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements   financial condition   cash and invested assets aggregate invested assets including cash and shortterm investments were 174831 million at december 31 2016 an increase of 8067 million compared to 166764 million at december 31 2015 this increase was primarily the result of 13730 million of cash flows from operations 966 million of pretax unrealized appreciation 379 million in equity adjustments of our limited partnership

ensure funds are available to meet our insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize aftertax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio considering these objectives we view our investment portfolio as having two components 1 the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities our core fixed maturities portfolio and 2 investments funded by our shareholders equity   for the portion needed to satisfy global outstanding liabilities we generally invest in taxable and taxpreferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of aa3 for the us portion of this portfolio our mix of taxable and taxpreferenced investments is adjusted periodically consistent with our current and projected us operating results market conditions and our tax position this global fixed maturity securities portfolio is externally managed by an independent professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by internal management    63     over the past several years we have expanded the allocation of our investments funded by shareholders equity to include 1 a greater percentage of publicly traded equity securities 2 emerging market fixed maturities through mutual fund structures as well as individual holdings 3 high yield fixed maturities 4 bank loan securities and 5 private equity limited partnership investments the objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the riskadjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes which are also less subject to changes in value with movements in interest rates we limit our allocation to these asset classes because of 1 the potential for volatility in their values and 2 the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models we use investment managers experienced in these markets and adjust our allocation to these investments based upon market conditions at december 31 2016 the market value of investments in these investment market sectors carried at both market and fair value approximated 50 of shareholders equity   the companys limited partnership investments are comprised of limited partnerships that invest in private equities generally the limited partnerships are reported on a quarter lag we receive annual audited financial statements for all of the limited partnerships which are prepared using fair value accounting in accordance with fasb guidance for the quarterly reports the companys staff performs reviews of the financial reports for any unusual changes in carrying value if the company becomes aware of a significant decline in value during the lag reporting period the loss will be recorded in the

and lae reserves by segment and in total   our loss and lae reserves represent managements best estimate of our ultimate liability for unpaid claims we continuously reevaluate our reserves including reestimates of prior period reserves taking into consideration all available information and in particular newly reported loss and claim experience changes in reserves resulting from such reevaluations are reflected in incurred losses in the period when the reevaluation is made our analytical methods and processes operate at multiple levels including individual contracts groupings of like contracts classes and lines of business internal business units segments legal entities and in the aggregate in order to set appropriate reserves we make qualitative and quantitative analyses and judgments at these various levels additionally the attribution of reserves changes in reserves and incurred losses among accident years requires qualitative and quantitative adjustments and allocations at these various levels we utilize actuarial science business expertise and management judgment in a manner intended to ensure the accuracy and consistency of our reserving practices nevertheless our reserves are estimates which are subject to variation which may be significant   there can be no assurance that reserves for and losses from claim obligations will not increase in the future possibly by a material amount however we believe that our existing reserves and reserving methodologies lessen the probability that any such increase would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows    65     we have included ranges for loss reserve estimates determined by our actuaries which have been developed through a combination of objective and subjective criteria our presentation of this information may not be directly comparable to similar presentations of other companies as there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations our recorded reserves are an aggregation of our best point estimates for approximately 200 reserve groups and reflect our best point estimate of our liabilities our actuarial methodologies develop point estimates rather than ranges and the ranges are developed subsequently based upon historical and prospective variability measures   the following

amounts it should be noted that statistically the range of the total is not equal to the sum of the ranges of the segments       depending on the specific segment the range derived for the loss reserves excluding reserves for aampe exposures ranges from minus 101 to minus 188 for the low range and from plus 101 to plus 188 for the high range both the higher and lower ranges are associated with the insurance segment the size of the range is dependent upon the level of confidence associated with the outcome within each range managements best estimate of loss reserves is based upon the point estimate derived by our actuaries in detailed reserve studies such ranges are necessarily subjective due to the lack of generally accepted actuarial standards with respect to their development for the above presentation we have assumed what we believe is a reasonable confidence level but note that there can be no assurance that our claim obligations will not vary outside of these ranges   additional losses including those relating to latent injuries and other exposures which are as yet unrecognized the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by us or the reinsurance and insurance industry generally may emerge in the future such future emergence to the extent not covered by existing retrocessional contracts could have material adverse effects on our future financial condition results of operations and cash flows   asbestos and environmental exposures aampe exposures represent a separate exposure group for monitoring and evaluating reserve adequacy the following table summarizes the outstanding loss reserves with respect to aampe reserves on both a gross and net of retrocessions basis for the periods indicated          years ended december 31       dollars in

asbestos loss reserves of 3036 million or 952 of total net aampe reserves all of which was for assumed business  66     on july 13 2015 we sold mt mckinley to clearwater insurance company concurrently with the closing we entered into a retrocession treaty with an affiliate of clearwater per the retrocession treaty we retroceded 100 of the liabilities associated with certain mt mckinley policies which had been reinsured by bermuda re as consideration for entering into the retrocession treaty bermuda re transferred cash of 1403 million an amount equal to the net loss reserves as of the closing date of the 1403 million of net loss reserves retroceded 1005 million were related to aampe business the maximum liability retroceded under the retrocession treaty will be 4403 million equal to the retrocession payment plus 3000 million we will retain liability for any amounts exceeding the maximum liability retroceded under the retrocession treaty   ultimate loss projections for aampe liabilities cannot be accomplished using standard actuarial techniques we believe that our aampe reserves represent managements best estimate of the ultimate liability however there can be no assurance that ultimate loss payments will not exceed such reserves perhaps by a significant amount   industry analysts use the survival ratio to compare the aampe reserves among companies with such liabilities the survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a companys current net reserves by the three year average of annual paid losses hence the survival ratio equals the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves if future loss payments were to continue at historical levels using this measurement our net three year asbestos survival ratio was 54 years at december 31 2016 these metrics can be skewed by individual large settlements occurring in the prior three years and therefore may not be indicative of the timing of future payments   shareholders equity our shareholders equity increased to 80754 million as of december 31 2016 from 76086 million as of december 31 2015 this increase was the result of 9963 million of net income 727 million of unrealized appreciation on investments net of tax and 371 million of sharebased compensation transactions partially offset by repurchases of 21 million common shares for 3863 million 1954 million of shareholder dividends 553 million of net foreign currency translation adjustments and 24 million of net benefit plan obligation adjustments   our shareholders equity increased to 76086 million as of december 31 2015 from 74511 million as of december 31 2014 this increase was the result of 9779 million of net income sharebased compensation transactions of 348 million and 119 million of net benefit plan obligation adjustments partially offset by repurchases of 23 million common shares for 4001 million 1804 million of unrealized depreciation on investments net of tax 1751 million of shareholder dividends and 1115 million of net foreign currency translation adjustments   liquidity and capital resources   capital shareholders equity at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 was 80754 million and 76086 million respectively managements objective in managing capital is to ensure its overall capital level as well as the capital levels of its operating subsidiaries exceed the amounts required by regulators the amount needed to support our current financial strength ratings from rating agencies and our own economic capital models the companys capital has historically exceeded these benchmark levels   our two main operating companies bermuda re and everest re are regulated by the bermuda monetary authority bma and the state of delaware department of insurance respectively both regulatory bodies have their own capital adequacy models based on statutory capital as opposed to gaap basis equity failure to meet the required statutory capital levels could result in various regulatory restrictions including business activity and the payment of dividends to their parent companies    67     the regulatory targeted capital and the actual statutory capital for bermuda re and everest re were as follows          bermuda re 1       everest re 2           at december 31       at december 31       dollars in millions     2016 3       2015 3       2016       2015

represents the target capital level from the applicable years bscr calculation 2 regulatory targeted capital represents 200 of the rbc authorized control level calculation for the applicable year 3 the 2016 bscr calculation is not yet due to be completed however the company anticipates that bermuda res december 31 2016 actual capital will exceed the targeted capital level   our financial strength ratings as determined by am best standard amp poors and moodys are important as they provide our customers and investors with an independent assessment of our financial strength using a rating scale that provides for relative comparisons we continue to possess significant financial flexibility and access to debt and equity markets as a result of our financial strength as evidenced by the financial strength ratings as assigned by independent rating agencies see also item 1 business  financial strength ratings   we maintain our own economic capital models to monitor and project our overall capital as well as the capital at our operating subsidiaries a key input to the economic models is projected income and this input is continually compared to actual results which may require a change in the capital strategy for example if catastrophe losses are higher than expected we may scale back our share buybacks to offset the impact on capital from the reduced income   during 2016 we repurchased 21 million shares for 3863 million in the open market and paid 1954 million in dividends to adjust our capital position and enhance long term expected returns to our shareholders during 2015 we repurchased 23 million shares for 4001 million in the open market and paid 1751 million in dividends we may at times enter into a rule 10b51 repurchase plan agreement to facilitate the repurchase of shares on november 19 2014 our existing board authorization to purchase up to 25 million of our shares was amended to authorize the purchase of up to 30 million shares as of december 31 2016 we had repurchased 280 million shares under this authorization   during 2014 the company issued 4000 million of senior notes at an attractive interest rate during this low interest rate environment and used 2500 million of the proceeds for maturing senior notes the balance of the proceeds will be used for other operating purposes the senior notes qualify as capital for the rating agency models   on july 9 2014 we renewed our shelf registration statement on form s3asr with the securities and exchange commission sec as a well known seasoned issuer this shelf registration statement can be used by group to register common shares preferred shares debt securities warrants share purchase contracts and share purchase units by holdings to register debt securities and by everest re capital trust iii capital trust iii to register trust preferred securities   liquidity our liquidity requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations positive cash flow results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for claims which disbursements generally take place over an extended period after the collection of premiums sometimes a period of many years collected premiums are generally invested prior to their use in such disbursements and investment income provides additional funding for loss payments our net cash flows from operating activities were 13730 million 10966 million and 10548 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively additionally these cash flows reflected net tax payments of 426 million 1649 million and 1535 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively and net catastrophe loss payments of 2060 million 1677 million and 3180 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively   if disbursements for claims and benefits policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses were to exceed premium inflows cash flow from reinsurance and insurance operations would be negative the  68     effect on cash flow from insurance operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income additionally cash inflows from investment maturities and dispositions both shortterm investments and longer term maturities are available to supplement other operating cash flows   as the timing of payments for claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty we maintain portfolios of long term invested assets with varying maturities along with shortterm investments that provide additional liquidity for payment of claims at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 we held cash and shortterm investments of 9134 million and 10833 million respectively all of our shortterm investments are readily marketable and can be converted to cash starting in the first quarter of 2016 we implemented a new liquidity sweep facility with investments in short maturity investment grade us dollar denominated fixed income securities the facility is structured as a limited liability corporation so it is classified on our balance sheet as part of other invested assets this facility had 3789 million of available liquidity at december 31 2016 in addition to these cash and shortterm investments at december 31 2016 we had 9670 million of available for sale fixed maturity securities maturing within one year or less 68701 million maturing within one to five years and 30687 million maturing after five years our 11292 million of equity securities are comprised primarily of publicly traded securities that can be easily liquidated we believe that these fixed maturity and equity securities in conjunction with the shortterm investments and positive cash flow from operations provide ample sources of liquidity for the expected payment of losses in the near future we do not anticipate selling securities or using available credit facilities to pay losses and lae but have the ability to do so sales of securities might result in realized capital gains or losses at december 31 2016 we had 1643 million of net pretax unrealized appreciation comprised of 3849 million of pretax unrealized appreciation and 2206 million of pretax unrealized depreciation   management expects annual positive cash flow from operations which in general reflects the strength of overall pricing to persist over the near term absent any unusual catastrophe activity in the intermediate and long term our cash flow from operations will be impacted to the extent by which competitive pressures affect overall pricing in our markets and by which our premium receipts are impacted from our strategy of emphasizing underwriting profitability over premium volume   in addition to our cash flows from operations and liquid investments we also have multiple credit facilities that provide up to 2000 million of unsecured revolving credit for liquidity but more importantly provide for up to 6000 million and 1400 million of collateralized standby letters of credit to support business written by our bermuda operating subsidiaries   effective may 26 2016 group bermuda re and everest international entered into a five year 8000 million senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders which amended and restated in its entirety the june 22 2012 four year 8000 million senior credit facility both the may 26 2016 and june

1650 million outstanding letters of credit respectively   costs incurred in connection with the group credit facility and everest international credit facility were 08 million for december 31 2016 and 2015   exposure to catastrophes like other insurance and reinsurance companies we are exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence whether a natural event such as a hurricane or an earthquake or other catastrophe such as an explosion at a major factory a large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties facultative certificates and direct insurance policies across various lines of business   we focus on potential losses that could result from any single event or series of events as part of our evaluation and monitoring of our aggregate exposures to catastrophic events accordingly we employ various techniques to estimate the amount of loss we could sustain from any single catastrophic event or series of events in various geographic areas these techniques range from deterministic approaches such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastropheprone zones and applying reasonable damage factors to modeled approaches that attempt to scientifically measure catastrophe loss exposure using sophisticated monte carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of potential losses on a probabilistic basis   no single universal model or group of models is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which we conduct business in addition the form quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for our licensed models which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections further the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined to estimate potential losses by and across business units also while most models have been updated to incorporate claims information from recent catastrophic events catastrophe model projections are still inherently imprecise in addition uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles could add further uncertainty to loss projections from models based on historical data   nevertheless when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events  70     projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the pml we define pml as our anticipated loss taking into account contract terms and limits caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake the pml will vary depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the makeup of the in force book of business the projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods such as 100year events and 250year events for example a 100year pml is the estimated loss to the current inforce portfolio from a single event which has a 1 probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period in other words it corresponds to a 99 probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated pml it is important to note that pmls are estimates modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model as a result there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event pml   from an enterprise risk management perspective management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure we may underwrite the limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors including but not limited to our financial resources and expected earnings and riskreward analyses of the business being underwritten   management estimates that the projected net economic loss from its largest 100year event in a given zone represents approximately 11 of its december 31 2016 shareholders equity economic loss is the pml exposure net of third party reinsurance reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and estimated income taxes the impact of income taxes on the pml depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity which is also affected by interaffiliate reinsurance management also monitors and controls its largest pmls at multiple points along the loss distribution curve such as loss amounts at the 20 50 100 250 500 and 1000 year return periods this process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk underwriting and capital management decisions   our catastrophe loss projections segmented by risk zones are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process   we believe that our greatest worldwide 1 in 100 year exposure to a single catastrophic event is to a hurricane affecting the us southeast coast where we estimate we have a pml exposure net of third party reinsurance of 15440 million see also table under item 1 business  risk management of underwriting and retrocession arrangements   if such a single catastrophe loss were to occur management estimates that the economic loss to us would be approximately 9210 million the estimate involves multiple variables including which everest entity would experience the loss and as a result there can be no assurance that this amount would not be exceeded   we may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of our operations reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing terms conditions and availability of coverage with the aim of securing cost effective protection the amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time reflecting our view of our exposures and the cost of reinsurance   information technology our information technology is a key component of our business operations and is supported by a team of knowledgeable professionals the majority of our information technology platform is located at our service processing center in new jersey but processing is performed at the office locations of our operating subsidiaries and branches in addition our mainframe processing is performed by a third party vendor at a separate

statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments derivative commodity instruments and other financial instruments collectively market sensitive instruments we do not generally enter into market sensitive instruments for trading purposes   our current investment strategy seeks to maximize aftertax income through a high quality diversified taxable and taxpreferenced fixed maturity portfolio while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity our mix of taxable and taxpreferenced investments is adjusted periodically consistent with our current and projected operating results market conditions and our tax position the fixed maturity securities in the investment portfolio are comprised of nontrading available for sale securities additionally we have invested in equity securities   the overall investment strategy considers the scope of present and anticipated company operations in particular estimates of the financial impact resulting from noninvestment asset and liability transactions together with our capital structure and other factors are used to develop a net liability analysis this analysis includes estimated payout characteristics for which our investments provide liquidity this analysis is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation duration and credit quality the change in overall market sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period   interest rate risk our 175 billion investment portfolio at december 31 2016 is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities which are generally subject to interest rate risk and some foreign currency exchange rate risk and some equity securities which are subject to price fluctuations and some foreign exchange rate risk the overall economic impact of the foreign exchange risks on the investment portfolio is partially mitigated by changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated liabilities and their associated income statement impact    75     interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity securities portfolio including shortterm investments from a change in market interest rates in a declining interest rate environment it includes prepayment risk on the 27130 million of mortgagebacked securities in the 141074 million fixed maturity portfolio prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the security   the tables below display the potential impact of market value fluctuations and aftertax unrealized appreciation on our fixed maturity portfolio including 4315 million of shortterm investments for the period indicated based on upward and downward parallel and immediate 100 and 200 basis point shifts in interest rates for legal entities with a us dollar functional currency this modeling was performed on each security individually to generate appropriate price estimates on mortgagebacked securities changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments were taken into account for legal entities with a nonus dollar functional currency the effective duration of the involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the market value change under the various interest rate change scenarios          impact of

and 99518 million of gross reserves for losses and lae as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively these amounts are recorded at their nominal value as opposed to present value which would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the time value of money since losses are paid out over a period of time the present value of the reserves is less than the nominal value as interest rates rise the present value of the reserves decreases and conversely as interest rates decline the present value increases these movements are the opposite of the interest rate impacts on the fair value of investments while the difference between present value and nominal value is not reflected in our financial statements our financial results will include investment income over time from the investment portfolio until the claims are paid our loss and loss reserve obligations have an expected duration of approximately 42 years which is reasonably consistent with our fixed income portfolio if we were to discount our loss and lae reserves net of ceded reserves the discount would be approximately 12 billion resulting in a discounted reserve balance of approximately 81 billion representing

each of our nonusbermuda foreign operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines each foreign operation may conduct business in its local currency as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates the primary foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are the canadian dollar the singapore dollar the british pound sterling and the euro we mitigate foreign exchange exposure by generally matching the currency and duration of our assets to our corresponding operating liabilities in accordance with fasb guidance the impact on the market value of available for sale fixed maturities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to functional currency is reflected as part of other comprehensive income conversely the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to functional currency on other assets and liabilities is reflected through net

reported as a component of other comprehensive income   in june 2016 the united kingdom approved a referendum to exit the european union commonly referred to as brexit which resulted in volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates and has increased political economic and global market uncertainty the formal process for the united kingdom to exit the european union would ultimately be triggered by the filing of a notice to withdraw and thereafter negotiations would occur as to the timing and terms of such an exit the company has a lloyds of london syndicate and

attention on securities whose fair value has fallen below 80 of their amortized cost at the time of review the company then assesses whether the decline in value is temporary or otherthantemporary in making its assessment the company evaluates the current market and interest rate environment as well as specific issuer information generally a change in a securitys value caused by a change in the market interest rate or foreign exchange environment does not constitute an otherthantemporary impairment but rather a temporary decline in market value temporary declines in market value are recorded as unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss if the company determines that the decline is otherthantemporary and the company does not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the company will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value the fair value adjustment that is credit or foreign exchange related is recorded in net realized capital gains losses in the companys consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss the fair value adjustment that is noncredit related is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss net of tax and is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the companys consolidated balance sheets   the companys assessments are based on the issuers current and expected future financial position timeliness with respect to interest andor principal payments speed of repayments and any applicable credit enhancements or breakeven constant default rates on mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities as well as relevant information provided by rating agencies investment advisors and analysts    f17     the majority of the companys equity securities available for sale at market value are primarily comprised of mutual fund investments whose underlying securities consist of fixed maturity securities when a funds value reflects an unrealized loss the company assesses whether the decline in value is temporary or otherthantemporary in making its assessment the company considers the composition of its portfolios and their related markets reports received from the portfolio managers and discussions with portfolio managers if the company determines that the declines are temporary and it has the ability and intent to continue to hold the investments then the declines are recorded as unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss if declines are deemed to be otherthantemporary then the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value and recorded in net realized capital gains losses in the companys consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss   retrospective adjustments are employed to recalculate the values of assetbacked securities all of the companys assetbacked and mortgagebacked securities have a passthrough structure each acquisition lot is reviewed to recalculate the effective yield the recalculated effective yield is used to derive a book value as if the new yield were applied at the time of acquisition outstanding principal factors from the time of acquisition to the adjustment date are used to calculate the prepayment history for all applicable securities conditional prepayment rates computed with life to date factor histories and weighted average maturities are used in the calculation of projected prepayments for passthrough security types

not reported liabilities ibnr plus expected development on reported claims included within the net incurred claims amounts each of the companys financial reporting segments has been disaggregated into casualty and property business the casualty and property segregation results in groups that have homogeneous loss development characteristics and are large enough to represent credible trends generally casualty claims take longer to be reported and settled resulting in longer payout patterns and increased volatility property claims on the other hand tend to be reported and settled quicker and therefore tend to exhibit less volatility the property business is more exposed to catastrophe losses which can result in year over year fluctuations in incurred claims depending on the frequency and severity of catastrophes claims in any one accident year  f22     the information about incurred and paid claims development for the years ended december 31 2012 to december 31 2015 is presented as supplementary information   these tables present five years of incurred and paid claims development as it is impracticable to retrospectively create the tables for ten years for the reinsurance groups for the years prior to 2012 the total of ibnr plus expected development on reported claims was not prepared on an accident year basis the company calculated these ibnr amounts in the aggregate for each business unit in total as of prior year end points in time while business written in the united states would have been allocated to accident year for regulatory reporting purposes business written outside of the united states would not have been similarly allocated attempting to allocate the nonus business ibnr reserves to accident year currently for older year end valuations would require making assumptions and estimates which may not be in line with assumptions that would have been made at the time a similar situation applies to insurance where the accumulation of the business lines reported in the regulatory filings are not consistent with the breakout of the tables presented below as a result of not being able to present the information prior to 2012 prospectively an additional year will be added to the tables each reporting year until a ten year table is presented   the cumulative number of reported claims is shown only for insurance casualty as it is impracticable to provide the information for the remaining groups the reinsurance groups each include pro rata contracts for which ceding companies provide only summary information via a bordereau this summary information does not include the number of reported claims underlying the paid and reported losses therefore it is not possible to provide this information the insurance property group includes accident amp health insurance business this business is written via a master contract and individual claim counts are not provided this business represents a significant enough portion of the business in the insurance property group so that including the number of reported claims for the remaining business would distort any analytics performed on the group   the cumulative number of reported claims shown for the insurance casualty is determined by claim and line of business for example a claim event with three claimants in the same line of business is a single claim however a claim event with a single claimant that spans two lines of business contributes two claims    f23     the following tables present the ultimate loss and alae and the paid loss and alae net of

maintains reserves equal to our estimated ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expense lae for reported and unreported claims for our insurance and reinsurance businesses because reserves are based on estimates of ultimate losses and lae by underwriting or accident year the company uses a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to monitor reserve adequacy over time evaluate new information as it becomes known and adjust reserves whenever an adjustment appears warranted the company considers many factors when setting reserves including 1 exposure base and projected ultimate premium 2 expected loss ratios by product and class of business which are developed collaboratively by underwriters and actuaries 3 actuarial methodologies which analyze loss reporting and payment experience reports from ceding companies and historical trends such as reserving patterns loss payments and product mix 4 current legal interpretations of coverage and liability and 5 economic conditions insurance and reinsurance loss and lae reserves represent the companys best estimate of its ultimate liability actual loss and lae ultimately paid may deviate perhaps substantially from such reserves net income gain or loss will be impacted in a period in which the change in estimated ultimate loss and lae is recorded   the detailed data required to evaluate ultimate losses for the companys insurance business is accumulated from its underwriting and claim systems reserving for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from ceding companies ceding companies report losses in many forms depending on the type of contract and the agreed or contractual reporting requirements generally pro rata contracts require the   f32     submission of a monthlyquarterly account which includes premium and loss activity for the period with corresponding reserves as established by the ceding company this information is recorded into the companys records for certain pro rata contracts the company may require a detailed loss report for claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold or relate to a particular type of loss excess of loss and facultative contracts generally require individual loss reporting with precautionary notices provided when a loss reaches a significant percentage of the attachment point of the contract or when certain causes of loss or types of injury occur experienced claims staff handles individual loss reports and supporting claim information based on evaluation of a claim the company may establish additional case reserves in addition to the case reserves reported by the ceding company to ensure ceding companies are submitting required and accurate data everests underwriting claim reinsurance accounting and internal audit departments perform various reviews of ceding companies particularly larger ceding companies including onsite audits   the company segments both reinsurance and insurance reserves into exposure groupings for actuarial analysis the company assigns business to exposure groupings so that the underlying exposures have reasonably homogeneous loss development characteristics and are large enough to facilitate credible estimation of ultimate losses the company periodically reviews its exposure groupings and may change groupings over time as business changes the company currently uses approximately 200 exposure groupings to develop reserve estimates one of the key selection characteristics for the exposure groupings is the historical duration of the claims settlement process business in which claims are reported and settled relatively quickly are commonly referred to as short tail lines principally property lines on the other hand casualty claims tend to take longer to be reported and settled and casualty lines are generally referred to as long tail lines estimates of ultimate losses for shorter tail lines with the exception of loss estimates for large catastrophic events generally exhibit less volatility than those for the longer tail lines   the company uses a variety of actuarial methodologies such as the expected loss ratio method chain ladder methods and bornhuetterferguson methods supplemented by judgment where appropriate to estimate ultimate loss and lae for each exposure group   expected loss ratio method the expected loss ratio method uses earned premium times an expected loss ratio to calculate ultimate losses for a given underwriting or accident year this method relies entirely on expectation to project ultimate losses with no consideration given to actual losses as such it may be appropriate for an immature underwriting or accident year where few if any losses have been reported or paid but less appropriate for a more mature year   chain ladder method chain ladder methods use a standard loss development triangle to project ultimate losses agetoage development factors are selected for each development period and combined to calculate agetoultimate development factors which are then applied to paid or reported losses to project ultimate losses this method relies entirely on actual paid or reported losses to project ultimate losses no other factors such as changes in pricing or other expectations are taken into account it is most appropriate for groups with homogeneous stable experience where past development patterns are expected to continue in the future it is least appropriate for groups which have changed significantly over time or which are more volatile   bornhuetterferguson method the bornhuetterferguson method is a combination of the expected loss ratio method and the chain ladder method ultimate losses are projected based partly on actual paid or reported losses and partly on expectation incurred but not reported ibnr reserves are calculated using earned premium an a priori loss ratio and selected agetoage development factors and added to actual reported paid losses to determine ultimate losses it is more responsive to actual reported or paid development than the expected loss ratio method but less responsive than the chain ladder method the reliability of the method depends on the accuracy of the selected a priori loss ratio   although the company uses similar actuarial methods for both short tail and long tail lines the faster reporting of experience for the short tail lines allows the company to have greater confidence in its estimates of ultimate losses for short tail lines at an earlier stage than for long tail lines as a result the company utilizes as well exposurebased methods to estimate its ultimate losses for longer tail lines especially for immature underwriting or accident years for both short and long tail lines the company supplements these general approaches with analytically based judgments  f33     key actuarial assumptions contain no explicit provisions for reserve uncertainty nor does the company supplement the actuarially determined reserves for uncertainty   carried reserves at each reporting date are the companys best estimate of ultimate unpaid losses and lae at that date the company completes detailed reserve studies for each exposure group annually for both reinsurance and insurance operations the completed annual reserve studies are rolledforward for each accounting period until the subsequent reserve study is completed analyzing the rollforward process involves comparing actual reported losses to expected losses based on the most recent reserve study the company analyzes significant variances between actual and expected losses and post adjustments to its reserves as warranted   the company continues to receive claims under expired insurance and reinsurance contracts asserting injuries andor damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances including asbestos environmental claims typically assert liability for a the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or b bodily injury or property damage caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land air or water asbestos claims typically assert liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos   the companys reserves include an estimate of the companys ultimate liability for aampe claims the companys aampe liabilities emanate from mt mckinleys direct insurance business and everest res assumed reinsurance business all of the contracts of insurance and reinsurance under which the company has received claims during the past three years expired more than 20 years ago there are significant uncertainties surrounding the companys reserves for its aampe losses   aampe

required to use fair value measures for recognition or disclosure purposes under gaap and provides a common definition of fair value to be used throughout gaap it defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly fashion between market participants at the measurement date in addition it establishes a threelevel valuation hierarchy for the disclosure of fair value measurements the valuation hierarchy is based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability the level in the hierarchy within which a given fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement with level 1 being the highest priority and level 3 being the lowest priority   the levels in the hierarchy are defined as follows      level 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market          level 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument          level 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement       the companys fixed maturity and equity securities are primarily managed by third party investment asset managers the investment asset managers obtain prices from nationally recognized pricing services these services seek to utilize market data and observations in their evaluation process they use pricing applications that vary by asset class and incorporate available market information and when fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis the services will apply available information through processes such as benchmark curves benchmarking of like securities sector groupings and matrix pricing in addition they use model processes such as the option adjusted spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios for securities that have prepayment features   in limited instances where prices are not provided by pricing services or in rare instances when a manager may not agree with the pricing service price quotes on a nonbinding basis are obtained from investment brokers the investment asset managers do not make any changes to prices received from either the pricing services or the investment brokers in addition the investment asset managers have procedures in place to review the reasonableness of the prices from the service providers and may request verification of the prices in addition the company continually performs analytical reviews of price changes and tests the prices on a random basis to an independent pricing source no material variances were noted during these price validation procedures in limited situations where financial markets are inactive or illiquid the company may use its own assumptions about future cash flows and riskadjusted discount rates to      f35     determine fair value due to the unavailability of prices for fortytwo private placement securities the investment managers valuation committee valued the fortytwo securities at 86536 thousand at december 31 2016 due to the unavailability of prices for two private placement securities the company valued the two securities at 3593 thousand at december 31 2015    the company internally manages a public equity portfolio which had a fair value at december 31 2016 and 2015 of 256041 thousand and 253575 thousand respectively and all prices were obtained from publically published sources   equity securities denominated in us currency with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are categorized as level 1 since the quoted prices are directly observable equity securities traded on foreign exchanges are categorized as level 2 due to the added input of a foreign exchange conversion rate to determine fair or market value the company uses foreign currency exchange rates published by nationally recognized sources   all categories of fixed maturity securities listed in the tables below are generally categorized as level 2 since a particular security may not have traded but the pricing services are able to use valuation models with observable market inputs such as interest rate yield curves and prices for similar fixed maturity securities in terms of issuer maturity and seniority for foreign government securities and foreign corporate securities the fair values provided by the third party pricing services in local currencies and where applicable are converted to us dollars using currency exchange rates from nationally recognized sources   the fixed maturities with fair values categorized as level 3 result when prices are not available from the nationally recognized pricing services the asset managers will then obtain nonbinding price quotes for the securities from brokers the single broker quotes are provided by market makers or brokerdealers who are recognized as market participants in the markets in which they are providing the quotes the prices received from brokers are reviewed for reasonableness by the third party asset managers and the company if the broker quotes are for foreign denominated securities the quotes are converted to us dollars using currency exchange rates from nationally recognized sources in limited circumstances when broker prices are not available for private placements the company will value the securities using comparable market information   the composition and valuation inputs for the presented fixed maturities categories are as follows          us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies and corporations are primarily comprised of us treasury bonds and the fair value is based on observable market inputs such as quoted prices reported trades quoted prices for similar issuances or benchmark yields              obligations of us states and political subdivisions are comprised of state and municipal bond issuances and the fair values are based on observable market inputs such as quoted market prices quoted prices for similar securities benchmark yields and credit spreads              corporate securities are primarily comprised of us corporate and public utility bond issuances and the fair values are based on observable market inputs such as quoted market prices quoted prices for similar securities benchmark yields and credit spreads              assetbacked and mortgagebacked securities fair values are based on observable inputs such as quoted prices reported trades quoted prices for similar issuances or benchmark yields and cash flow models using observable inputs such as prepayment speeds collateral performance and default spreads              foreign government securities are comprised of global nonus sovereign bond issuances and the fair values are based on observable market inputs such as quoted market prices quoted prices for similar securities and models with observable inputs such as benchmark yields and credit spreads and then where applicable converted to us dollars using an exchange rate from a nationally recognized source      f36            foreign corporate securities are comprised of global nonus corporate bond issuances and the fair values are based on observable market inputs such as quoted market prices quoted prices for similar securities and models with observable inputs such as benchmark yields and credit spreads and then where applicable converted to us dollars using an exchange rate from a nationally recognized source       the company sold seven equity index put option contracts based on two indices in 2001 and 2005 which remain outstanding the company sold these equity index put options as insurance products with the intent of achieving a profit these equity index put option contracts meet the definition of a derivative under fasb guidance and the companys position in these equity index put option contracts is unhedged accordingly these equity index put option contracts are carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss   the company sold six equity index put option contracts based on the standard amp poors 500 sampp 500 index for total consideration net of commissions of 22530 thousand based on historical index volatilities and trends and the december 31 2016 sampp 500 index value the company estimates the probability that each equity index put option contract of the sampp 500 index falling below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 7 the theoretical maximum payouts under these six equity index put option contracts would occur if on each of the exercise dates the sampp 500 index value were zero at december 31 2016 the present value of these theoretical maximum payouts using a 3 discount factor was 445627 thousand conversely if the contracts had all expired on december 31 2016 with the sampp index at 223883 there would have been no settlement amount   the company sold one equity index put option contract based on the ftse 100 index for total consideration net of commissions of 6706 thousand based on historical index volatilities and trends and the december 31 2016 ftse 100 index value the company estimates the probability that the equity index put option contract of the ftse 100 index will fall below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 25 the theoretical maximum payout under the equity index put option contract would occur if on the exercise date the ftse 100 index value was zero at december 31 2016 the present value of the theoretical maximum payout using a 3 discount factor and current exchange rate was 36231 thousand conversely if the contract had expired on december 31 2016 with the ftse index at 714283 there would have been no settlement amount   at december 31 2016 and 2015 the fair value for these equity put options was 22059 thousand and 40705 thousand respectively   the companys liability for equity index put options is categorized as level 3 since there is no active market for these seven long dated equity put options the fair values for these options are calculated by the company using an industry accepted pricing model blackscholes the model inputs and assumptions are risk free interest rates equity market indexes values volatilities and dividend yields and duration the model results are then adjusted for the companys credit default swap rate all of these inputs and assumptions are updated quarterly one of the option contacts is in british pound sterling so the fair value for this contract is converted to us dollars using an exchange rate from a nationally recognized source    f37     the following table presents the fair value measurement levels for all assets and liabilities which the company has recorded at fair value fair and market value as of the
