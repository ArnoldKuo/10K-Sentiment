which an insurance company the reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurance or reinsurance company the ceding company against all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more insurance contracts reinsurance can provide a ceding company with several benefits including a reduction in its net liability on individual risks or classes of risks catastrophe protection from large andor multiple losses andor a reduction in operating leverage as measured by the ratio of net premiums and reserves to capital reinsurance also provides a ceding company with additional underwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write more business than would be acceptable relative to the ceding companys financial resources reinsurance does not discharge the ceding company from its liability to policyholders rather it reimburses the ceding company for covered losses  3     there are two basic types of reinsurance arrangements treaty and facultative treaty reinsurance obligates the ceding company to cede and the reinsurer to assume a specified portion of a type or category of risks insured by the ceding company treaty reinsurers do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under their treaties instead the reinsurer relies upon the pricing and underwriting decisions made by the ceding company in facultative reinsurance the ceding company cedes and the reinsurer assumes all or part of the risk under a single insurance contract facultative reinsurance is negotiated separately for each insurance contract that is reinsured facultative reinsurance when purchased by ceding companies usually is intended to cover individual risks not covered by their reinsurance treaties because of the dollar limits involved or because the risk is unusual   both treaty and facultative reinsurance can be written on either a pro rata basis or an excess of loss basis under pro rata reinsurance the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion under excess of loss reinsurance the reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses and expenses in excess of a specified dollar amount known as the ceding companys retention or reinsurers attachment point generally subject to a negotiated reinsurance contract limit   in pro rata reinsurance the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission the ceding commission generally is based on the ceding companys cost of acquiring the business being reinsured commissions premium taxes assessments and miscellaneous administrative expense and may contain profit sharing provisions whereby the ceding commission is adjusted based on loss experience premiums paid by the ceding company to a reinsurer for excess of loss reinsurance are not directly proportional to the premiums that the ceding company receives because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk there is usually no ceding commission on excess of loss reinsurance   reinsurers may purchase reinsurance to cover their own risk exposure reinsurance of a reinsurers business is called a retrocession reinsurance companies cede risks under retrocessional agreements to other reinsurers known as retrocessionaires for reasons similar to those that cause insurers to purchase reinsurance to reduce net liability on individual or classes of risks protect against catastrophic losses stabilize financial ratios and obtain additional underwriting capacity   reinsurance can be written through intermediaries generally professional reinsurance brokers or directly with ceding companies from a ceding companys perspective the broker and the direct distribution channels have advantages and disadvantages a ceding companys decision to select one distribution channel over the other will be influenced by its perception of such advantages and disadvantages relative to the reinsurance coverage being placed   business strategy the companys business strategy is to sustain its leadership position within targeted reinsurance and insurance markets provide effective management throughout the property and casualty underwriting cycle and thereby achieve an attractive return for its shareholders the companys underwriting strategies seek to capitalize on its i financial strength and capacity ii global franchise iii stable and experienced management team iv diversified product and distribution offerings v underwriting expertise and disciplined approach vi

volume key elements of this strategy include careful risk selection appropriate pricing through strict underwriting discipline and adjustment of the companys business mix in response to changing market conditions the company focuses on reinsuring companies that effectively manage the underwriting cycle through proper analysis and pricing of underlying risks and whose underwriting guidelines and performance are compatible with its objectives  4     the companys underwriting strategies emphasize flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions the company believes that its existing strengths including its broad underwriting expertise global presence strong financial ratings and substantial capital facilitate adjustments to its mix of business geographically by line of business and by type of coverage allowing it to participate in those market opportunities that provide the greatest potential for underwriting profitability the companys insurance operations complement these strategies by accessing business that is not available on a reinsurance basis the company carefully monitors its mix of business across all operations to avoid unacceptable geographic or other risk concentrations   commencing in 2015 the company initiated a strategic build out of its insurance platform through the investment in key leadership hires which in turn has brought significant underwriting talent and stronger direction in achieving its insurance program strategic goals of increased premium volume and improved underwriting results recent growth is coming from highly diversified areas including newly launched lines of business as well as product and geographic expansion in existing lines of business the company is building a worldclass insurance platform capable of offering products across lines and geographies complementing its leading global reinsurance franchise as part of this initiative the company received approval from lloyds of london to launch a new syndicate which provides access to additional international business and new product opportunities to further diversify and broaden its insurance portfolio in 2016 and going forward   marketing the company writes business on a worldwide basis for many different customers and lines of business thereby obtaining a broad spread of risk the company is not substantially dependent on any

30 and 10 of the companys 2016 gross written premiums were written in the broker reinsurance insurance and direct reinsurance markets respectively   the broker reinsurance market consists of several substantial national and international brokers and a number of smaller specialized brokers brokers do not have the authority to bind the company with respect to reinsurance agreements nor does the company commit in advance to accept any portion of a brokers submitted business reinsurance business from any ceding company whether new or renewal is subject to acceptance by the company brokerage fees are generally paid by reinsurers the companys ten largest brokers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 53 of gross written premiums in 2016 the largest broker marsh and mclennan accounted for approximately 19 of gross written premiums the second largest broker aon benfield re accounted for approximately 18 of gross written premiums the company believes that a reduction of business assumed from any one broker would not have a material adverse effect on the company   the direct reinsurance market remains an important distribution channel for reinsurance business written by the company direct placement of reinsurance enables the company to access clients who prefer to place their reinsurance directly with reinsurers based upon the reinsurers indepth understanding of the ceding companys needs   the companys insurance business writes direct business targeting commercial property and casualty it also writes business through brokers surplus lines brokers and general agents in 2016 arrowhead general insurance agency accounted for approximately 6 of the companys gross written premium no other single general agent generated more than 3 of the companys gross written

of the companys strategies is to lead as many of the reinsurance treaties it underwrites as possible the company leads on approximately twothirds of its treaty reinsurance business as measured by premium the lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in the strongest position to negotiate price terms and conditions management believes this strategy enables it to obtain more favorable terms and conditions on the treaties on which it participates when the company does not lead the treaty it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty the company may decline to participate on a treaty based upon its assessment of all relevant factors   the companys treaty underwriting process involves a team approach among the companys underwriters actuaries and claim staff treaties are reviewed for compliance with the companys general underwriting standards and most larger treaties are subjected to detailed actuarial analysis the actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the subject exposures and loss experience the company does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties the company does however evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty the company may also conduct underwriting operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding companies to monitor adherence to underwriting guidelines underwriting audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff pricing and risk selection and rate monitoring over time claim audits may be performed in order to evaluate the clients claims handling abilities and practices   the companys facultative underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks limits and maximum risk exposures specified classes of large premium us risks are referred to everest res new york facultative headquarters for specific review before premium quotations are given to clients in addition the companys guidelines require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate limits complexity or volatility regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract nonus risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within the involved operations   in addition to its own underwriting staff the companys insurance operations write casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through select program managers these programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and the program managers capabilities the companys rates forms and underwriting guidelines are tailored to specific risk types the companys underwriting actuarial claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate performance monitoring mechanisms   risk management of underwriting and reinsurance arrangements   underwriting risk and accumulation controls each segment and business unit manages its underwriting risk in accordance with established guidelines these guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors including reinsured company profile line of business geographic location and risk hazards in each case the guidelines permit limited exceptions which must be authorized by the companys senior management management regularly reviews and revises these guidelines in response to changes in business unit product offerings market conditions risk versus reward analyses and the companys enterprise and underwriting risk management processes    10     the operating results and financial condition of the company can be adversely affected by catastrophe and other large losses the company manages its exposure to catastrophes and other large losses by           selective underwriting practices              diversifying its risk portfolio by geographic area and by types and classes of business              limiting its aggregate catastrophe loss exposure in any particular geographic zone and contiguous zones              purchasing reinsurance andor retrocessional protection to the extent that such coverage can be secured costeffectively see reinsurance and retrocession arrangements       like other insurance and reinsurance companies the company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence whether a natural event such as a hurricane or an earthquake or other catastrophe such as an explosion at a major factory a large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties facultative certificates and direct insurance policies across various lines of business   the company focuses on potential losses that could result from any single event or series of events as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events accordingly the company employs various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain from any single catastrophic event or series of events in various geographic areas these techniques range from deterministic approaches such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastropheprone zones and applying reasonable damage factors to modeled approaches that attempt to scientifically measure catastrophe loss exposure using sophisticated monte carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of potential losses on a probabilistic basis   no single computer model or group of models is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which the company conducts business in addition the form quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by reinsureds is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for the companys licensed models which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections further the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined to estimate potential losses by and across business units also while most models have been updated to incorporate claims information from recent catastrophic events catastrophe model projections are still inherently imprecise in addition uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles could add further uncertainty to loss projections from models based on historical data   nevertheless when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events   projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss pml the company defines pml as its anticipated loss taking into account contract terms and limits caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake the pml will vary depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the makeup of the in force book of business the projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods such as 100year events and 250year events for example a 100year pml is the estimated loss to the current inforce portfolio from a single event which has a 1 probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period in other words it corresponds to a 99 probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated pml it is important to note that pmls are estimates modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model as a result there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event pml    11     from an enterprise risk management perspective management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure the company may underwrite the limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors including but not limited to the companys financial resources and expected earnings and riskreward analyses of the business being underwritten   the company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of its operations reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing terms conditions availability and collectability of coverage with the aim of securing cost effective protection from financially secure counterparties the amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time reflecting the companys view of its exposures and the cost of reinsurance   management estimates that the projected net economic loss from its largest 100year event in a given zone represents approximately 11 of its december 31 2016 shareholders equity economic loss is the pml exposure net of third party reinsurance reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and estimated income taxes the impact of income taxes on the pml depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity which is also affected by interaffiliate reinsurance management also monitors and controls its largest pmls at multiple points along the loss distribution curve such as loss amounts at the 20 50 100 250 500 and 1000 year return periods this process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk underwriting and capital management decisions   the companys catastrophe loss projections segmented by risk zones are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process the table below reflects the companys pml exposure net of third party reinsurance at various return periods for its top three

with its enterprise risk management underwriting and capital management plans however there is much uncertainty and imprecision inherent in the catastrophe models and the catastrophe loss estimation process generally as a result there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses from individual events that exceed the pml or other return period projections perhaps by a material amount nor can there be assurance that the company will not experience events impacting multiple zones or multiple severe events that could in the aggregate exceed the companys pml expectations by a significant amount    12     terrorism risk  while the company writes some reinsurance contracts covering terrorism the companys risk management philosophy is to limit the amount of exposure by geographic region and to strictly manage coverage for properties in areas that may be considered a target for terrorists providing terrorism coverage on reinsurance contracts is negotiable and many but not all treaties contain exclusions which limit much of this risk while many property insurance policies are required to offer coverage for terrorism this coverage is often not purchased however terrorism is typically covered by worker compensation policies as a result the company is exposed to losses from terrorism on both its reinsurance and its insurance book of business particularly its workers compensation and property policies however the insurance book generally does not insure large corporations or corporate locations that represent large concentrations of risk   the us terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 provides some protection to the insurance book of business it also provides indirect protection to exposed reinsurance treaties however the company is still exposed to risk of loss from terrorism due to deductibles copays and uncovered lines of business   reinsurance and retrocession arrangements  the company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of its operations reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing terms conditions and availability of coverage with the aim of securing cost effective protection the amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time reflecting the companys view of its exposures and the cost of reinsurance in recent years the company has increased its use of reinsurance offered through capital market facilities   the company participates in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties whereby a ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its reinsurers under one or more of its reinsurance treaties common account retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies including the ceding company with respect to the involved treaties   all of the companys reinsurance and retrocessional agreements transfer significant reinsurance risk and therefore are accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance   at december 31 2016 the company had 10183 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to both paid and unpaid losses ceded of this amount 1750 million or 172 was receivable from resolution group reinsurance barbados limited resolution group 1290 million or 127 was receivable from cv starr bermuda cv starr 1094 million or 107 was receivable from zurich vericherungs gesellschaft zurich 782 million or 77 was receivable from mt logan re segregated accounts and 511 million or 50 was receivable from federal crop insurance corporation fcic the receivables from resolution group and cv starr are fully collateralized by individual trust agreements no other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5 of our receivables although management carefully selects its reinsurers the company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve the company of its liability to insureds or ceding companies see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition   claims reinsurance claims are managed by the companys professional claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial loss reports and coverage issues monitoring claims handling activities of ceding companies establishing and adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of claims in addition to claims assessment processing and payment the claims staff selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies insurance claims are generally handled by third party claims service providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the companys professional claims staff    13     the company intensively manages its asbestos and environmental aampe exposures through a dedicated centrally managed claim staff with experienced claim and legal professionals who specialize in the handling of such exposures they actively manage each individual insured and reinsured account responding to claim developments with evaluations of the involved exposures and adjustment of reserves as appropriate specific or general claim developments that may have material implications for the company are regularly communicated to senior management actuarial legal and financial areas senior management and claim management personnel meet at least quarterly to review the companys overall reserve positions and make changes if appropriate the company continually reviews its internal processing communications and analytics seeking to enhance the management of its aampe exposures in particular in regard to changes in asbestos claims and litigation   reserves for unpaid property and casualty losses and lae significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the insurer by the reinsurer to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and lae insurers and reinsurers establish reserves which are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses for losses that have already occurred actual losses and lae paid may deviate perhaps substantially from such reserves to the extent reserves prove to be insufficient to cover actual losses and lae after taking into account available reinsurance coverage the company would have to recognize such reserve shortfalls and incur a charge to earnings which could be material in the period such recognition takes place see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  loss and lae reserves   as part of the reserving process insurers and reinsurers evaluate historical data and trends and make judgments as to the impact of various factors such as legislative and judicial developments that may affect future claim amounts changes in social and political attitudes that may increase loss exposures and inflationary and general economic trends while the reserving process is difficult and subjective for insurance companies the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer due primarily to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies in addition trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development in the same manner or to the same degree in the future as a result actual losses and lae may deviate perhaps substantially from estimates of reserves reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements   the companys loss and lae reserves represent managements best estimate of the ultimate liability while there can be no assurance that these reserves will not need to be increased in the future management believes that the companys existing reserves and reserving methodologies reduce the likelihood that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results

the safe harbor provisions contained therein see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  safe harbor disclosure   like many other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies the company has experienced loss development for prior accident years which has impacted losses and lae reserves and caused corresponding effects to income

policy and guidelines and together with senior management for overseeing their execution   the companys principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet its insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize aftertax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio considering these objectives the company views its investment portfolio as having two components 1 the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities its core fixed maturities portfolio and 2 investments funded by the companys shareholders equity   for the portion needed to satisfy global outstanding liabilities the company generally invests in taxable and taxpreferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of aa3 for the us portion of this portfolio the companys mix of taxable and taxpreferenced investments is adjusted periodically consistent with the companys current and projected us operating results market conditions and our tax position this global fixed maturity securities portfolio is externally managed by an independent professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by the company   over the past several years the company has expanded the allocation of its investments funded by shareholders equity to include 1 a greater percentage of publicly traded equity securities 2 emerging market fixed maturities through mutual fund structures as well as individual holdings 3 high yield fixed maturities 4 bank loan securities and 5 private equity limited partnership investments the objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the riskadjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes which are also less subject to changes in value with movements in interest rates the company limits its allocation to these asset classes because of 1 the potential for volatility in their values and 2 the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models the company uses investment managers experienced in these markets and adjusts its allocation to these investments based upon market conditions at december 31 2016 the market value of investments in these investment market sectors carried at both market and fair value approximated 50 of shareholders equity   the duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early prepayments the companys fixed income investment guidelines include a general duration guideline this investment duration guideline is established and periodically revised by management which considers economic and business factors as well as the companys average duration of potential liabilities which at december 31 2016 is estimated at approximately 42 years based on the estimated payouts of underwriting liabilities using standard duration calculations   the duration of the fixed income portfolio at december 31 2016 and 2015 was 33 years and 32 years respectively the company has shortened the duration of its portfolio in recent years in response to very low available yields particularly on securities with longer maturities as a result the company has focused on purchasing high quality shorter duration investments and investments with floating rate yields these investments will be less subject to decline in market value if interest rates rise in the future as forecasted by most investment analysts   for each currency in which the company has established substantial loss and lae reserves the company seeks to maintain invested assets denominated in such currency in an amount approximately equal to the estimated liabilities approximately 29 of the companys consolidated reserves for losses and lae and unearned premiums represent amounts payable in foreign currencies   the companys net investment income was 4731 million 4735 million and 5305 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the slight decrease from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to a decline in income from fixed maturities reflective of lower reinvestment rates partially offset by an increase in income from limited partnerships the decline from 2015 to 2014 was mainly due to a decline in income from fixed maturities reflective of lower reinvestment rates and a decline in income from limited partnerships    17     the company had net realized capital losses for 2016 of 72 million in 2016 the company recorded 316 million of otherthantemporary impairments on fixed maturity securities 280 million of realized capital loss from the sale of its heartland subsidiary and 67 million of net realized capital losses from sales of

am best standard amp poors and moodys these ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders and should not be considered an indication of the degree or lack of risk involved in a direct or indirect equity investment in an insurance or reinsurance company   all of the belowmentioned ratings are continually monitored and revised if necessary by each of the rating agencies the ratings presented in the following table were in effect as of february 10 2017   the company believes that its ratings are important as they provide the companys customers and its investors with an independent assessment of the companys financial strength using a rating scale that provides for relative comparisons strong financial ratings are particularly important for reinsurance companies ceding companies must rely on their reinsurers to pay covered losses well into the future as a result a highly rated reinsurer is generally preferred      operating subsidiary       am best

competition the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive as well as cyclical by product and market as such financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of constrained availability higher rates and stronger profits followed by periods of abundant capacity lower rates and constrained profitability competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that we underwrite is based on many factors including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by am best andor standard amp poors underwriting expertise the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized capacity and coverages offered premiums charged other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered services offered speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written furthermore the market impact from these competitive factors related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels   the company competes in the us bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors the companys competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies domestic and international underwriting operations including underwriting syndicates at lloyds of london and certain government sponsored risk transfer vehicles some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company and have established long term and continuing business relationships which can be a significant competitive advantage in addition the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and recently the securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition   worldwide insurance and reinsurance market conditions continued to be very competitive particularly in the property catastrophe and casualty reinsurance lines of business generally there was ample insurance and reinsurance capacity relative to demand as well as additional capital from the capital markets through insurance linked financial instruments these financial instruments such as side cars catastrophe bonds and collateralized reinsurance funds provide capital markets with access to insurance and reinsurance risk exposure the capital markets demand for these products is being primarily driven by the current low interest rate environment and the desire to achieve greater risk diversification and potentially higher returns on their investments this increased competition is generally having a negative impact on rates terms and conditions however the impact varies widely by market and coverage   rates tend to fluctuate by specific region and products particularly areas recently impacted by large catastrophic events although there were flooding and wind storm events and earthquakes in parts of the world the overall 2013 2014 and 2015 catastrophe losses for the industry were considerably lower than average during 2016 there was an increase in catastrophes the fort mcmurray canadian wildfire hurricane matthew which affected a large area of the caribbean and southeastern united states storms and an earthquake in ecuador there are industry predictions that the catastrophe losses for 2016 may exceed the inflationadjusted ten year average catastrophe amounts while the future impact on market conditions from these catastrophes cannot be determined at this time it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall markets but may impact loss affected areas    22     commencing in 2015 the company initiated a strategic build out of its insurance platform through the investment in key leadership hires which in turn has brought significant underwriting talent and stronger direction in achieving our insurance program strategic goals of increased premium volume and improved underwriting results recent growth is coming from highly diversified areas including newly launched lines of business as well as product and geographic expansion in existing lines of business the company is building a worldclass insurance platform capable of offering products across lines and geographies complementing our leading global reinsurance franchise as part of this initiative the company received approval from lloyds of london to launch a new syndicate in 2016 which provided the company access to additional international business and new product opportunities to further diversify and broaden its insurance portfolio   overall the company believes that given its size strong ratings distribution system reputation expertise and capital market vehicle activity the current marketplace conditions provide profit opportunities the company continues to employ its strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit potential while maintaining balance and diversification in its overall portfolio   employees as of february 1 2017 the company employed 1121 persons management believes that employee relations are good none of the companys employees are

the us national association of insurance commissioners naic has developed a formula to measure the amount of capital appropriate for a property and casualty insurance company to support its overall

to prevent insolvencies to ward off other financial difficulties of insurance companies and to establish uniform regulatory standards among state insurance departments   under the approved formula a companys statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital rbc if this ratio is above a minimum threshold no action is necessary below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which an insurers domiciliary state regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over an insurer as the ratio of surplus to rbc decreases the mildest intervention requires an insurer to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions the most severe action requires an insurer to be rehabilitated or liquidated  25     based on their financial positions at december 31 2016 everest re everest
