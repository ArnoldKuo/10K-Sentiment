january 2 2011 heartland specializes in crop insurance which is written mainly through everest national      reinsurance industry overview reinsurance is an arrangement in which an insurance company the reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurance or reinsurance company the ceding company against all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more insurance contracts reinsurance can provide a ceding company with several benefits including a reduction in its net liability on individual risks or classes of risks catastrophe protection from large andor multiple losses andor a reduction in operating leverage as measured by the ratio of net premiums and reserves to capital reinsurance also provides a ceding company with additional underwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write more business than would be acceptable relative to the ceding companys financial resources reinsurance does not discharge the ceding company from its liability to policyholders rather it reimburses the ceding company for covered losses   there are two basic types of reinsurance arrangements treaty and facultative treaty reinsurance obligates the ceding company to cede and the reinsurer to assume a specified portion of a type or category of risks insured by the ceding company treaty reinsurers do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under their treaties instead the reinsurer relies upon the pricing and underwriting decisions made by the ceding company in facultative reinsurance the ceding company cedes and the reinsurer assumes all or part of the risk under a single insurance contract facultative reinsurance is negotiated separately for each insurance contract that is reinsured facultative reinsurance when purchased by ceding companies usually is intended to cover individual risks not covered by their reinsurance treaties because of the dollar limits involved or because the risk is unusual   both treaty and facultative reinsurance can be written on either a pro rata basis or an excess of loss basis under pro rata reinsurance the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion under excess of loss reinsurance the reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses and expenses in excess of a specified dollar amount known as the ceding companys retention or reinsurers attachment point generally subject to a negotiated reinsurance contract limit   in pro rata reinsurance the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission the ceding commission generally is based on the ceding companys cost of acquiring the business being reinsured commissions premium taxes assessments and miscellaneous administrative expense and may contain profit sharing provisions whereby the ceding commission is adjusted based on loss experience premiums paid by the ceding company to a reinsurer for excess of loss reinsurance are not directly proportional to the premiums that the ceding company receives because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk there is usually no ceding commission on excess of loss reinsurance   reinsurers may purchase reinsurance to cover their own risk exposure reinsurance of a reinsurers business is called a retrocession reinsurance companies cede risks under retrocessional agreements to other reinsurers known as retrocessionaires for reasons similar to those that cause insurers to purchase reinsurance to reduce net liability on individual or classes of risks protect against catastrophic losses stabilize financial ratios and obtain additional underwriting capacity   reinsurance can be written through intermediaries generally professional reinsurance brokers or directly with ceding companies from a ceding companys perspective the broker and the direct distribution channels have advantages and disadvantages a ceding companys decision to select one distribution channel over the other will be influenced by its perception of such advantages and disadvantages relative to the reinsurance coverage being placed        3             business strategy the companys business strategy is to sustain its leadership position within targeted reinsurance and insurance markets provide

the company with the primary exception of foreign exchange risks for more information about the risks see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  safe harbor disclosure   underwriting one of the companys strategies is to lead as many of the reinsurance treaties it underwrites as possible the company leads on approximately twothirds of its treaty reinsurance business as measured by premium the lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in the strongest position to negotiate price terms and conditions management believes this strategy enables it to obtain more favorable terms and conditions on the treaties on which it participates when the company does not lead the treaty it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty the company may decline to participate on a treaty based upon its assessment of all relevant factors   the companys treaty underwriting process involves a team approach among the companys underwriters actuaries and claim staff treaties are reviewed for compliance with the companys general underwriting standards and most larger treaties are subjected to detailed actuarial analysis the actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the subject exposures and loss experience the company does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties the company does however evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty the company may also conduct underwriting operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding companies to monitor adherence to underwriting guidelines underwriting audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff pricing and risk selection and rate monitoring over time claim audits may be performed in order to evaluate the clients claims handling abilities and practices   the companys facultative underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks limits and maximum risk exposures specified classes of large premium us risks are referred to everest res new york facultative headquarters for specific review before premium quotations are given to clients in addition the companys guidelines require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate limits complexity or volatility regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract nonus risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within the involved operations   the companys insurance operations principally write casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through select program managers these programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and the program managers capabilities the companys rates forms and underwriting guidelines are tailored to specific risk types the companys underwriting actuarial claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate performance monitoring mechanisms   risk management of underwriting and retrocession arrangements   underwriting risk and accumulation controls each segment and business unit manages its underwriting risk in accordance with established guidelines these guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors including ceding company profile line of business geographic location and risk hazards in each case the guidelines permit limited exceptions which must be authorized by the companys senior management management regularly reviews and revises these guidelines in response to changes in business unit market conditions risk versus reward analyses and the companys enterprise and underwriting risk management processes        9             the operating results and financial condition of the company can be adversely affected by catastrophe and other large losses the company manages its exposure to catastrophes and other large losses by           selective underwriting practices              diversifying its risk portfolio by geographic area and by types and classes of business              limiting its aggregate catastrophe loss exposure in any particular geographic zone and contiguous zones              purchasing reinsurance andor retrocessional protection to the extent that such coverage can be secured costeffectively see reinsurance and retrocession arrangements      like other insurance and reinsurance companies the company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence whether a natural event such as a hurricane or an earthquake or other catastrophe such as an explosion at a major factory a large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties facultative certificates and across lines of business   the company focuses on potential losses that could result from any single event or series of events as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events accordingly the company employs various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain from any single catastrophic event or series of events in various geographic areas these techniques range from deterministic approaches such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastropheprone zones and applying reasonable damage factors to modeled approaches that attempt to scientifically measure catastrophe loss exposure using sophisticated monte carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis   no single computer model or group of models is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which the company conducts business in addition the form quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for the companys licensed models which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections further the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business units also while most models have been updated to incorporate claims information from recent catastrophic events catastrophe model projections are still inherently imprecise in addition uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles add to the already significant uncertainty of loss projections from models using historic long term frequency and severity data   nevertheless when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events   projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss pml the company defines pml as its anticipated loss taking into account contract terms and limits caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake the pml will vary depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the makeup of the in force book of business the projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods such as 100year events and 250year events for example a 100year pml is the estimated loss to the current inforce portfolio from a single event which has a 1 probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period in other words it corresponds to a 99 probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated pml it is important to note that pmls are estimates modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model as a result there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event pml        10             from an enterprise risk management perspective management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure the company may underwrite the limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors including but not limited to the companys financial resources and expected earnings and riskreward analyses of the business being underwritten   the company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of its operations reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing terms conditions and availability of coverage with the aim of securing cost effective protection the amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time reflecting the companys view of its exposures and the cost of reinsurance   management estimates that the projected net economic loss from its largest 100year event in a given zone represents approximately 11 of its projected 2014 shareholders equity economic loss is the pml exposure net of third party reinsurance and the noncontrolling interests of mt logan re reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and estimated income taxes the impact of income taxes on the pml depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity which is also affected by interaffiliate reinsurance management also monitors and controls its largest pmls at multiple points along the loss distribution curve such as loss amounts at the 20 50 100 250 500 and 1000 year return periods this process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk underwriting and capital management decisions   the companys catastrophe loss projections segmented by risk zones are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process the table below reflects the companys pml exposure net of third party reinsurance and the noncontrolling interests of

monitoring analyzing and managing catastrophe exposures provide a credible risk management framework which are integrated with its enterprise risk management underwriting and capital management plans however there is much uncertainty and imprecision inherent in the catastrophe models and the catastrophe loss estimation process generally as a result there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses from individual events that exceed the pml or other return period projections perhaps by a material amount nor can there be assurance that the company will not experience events impacting multiple zones or multiple severe events that could in the aggregate exceed the companys pml expectations by a significant amount        11            terrorism risk  the company has limited exposure to losses from terrorism risk while the company writes some reinsurance contracts covering terrorism the companys risk management philosophy is to limit the amount of exposure by geographic region and to strictly manage coverage for properties in areas that may be considered a target for terrorists although providing terrorism coverage on reinsurance contracts is negotiable most insurance policies mandate inclusion of terrorism coverage as a result the company is exposed to losses from terrorism on its insurance book of business particularly its workers compensation and property policies however the insurance book generally does not insure large corporations or corporate locations that represent large concentrations of risk   because of the limited nature of terrorism exposure the us terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 and its amendments do not have a significant impact on company operations   reinsurance and retrocession arrangements  the company does not typically purchase significant retrocessional coverage for specific reinsurance business written but it will do so when management deems it to be prudent andor costeffective to reinsure a portion of the risks being assumed the company participates in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties whereby a ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its reinsurers under one or more of its reinsurance treaties common account retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies including the ceding company with respect to the involved treaties   the company typically considers the purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance program exposures written by the insurance segment the type of reinsurance coverage considered is dependent upon individual risk exposures individual program exposures aggregate exposures by line of business overall segment and corporate wide exposures and the cost effectiveness of available reinsurance facultative reinsurance will typically be considered for large individual exposures and quota share reinsurance will generally be considered for entire programs of business   the company also considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection covering the potential accumulation of exposures such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the availability of costeffective retrocessional protection   all of the companys reinsurance and retrocessional agreements transfer significant reinsurance risk and therefore are accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance   at december 31 2013 the company had 5409 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to both paid and unpaid losses ceded of this amount 1454 million or 269 was receivable from cv starr bermuda cv starr 953 million or 176 was receivable from federal crop insurance company fcic 439 million or 81 was receivable from transatlantic reinsurance company transatlantic 377 million or 70 was receivable from berkley insurance company berkley and 274 million or 51 was receivable from munich reinsurance america inc munich re the receivable from cv starr is fully collateralized by a trust agreement no other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5 of the companys receivables although management carefully selects its reinsurers the company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve the company of its liability to insureds or ceding companies see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition

manages its asbestos and environmental aampe exposures through dedicated centrally managed claim staffs for mt mckinley and everest re both are staffed with experienced claim and legal professionals who specialize in the handling of such exposures these units actively manage each individual insured and reinsured account responding to claim developments with evaluations of the involved exposures and adjustment of reserves as appropriate specific or general claim developments that may have material implications for the company are regularly communicated to senior management actuarial legal and financial areas senior management and claim management personnel meet at least quarterly to review the companys overall reserve positions and make changes if appropriate the company continually reviews its internal processing communications and analytics seeking to enhance the management of its aampe exposures in particular in regard to changes in asbestos claims and litigation   reserves for unpaid property and casualty losses and lae significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the insurer by the reinsurer to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and lae insurers and reinsurers establish reserves which are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses for losses that have already occurred actual losses and lae paid may deviate perhaps substantially from such reserves to the extent reserves prove to be insufficient to cover actual losses and lae after taking into account available reinsurance coverage the company would have to recognize such reserve shortfalls and incur a charge to earnings which could be material in the period such recognition takes place see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  loss and lae reserves   as part of the reserving process insurers and reinsurers evaluate historical data and trends and make judgments as to the impact of various factors such as legislative and judicial developments that may affect future claim amounts changes in social and political attitudes that may increase loss exposures and inflationary and general economic trends while the reserving process is difficult and subjective for insurance companies the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer due primarily to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies in addition trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development in the same manner or to the same degree in the future as a result actual losses and lae may deviate perhaps substantially from estimates of reserves reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements   like many other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies the company has experienced adverse loss development for prior accident years which has led to increases in losses and lae reserves and corresponding charges to income loss in the periods in which the adjustments were made there can be no assurance that adverse development from prior years will not continue in the future or that such adverse development will not have a material adverse effect on net income loss   changes in historical reserves the following table shows changes in historical loss reserves for the company for 2003 and subsequent years the table is presented on a gaap basis except that the companys loss reserves for its canadian branch operations are presented in canadian dollars the impact of which is not material the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and lae recorded at each year end date the upper paid portion of the table presents the related cumulative amounts paid through each subsequent year end the lower liability reestimated portion shows the reestimated amount of the original reserves as of the end          13            of each succeeding year the reserve estimates have been revised as more information became known about the actual claims for which the reserves were carried the cumulative deficiencyredundancy line represents the cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was established it is equal to the initial reserve less the latest estimate of the ultimate liability   since the company has international operations some of its loss reserves are established in foreign currencies and converted to us dollars for financial reporting changes in conversion rates from period to period impact the us dollar value of carried reserves and correspondingly the cumulative deficiency line of the table however unlike other reserve development that affects net income loss the impact of currency translation is a component of other comprehensive income loss to differentiate these two reserve development components the translation impacts for each calendar year are reflected in the table of effects on pretax income resulting from reserve reestimates   each amount other than the original reserves in the top half of the table below includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods for example if a loss settled in 2006 for 100000 was first reserved in 2003 at 60000 and remained unchanged until settlement the 40000 deficiency actual loss minus original estimate would affect the cumulative deficiency for each of the years in 2003 through 2005 conditions and trends that have affected development of the ultimate liability in the past are not indicative of future developments accordingly it is not appropriate to extrapolate future

minimal development in reserves since 2006 three classes of business were the principal contributors to the deficiencies through 2006 1 the runoff of asbestos claims for both direct and reinsurance business has significantly contributed to the cumulative deficiencies for all years presented through 2006 2 professional liability reinsurance general casualty reinsurance and workers compensation insurance contributed to the deficiencies for year 2003 and 3 property catastrophe adverse development contributed to the deficiency for 2005   in the professional liability reinsurance class the early 2000s saw a proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other corporate financial andor management improprieties this resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of claims under the professional liability policies reinsured by the company in the general casualty area the company has experienced claim frequency and severity greater than expected in the companys pricing and initial reserving assumptions   in the workers compensation insurance class the majority of which was written in california the company has experienced adverse development primarily for accident year 2002 due to higher than expected claim frequency and severity as a result of significant growth in this book of business in a challenging business environment the companys writings in this class were subject to more relative variability than in some of its established andor stable lines of business although cumulative results through 2013 continue to be profitable for this book of business there was some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to older accident years   the adverse development on the 2008 outstanding reserves was primarily attributable to foreign exchange rate movements resulting in an increase in the us dollar reserves in addition the company experienced adverse development on liability exposures for subprime for accident years 20062008 and contractors liability exposures for accident years 20032005 the contractor liability exposures are currently in runoff the company also experienced adverse development on property lines but was offset by favorable development on other casualty lines   the companys loss and lae reserves represent managements best estimate of the ultimate liability while there can be no assurance that these reserves will not need to be increased in the future management believes that the companys existing reserves and reserving methodologies reduce the likelihood that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows these statements regarding the companys loss reserves are forward looking statements within the meaning of the us

 since the company has operations in many countries part of the companys loss and lae reserves are in foreign currencies and translated to us dollars for each reporting period fluctuations in the

result of the same factors described above that caused the deficiencies shown in the ten year gaap loss development table the unfavorable development experienced in the 2003 and prior accident years relate principally to the previously discussed asbestos development other business areas contributing to adverse development were casualty reinsurance including professional liability classes and workers compensation insurance where in retrospect the companys initial estimates of losses were underestimated principally as the result of unanticipated variability in the underlying exposures the favorable development for accident year 2004 relates primarily to favorable experience with respect to property reinsurance business in addition casualty reinsurance has reflected favorable development for accident years 2004 to 2006   the companys loss reserving methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of loss and loss development trends seeking on a timely basis to both adjust reserves for the impact of trend shifts and to factor the impact of such shifts into the companys underwriting and pricing on a prospective basis        16             the following table presents a

guidelines and together with senior management for overseeing their execution   the companys principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet its insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize aftertax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio considering these objectives the company views its investment portfolio as having two components 1 the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities its core fixed maturities portfolio and 2 investments funded by the companys shareholders equity   for the portion needed to satisfy global outstanding liabilities the company generally invests in taxable and taxpreferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of aa3 for the us portion of this portfolio our mix of taxable and taxpreferenced investments is adjusted periodically consistent with the companys current and projected us operating results market conditions and our tax position this global fixed maturity securities portfolio is externally managed by an independent professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by the company   over the past several years the company has expanded the allocation of its investments funded by shareholders equity to include 1 a greater percentage of publicly traded equity securities 2 emerging market fixed maturities through mutual fund structures as well as individual holdings 3 high yield fixed maturities 4 bank loan securities and 5 private equity limited partnership investments the objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the riskadjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes which are also less subject to changes in value with movements in interest rates the company limits its allocation to these asset classes because of 1 the potential for volatility in their values and 2 the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models the company uses investment managers experienced in these markets and adjusts its allocation to these investments based upon market conditions at december 31 2013 the market value of investments in these investment market sectors carried at both market and fair value approximated 62 of shareholders equity        18             the duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early prepayments the companys fixed income investment guidelines include a general duration guideline this investment duration guideline is established and periodically revised by management which considers economic and business factors as well as the companys average duration of potential liabilities which at december 31 2013 is estimated at approximately 37 years based on the estimated payouts of underwriting liabilities using standard duration calculations   the duration of the fixed income portfolio at december 31 2013 and 2012 was 32 years and 30 years respectively the company has shortened the duration of its portfolio in recent years in response to very low available yields particularly on securities with longer maturities as a result the company has focused on purchasing high quality shorter duration investments and investments with floating rate yields these investments will be less subject to decline in market value if interest rates rise in the future as forecasted by most investment analysts   for each currency in which the company has established substantial loss and lae reserves the company seeks to maintain invested assets denominated in such currency in an amount approximately equal to the estimated liabilities approximately 32 of the companys consolidated reserves for losses and lae and unearned premiums represent amounts payable in foreign currencies   the companys net investment income was 5485 million 6002 million and 6200 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to the decline in reported income from fixed maturity securities primarily due to the effects of lower reinvestment rates over the past several years from equity securities due to the liquidation of some mutual funds and from limited partnership investments   the company had net realized capital gains for 2013 of 3002 million in 2013 the company recorded 2589 million of gains due to fair value remeasurements on fixed maturity and equity securities and 424 million of net realized capital gains from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities partially offset by 11 million of otherthantemporary impairments on fixed maturity securities in 2012 net realized capital gains were 1644 million due to 1181 million of gains due to fair value remeasurements on fixed maturity and equity securities and 563 million of net realized capital gains from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities partially offset by 100 million of otherthantemporary impairments on fixed maturity securities in 2011 net realized capital gains were 69 million due to 275 million of net realized capital gains from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities partially offset by 162 million of otherthantemporary impairments on fixed maturity securities and 44 million of losses due to fair value remeasurements on fixed maturity and equity securities   the companys cash and invested assets totaled 166 billion at december 31 2013 which consisted of 873 fixed maturities and cash of which 895 were investment grade 97 equity securities and 30 other invested assets the average maturity of fixed maturity securities was 43 years at

material holdings of derivative investments other than equity index put option contracts as discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements or securities of issuers that are experiencing cash flow difficulty to an extent that the companys management believes could threaten the issuers ability to meet debt service payments

     financial strength ratings the following table shows the current financial strength ratings of the companys operating subsidiaries as reported by am best standard amp poors and moodys these ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders and should not be considered an indication of the degree or lack of risk involved in a direct or indirect equity investment in an insurance or reinsurance company   all of the belowmentioned ratings are continually monitored and revised if necessary by each of the rating agencies the ratings presented in the following table were in effect as of february 28 2014   the company believes that its ratings in general are important to its operations because they provide the companys customers and investors with an independent assessment of the companys underlying financial strength using a scale that provides for relative comparisons strong financial ratings are particularly important for reinsurance companies ceding companies must rely on their reinsurers to pay covered losses well into the future as a result a highly rated reinsurer is generally preferred       operating subsidiary     am best     standard amp poors     moodys

worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive as well as cyclical by product and market as such financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of constrained availability high rates and strong profits followed by periods of abundant capacity low rates and constrained profitability competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that the company underwrites is based on many factors including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by am best andor standard amp poors underwriting expertise the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized capacity and coverages offered premiums charged other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered services offered speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written furthermore the market impact from these competitive factors related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels   the company competes in the us bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors the companys competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations including underwriting syndicates at lloyds some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company and have established long term and continuing business relationships which can be a significant competitive advantage in addition the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition   worldwide insurance and reinsurance market conditions continued to be very competitive particularly in the casualty lines of business generally there was ample insurance and reinsurance capacity relative to demand competition and its effect on rates terms and conditions vary widely by market and coverage yet continued to be most prevalent in the us casualty insurance and reinsurance markets and additional capacity from the capital markets is impacting worldwide catastrophe rates   catastrophe rates tend to fluctuate by global region particularly areas recently impacted by large catastrophic events during the second and third quarters of 2013 canada experienced historic flooding in alberta and toronto which will likely result in higher future catastrophe rates although there were flooding and wind storm events in europe and asia in the latter part of 2013 the overall 2013 catastrophe losses for the industry were lower than average this lower level of losses combined with increased competition is putting downward pressure on rates in certain geographical areas   overall the company believes that current marketplace conditions particularly for catastrophe coverages provide profit opportunities for it given its strong ratings distribution system reputation and expertise the company continues to employ its strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit potential while maintaining balance and diversification in its overall portfolio   employees as of february 1 2014 the company employed 1063 persons

to prevent insolvencies to ward off other financial difficulties of insurance companies and to establish uniform regulatory standards among state insurance departments   under the approved formula a companys statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital rbc if this ratio is above a minimum threshold no action is necessary below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which an insurers domiciliary state regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over an insurer as the ratio of surplus to rbc decreases the mildest intervention requires an insurer to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions the most severe action requires an insurer to be rehabilitated or liquidated   based on their financial positions at december 31 2013 everest re everest
