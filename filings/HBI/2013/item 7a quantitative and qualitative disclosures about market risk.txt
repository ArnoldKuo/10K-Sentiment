  we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices our risk management control system uses analytical techniques including market value sensitivity analysis and value at risk estimations  foreign exchange risk  we sell the majority of our products in transactions denominated in us dollars however we purchase some raw materials pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies our exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with respect to the canadian dollar mexican peso and japanese yen against the us dollar we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates a sensitivity analysis technique has been used to evaluate the effect that changes in the market value of foreign exchange currencies will have on our forward and option contracts at december 29 2012 the potential change in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in the underlying currency price was 7 million  interest rates  our debt under the revolving loan facility and accounts receivable securitization facility bears interest at variable rates as a result we are exposed to changes in market interest rates that could impact the cost of servicing our debt we are required under the senior secured credit facility to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt to reduce interest rate risk caused by floating rate debt issuance we are in compliance with this provision as a result of our 8 senior notes and 6375 senior notes which bear interest at fixed rates approximately 84 of our total debt outstanding at december 29 2012 is at a fixed rate given a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed rates a 25basis point movement in the annual interest rate charged on the outstanding debt balances as of december 29 2012 would only result in a change in annual interest expense of 1 million  commodities  cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products while we have sold our yarn operations we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our largescale yarn suppliers while decreases in cotton prices can result in inventory comprised of products made from highercost yarn and in our purchase of cotton at contractually fixed prices that are above the current market rate our costs for cotton yarn and cottonbased textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton which is affected by among other things weather consumer demand speculation on the commodities market the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control we are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton under our agreements with these suppliers we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases when we elect to fix the cotton cost component under these agreements interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of yarn the yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is their responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton suppliers however our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices although the cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us has historically represented only 6 of our cost of sales it has risen to around 14 primarily as a result of cost inflation costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold for example we estimate that an increase of 001 per pound in cotton prices at current levels of production would affect our annual cost of sales by 3 million related to finished goods manufactured internally in our manufacturing facilities and 1 million related to finished goods sourced by third parties the    56    table of contents  ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified as the effect of movements in cotton prices on industry selling prices are uncertain but any dramatic increase in the price of cotton could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally significant decreases in the price of cotton may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production which could result in lower gross margins particularly if these decreases result in downward price pressure  in addition fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices may influence the prices of other raw materials we use to manufacture our products such as chemicals dyestuffs polyester yarn and foam we generally purchase raw materials at market prices we estimate that a change of 1000 per barrel in the price of oil would affect our freight costs by approximately 5 million at current levels of usage
