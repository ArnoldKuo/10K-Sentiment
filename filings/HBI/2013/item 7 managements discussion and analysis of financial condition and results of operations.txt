authoritative accounting pronouncements that we will be required to adopt in a future period  overview  our company  we are a consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading apparel brands including hanes champion bali playtex just my size leggs barely there wonderbra gear for sports zorba sol y oro and rinbros we design manufacture source and sell a broad range of basic apparel such as tshirts bras panties mens underwear kids underwear casualwear activewear socks and hosiery according to npd our brands held either the number one or number two us market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete for the 12month period ended november 30 2012  discontinued operations  during the second quarter of 2012 we narrowed the focus of our worldwide imagewear business which led us to sell our european imagewear business and discontinue our privatelabel and outer banks domestic imagewear operations that served wholesalers that sell to the screenprint industry  the sale of our european imagewear business to smartwares bv for 15 million approximately 13 million net of fees and other transaction related costs in cash proceeds resulted in a pretax loss of approximately 33 million the sale of our european imagewear business is consistent with our strategic direction to narrow the focus of our worldwide imagewear business by restructuring to exit noncore segments and reduce risk  in connection with the discontinuation of our privatelabel and outer banks domestic imagewear operations we incurred pretax charges of approximately 63 million in 2012 substantially all noncash for the writedown of intangibles inventory markdowns and other related items  the execution of our new worldwide imagewear strategy allows us to focus our imagewear business now known as branded printwear on hanes and champion branded products in the united states with improved operating margins this restructuring is expected to result in a smaller more profitable and less volatile operation in the longer term our branded printwear operations will continue to operate and serve the branded domestic screenprint market with the results of these operations being reported in the outerwear segment    31    table of contents as a result of these actions the current year and prior year disclosures reflect these operations as discontinued operations  our segments  as a result of the reduced size of our sheer hosiery business and changing trends we decided in the first quarter of 2012 to change our external segment reporting to include hosiery operations within the innerwear segment hosiery had previously been reported as a separate segment prior year segment sales and operating profit results including other minor allocation changes have been revised to conform to the current year presentation as a result of these changes our operations are now managed and reported in the following reportable segments            innerwear sells basic branded products that are replenishment in nature under the product categories of intimate apparel mens underwear kids underwear and socks            outerwear sells basic branded products that are primarily seasonal in nature under the product categories of casualwear and activewear to both retailers and wholesalers as well as licensed logo apparel in collegiate bookstores and other channels            direct to consumer includes our valuebased outlet stores and internet operations which sell products from our portfolio of leading brands our internet operations are supported by its catalogs            international primarily relates to the asia latin america canada and australia geographic locations which sell products that span across the innerwear and outerwear reportable segments  outlook for 2013  for 2013 we expect net sales of approximately 460 billion operating profit of 500 million to 550 million and diluted earnings per share of 325 to 340 we expect a decline in branded printwear net sales of 40 million to 50 million with approximately half of that decline occurring in the first quarter reflecting the rationalization that started in mid2012  we intend to increase our overall media investment in 2013 by 30 million to 40 million of which more than twothirds will occur in the second half  through operating results and continued improvements in working capital we expect to generate approximately 400 million to 500 million of operating cash flows in 2013 which includes expected pension contributions of approximately 38 million we ended 2012 with 125 billion in bond debt in 2013 we expect the primary use of cash flows will be for the prepayment of the remaining 250 million of 8 senior notes  business and industry trends  inflation and changing prices  we experienced a sustained increase in various input costs such as cotton and oilrelated materials utilities freight and wages during 2011 and the first half of 2012 and we may experience similar increases in the future our results in 2012 were impacted by this cost inflation by approximately 225 million however with the recent decline in cotton prices the most significant contributor to our cost inflation is now behind us based on current market conditions we expect a reduction in input costs in 2013 primarily as a result of lower cotton costs  cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products while we have sold our yarn operations we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our largescale yarn suppliers and may result in the need to implement future price increases in order to maintain our margins decreases in cotton prices can lead to lower margins for inventory and products produced from cotton we have already purchased particularly if there is    32    table of contents  downward price pressure as a result of consumer demand competition or other factors price increases including those implemented in response to higher prices for cotton and other raw materials contributed favorably to net sales growth and positively affected margins in 2012  our costs for cotton yarn and cottonbased textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton which is affected by among other factors weather consumer demand speculation on the commodities market the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control we are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton under our agreements with these suppliers we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases when we elect to fix the cotton cost component under these agreements interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of yarn the yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is their responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton suppliers however our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices although the cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us has historically represented only approximately 6 of our cost of sales it rose to around 14 in 2012 primarily as a result of cost inflation costs incurred today for materials and labor including cotton typically do not impact our results until the inventory is sold approximately six to nine months later  inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins for example the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process such as oilrelated commodities and other raw materials such as dyes and chemicals and other costs such as fuel energy and utility costs can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold in addition a significant portion of our products are manufactured in countries other than the united states and declines in the value of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs increases in inflation may not be matched by rises in consumer income which also could have a negative impact on spending  other business and industry trends  the basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price product quality selection service and purchasing convenience the majority of our core styles continue from year to year with variations only in color fabric or design details some products however such as intimate apparel activewear and sheer hosiery do have more of an emphasis on style and innovation our businesses face competition from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers as well as smaller companies department stores specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands  our top 10 customers accounted for 63 of our net sales our largest customers in 2012 were walmart target and kohls which accounted for 28 18 and 6 of total sales respectively the increasing bargaining power of retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek greater concessions in their purchase of our products while also demanding exclusivity of some of our products to counteract these effects it has become increasingly important to leverage our national brands through investment in our largest and strongest brands as our customers strive to maximize their performance especially in todays challenging economic environment brands are important in our core categories to drive traffic and project the quality and value our customers demand  our key business strategies  our key business strategies are focused on optimizing our strong brands to drive modest sales growth domestically and internationally using our lowcost global supply chain and implementing cost savings initiatives to expand margins and delivering strong cash flow to create value    33    table of contents we seek to drive modest sales growth by consistently offering consumers brands they trust and products with unsurpassed value our brands have a strong heritage in the basic apparel industry according to npd our brands held either the number one or number two us market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete for the 12month period ended november 30 2012 internationally our commercial markets include mexico canada japan india brazil and china where a substantial amount of gross domestic product growth outside the united states will be concentrated over the next decade our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends is key to our success our design research and product development teams in partnership with our marketing teams drive our efforts to bring innovations to market we seek to leverage our insights into consumer demand in the basic apparel industry to develop new products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing addressing changing customer needs and industry trends we also support our key brands with targeted effective advertising and marketing campaigns  we seek to expand margins through optimizing our lowcost global supply chain and streamlining our operations to reduce costs we believe that we are able to leverage our significant scale of operations to provide us with greater manufacturing efficiencies purchasing power and product design marketing and customer management resources than our smaller competitors our global supply chain spans across both the western and eastern hemispheres and provides us with a balanced approach to product supply which relies on a combination of owned contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions increases the efficiency of our operations reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply our global supply chain enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres thereby diversifying our production risks our textile production plant in nanjing china along with our other textile facilities and arrangements with outside contractors enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres to support our production capacity we have generated significant cost savings margin expansion and contributions to cash flow and will continue to do so as we further optimize our size scale and production capability we generated efficiency savings from our supply chain optimization initiatives of approximately 40 million during 2012  we seek to effectively generate strong cash flow through optimizing our capital structure and managing working capital levels our strong cash flows have resulted in a flexible longterm capital structure that is able to deliver shareholder value in numerous ways including debt reduction and our ability to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions in addition we intend to continue to improve turns for inventory which will also contribute to strong cash flows in 2013  seasonality and other factors  our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors generally our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items we generally have higher sales during the backtoschool and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather which benefits certain product categories such as fleece sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us media advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions  although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers discretionary spending is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit taxation gasoline prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside our control consumers purchases of discretionary items including our products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of    34    table of contents  actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions these consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or to purchase lowerpriced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to time  changes in product sales mix can impact our gross profit as the percentage of our sales attributable to higher margin products such as intimate apparel and mens underwear and lower margin products such as casualwear and activewear fluctuate from time to time in addition sales attributable to higher and lower margin products within the same product category fluctuate from time to time our customers may change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us which makes trends in product sales mix difficult to predict however certain changes in product sales mix are seasonal in nature as sales of socks hosiery and fleece products generally have higher sales during the last two quarters july to december of each fiscal year as a result of cooler weather backtoschool shopping and holidays while other changes in product mix may be attributable to customers preferences and discretionary spending  2012 highlights            net sales in 2012 were 453 billion compared with 443 billion in 2011 representing a 2 increase            operating

expenditures were 41 million in 2012 compared to 90 million in 2011 proceeds from sales of assets were less than 1 million in 2012 and 14 million in 2011            we have substantially completed our debt reduction plan by redeeming all of the floating rate senior notes of 293 million and 250 million of the 8 senior notes in 2012 we expect to redeem the remaining 250 million of 8 senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2013            we narrowed the focus of our worldwide imagewear business during the second quarter of 2012 which led us to sell our european imagewear business and discontinue

consolidated net sales were higher by 91 million or 2 in 2012 compared to 2011 the higher net sales primarily resulted from the following            stronger net sales of our mens underwear and kids underwear product categories primarily resulting from price increases and space gains partially offset by lower unit sales volume            higher net sales in activewear and casualwear product categories as a result of higher unit sales volume and space gains and price increases            lower net sales in our branded printwear category primarily due to lower unit sales volume especially in lightweight commodityoriented products            lower net sales in the international segment primarily due to an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates            slightly lower net sales in our intimate apparel and socks product categories primarily as a result of lower unit sales volume partially offset by price increases and space gains  gross profit  gross profit was 73 million lower in 2012 as compared to 2011 as a percentage of net sales our gross profit was 314 in 2012 compared to 337 in 2011 the lower gross profit was impacted by cost inflation primarily higher cotton costs and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency rates partially offset by price increases efficiency savings from our supply chain and lower excess and obsolete inventory costs  selling general and administrative expenses  our selling general and administrative expenses were 66 million lower in 2012 compared to 2011 the lower selling general and administrative expenses were primarily attributable to lower media advertising and promotion map expenses and lower distribution expenses partially offset by higher noncash pension and stock compensation expenses as a percentage of net sales our selling general and administrative expenses were 217 in 2012 compared to 236 in 2011    36    table of contents other highlights  interest expense  lower by 19 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances mainly resulting from the prepayment of our floating rate notes our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was 581 during 2012 compared to 563 in 2011  other expenses  we incurred charges of approximately 34 million in 2012 related to premiums and an acceleration of unamortized debt issue cost in connection with a 250 million prepayment of our 8 senior notes we also incurred 3 million in 2012 related to an acceleration of unamortized debt issue cost in connection with prepayments totaling 293 million of our floating rate notes  income tax expense  our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 116 in 2012 compared to 148 in 2011 the lower effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to an income tax benefit of approximately 10 million in 2012 related to the realization of unrecognized tax benefits resulting from expiration of statutes of limitations and an income tax benefit of approximately 4 million in 2012 related to an increase in research and development tax credits  in connection with the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 that was signed into law in january 2013 we expect to record a onetime benefit of approximately 6 million related to retroactive tax relief for certain tax provisions that expired in 2012 because the legislation was signed into law after the end of our 2012 fiscal year the retroactive effects of the bill will be reflected in the first quarter of 2013  discontinued operations  discontinued operations include the sale of our european imagewear

determination that certain tax positions had been effectively settled following the finalization of tax reviews and audits for amounts that were less than originally anticipated this nonrecurring income tax benefit was partially offset by a higher proportion of our 2011 earnings attributed to foreign subsidiaries related to our manufacturing operations than in 2010 which are taxed at rates

funded as of december 31 2011 the increase in the funded status is primarily driven by a decrease in longterm pension liabilities as a result of recently passed pension funding relief in addition to an increase in the fair value of plan assets as a result of the markets performance during 2012 in july 2012 the us congress signed the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act map21 bill

working capital resulting from a reduction in inventory levels caused by declining cotton costs and unit levels    46    table of contents investing activities  the lower net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of lower net capital expenditures of 36 million and net cash proceeds of 13 million from the sale of the european imagewear business in 2012 in addition we used cash of 9 million in 2011 related to the acquisition of tnf in april 2011  financing activities  the higher net cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of redeeming 293 million of our floating rate senior notes and 250 million of our 8 senior notes in 2012 and lower net borrowings on our accounts receivable securitization facility and international loan facilities  financing

million aggregate principal amount of the floating rate senior notes the net proceeds from the sale of the floating rate senior notes were approximately 492 million these proceeds together with

we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in each of the international loan facilities at december 29 2012    50    table of contents undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries  as of december 29 2012 the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries was approximately 16 billion of which 6 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested and less than 1 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are not considered permanently reinvested our intention is to reinvest the cash and cash equivalents of those entities whose undistributed earnings we have previously asserted as being permanently reinvested in our international operations we reassess our reinvestment assertions each reporting period and currently believe that we have sufficient other sources of liquidity to support our assertion that such undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be considered to be reinvested permanently  we repatriated 20 million 28 million and 21 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively from earnings generated in such years the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated in the past has been determined and the amount that we expect to repatriate during 2013 will be determined based upon a variety of factors including current year earnings of the foreign subsidiaries foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the us such as for the repayment of debt and other domestic obligations the majority of our repatriation of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries has historically occurred at yearend although we may always repatriate funds earlier in the year based on the needs of our business when we repatriate funds to the us we are required to pay taxes on these amounts based on applicable us tax rates net of any foreign tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against us income tax we paid 0 2 million and 2 million in additional us federal income taxes in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in such years we do not currently expect the amount of repatriated foreign earnings or the resulting additional tax expense in 2013 to differ materially from prior fiscal years  critical accounting policies and estimates  we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our financial statements  the application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures these estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors are described below  sales recognition and incentives  we recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement ii the sales price is fixed or determinable iii title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured which occurs primarily upon shipment we record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and current customer information our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience  note 2d summary of significant accounting policies  sales recognition and incentives to our financial statements describes a variety of sales incentives that we offer to resellers and consumers of our products measuring the cost of these incentives requires in many cases estimating future customer utilization    51    table of contents  and redemption rates we use historical data for similar transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive programs our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience and other available information we classify the costs associated with cooperative advertising as a reduction of net sales in our consolidated statements of income  accounts receivable valuation  accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers we carry our accounts receivable at their net realizable value in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the selling general and administrative expenses line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are primarily reflected as a reduction in the net sales line of our consolidated statements of income our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a large reserve might be required the amount of actual historical losses has not varied materially from our estimates for bad debts  inventory valuation  we carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout or fifo method for our inventories we carry obsolete damaged and excess inventory at the net realizable value which we determine by assessing historical recovery rates current market conditions and our future marketing and sales plans because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time there are inherent uncertainties related to our value determination market factors and other conditions underlying the net realizable value may change resulting in further reserve requirements a reduction in the carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be reversed at a later period while we believe that adequate writedowns for inventory obsolescence have been provided in the financial statements consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory writedowns in the future  rebates discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold  income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of our assets and liabilities as well as for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies if in our judgment it appears that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets which increase income tax expense in the period when such determination is made  we have not provided federal income taxes on that portion of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings that is permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions if we decided to remit those earnings to the united states in a future period due to anticipated cash flow or other business requirements our federal income tax provision and effective tax rate could be impacted    52    table of contents we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution these assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits expiration of statutes of limitations as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations income tax expense is adjusted in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which these events occur  stock compensation  we established the hanesbrands inc omnibus incentive plan of 2006 the omnibus incentive plan to award stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units deferred stock units performance shares and cash to our employees nonemployee directors and employees of our subsidiaries to promote the interest of our company and incent performance and retention of employees stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period estimation of stockbased compensation for stock options granted utilizing the blackscholes optionpricing model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility and expected option life we use a combination of the volatility of our company and the volatility of peer companies for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volatility assumptions we utilize the simplified method outlined in sec accounting rules to estimate expected lives for options granted the simplified method is used for valuing stock option grants by eligible public companies that do not have sufficient historical exercise patterns on options granted to employees we estimate forfeitures for stockbased awards granted that are not expected to vest if any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future  defined benefit pension plans  for a discussion of our net periodic benefit cost plan obligations plan assets and how we measure the amount of these costs see note 15 defined benefit pension plans to our consolidated financial statements  under the pension protection act funding rules our us qualified pension plan is approximately 84 funded as of december 29 2012 compared to 73 funded as of december 31 2011 the increase in the funded status is primarily driven by a decrease in longterm pension liabilities as a result of recently passed pension funding relief in addition to an increase in the fair value of plan assets as a result of the markets performance during 2012 in july 2012 the us congress signed the map21 bill into law included in this legislation was pension funding relief stabilization which allows us corporate defined benefit plans to temporarily use longerterm average discount rates to value its longterm pension liabilities on an actuarial basis by utilizing higher discount rates in the calculation of the plans benefit obligation our minimum required contributions are reduced during the relief period map21 funding benefits will phase out by 2016 we expect to make required cash contributions of approximately 32 million to our pension plans in 2013 based on a preliminary calculation by our actuary in addition to the required cash contributions we may elect to make voluntary contributions to maintain an 80 funded level which will avoid certain benefit payment restrictions under the pension protection act we expect pension expense in 2013 of approximately 15 million compared to 17 million in 2012 see note 15 defined benefit pension plans to our financial statements for more information on the plan asset components the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans are recognized on our balance sheet and changes in the funded status are reflected in comprehensive income we measure the funded status of our plans as of the date of our fiscal year end  the net periodic cost of the pension plans is determined using projections and actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the longterm rate of asset return the net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in the year incurred gains and losses which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions are amortized over the average future expected life of participants    53    table of contents our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as follows            in determining the discount rate we utilized the aon hewitt aa above median curve rounded to the nearest 10 basis points in order to determine a unique interest rate for each plan and match the expected cash flows for each plan this methodology represents a change from using the citigroup pension discount curve in prior years we consider the aon hewitt aa above median curve a more appropriate model to determine the discount rates for our plans            salary increase assumptions were based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions the salary increase assumption only applies to the canadian plans and portions of the hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans as benefits under these plans are not frozen the benefits under the hanesbrands inc pension plan were frozen as of december 31 2005            in determining the longterm rate of return on plan assets we applied a proportionally weighted blend between assuming the historical longterm compound growth rate of the plan portfolio would predict the future returns of similar investments and the utilization of forward looking assumptions            retirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while standard actuarial tables were used to estimate mortality  the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans benefit obligations all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following                    increase decrease in     in millions   pensionexpense     benefitobligation     1 decrease in discount rate           152     1 increase in discount rate            123     1 decrease in expected investment return     6       na     1 increase in expected investment return     6       na    trademarks and other identifiable intangibles  trademarks license agreements customer and distributor relationships and computer software are our primary identifiable intangible assets all of our identifiable intangibles have finite lives therefore we amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives we base the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors including the effects of demand competition expected changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows as of december 29 2012 the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was 120 million of which we are amortizing the entire balance we anticipate that our amortization expense for 2013 will be 13 million  we evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate asset amortization described below under  depreciation and impairment of property plant and equipment we assess identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur in order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization we compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which an identifiable intangible assets carrying value exceeds its fair value during 2012 we recognized a noncash impairment charge of 37 million related to our outer banks trademark and writeoff of goodwill in connection with the discontinuation of our outer banks domestic imagewear operations please see discontinued operations in this annual report on form 10k for more information  goodwill  as of december 29 2012 we had 433 million of goodwill we do not amortize goodwill but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur the timing of our annual goodwill    54    table of contents  impairment testing is the first day of the third fiscal quarter the estimated fair values significantly exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter and no impairment of goodwill was identified as a result of the testing conducted in 2012  in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill in 2012 we estimated the fair value of our reporting units we relied on a number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results business plans and present value techniques as discussed above under trademarks and other identifiable intangibles there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them and the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known  depreciation and impairment of property plant and equipment  we state property plant and equipment at its historical cost and we compute depreciation using the straightline method over the assets life we estimate an assets life based on historical experience manufacturers estimates engineering or appraisal evaluations our future business plans and the period over which the asset will economically benefit us which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life our policies require that we periodically review our assets remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization a change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periods  we test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable such events include significant adverse changes in business climate several periods of operating or cash flow losses forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life we evaluate an assets recoverability by comparing the asset or asset groups net carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset or asset group will generate if we determine that an asset is not recoverable we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  when we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use we depreciate the assets adjusted carrying amount over its remaining useful life we do not restore previously recognized impairment losses if circumstances change  recently issued accounting pronouncements  disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  in december 2011 the fasb issued new accounting rules related to new disclosure requirements
