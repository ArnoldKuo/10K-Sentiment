  this section describes circumstances or events that could have a negative effect on our financial results or operations or that could change for the worse existing trends in our businesses the occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or on the trading prices of our common stock the risks and uncertainties described in this annual report on form 10k are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties that currently are not known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may adversely affect our businesses and operations  economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers suppliers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers discretionary spending is affected by many factors that are outside of our control including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation energy prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending reduced sales at our wholesale customers may lead to lower retail inventory levels reduced orders to hanesbrands or order cancellations these lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets may result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this may result in higher credit risk relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our suppliers of raw materials and finished goods logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and derivatives transactions in addition the inability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on which we rely for raw materials finished goods or services are unable to overcome financial difficulties and provide us with the materials and services we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities or derivatives transactions do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected    13    table of contents significant fluctuations and volatility in the price of various input costs such as cotton and oilrelated materials utilities freight and wages may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  the economic environment in which we are operating continues to be uncertain and volatile which could have unanticipated adverse effects on our business during 2013 and beyond we experienced a sustained increase in various input costs such as cotton and oilrelated materials utilities freight and wages during 2011 and the first half of 2012 and we may experience similar increases in the future inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins for example the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process such as oilrelated commodity prices and other raw materials such as dyes and chemicals and other costs such as fuel energy and utility costs can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors similarly a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the value of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs increases in inflation may not be matched by rises in income which also could have a negative impact on spending in addition sudden decreases in the costs for materials including cotton may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production which could result in lower profitability particularly if these decreases result in downward price pressure if in the future we incur volatility in the costs for materials including cotton and labor that we are unable to offset through price adjustments or improved efficiencies or if consumer spending declines or if our competitors unwillingness to follow our price changes results in downward price pressure our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected  we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market and our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively in the future  the basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price product quality selection service and purchasing convenience our businesses face competition today from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers as well as department stores and other retailers including many of our customers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands in our outerwear segment we also face competition in the branded printwear category from other manufacturers with respect to the sale of lowermargin products to wholesalers and third party embellishers whose purchasing decisions are primarily driven by price rather than brand name recognition increased competition may result in a loss of or a reduction in shelf space and promotional support and reduced prices in each case decreasing our cash flows operating margins and profitability our ability to remain competitive in the areas of price quality brand recognition research and product development manufacturing and distribution will in large part determine our future success if we fail to compete successfully our market share results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected  we rely on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales and the loss of or material reduction in sales to any of our top customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  in 2012 our top 10 customers accounted for 63 of our net sales and our top two customers walmart and target accounted for 28 and 18 of our net sales respectively we expect that these customers will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales in the future moreover our top customers are the largest market participants in our primary distribution channels across all of our product lines we generally do not enter into purchase agreements that obligate our customers to purchase our products and as a result most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis a decision by any of hanesbrands top customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from hanesbrands could substantially reduce revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition if any of our customers devote less selling space to apparel products our sales to those customers could be reduced even if we maintain our share of their apparel business any such reduction in apparel selling space could result in lower sales and our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected    14    table of contents any disruption to our supply chain or adverse impact on its extensive network of operations may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  we have an extensive global supply chain a significant portion of our products are manufactured in or sourced from locations in asia central america and the caribbean basin potential events that may disrupt our supply chain operations include            political instability and acts of war or terrorism or other international events resulting in the disruption of trade            other security risks            operational disruptions            disruptions in shipping and freight forwarding services            increases in oil prices which would increase the cost of shipping            interruptions in the availability of basic services and infrastructure including power shortages            fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulting in uncertainty as to future asset and liability values cost of goods and results of operations that are denominated in foreign currencies            extraordinary weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis floods or fires and            the occurrence of an epidemic the spread of which may impact our ability to obtain products on a timely basis  disruptions in our supply chain could negatively impact our business by interrupting production increasing our cost of sales disrupting merchandise deliveries delaying receipt of products into the united states or preventing us from sourcing our products at all depending on timing these events could also result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns all of the foregoing can have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  the loss of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw materials may interrupt our supplies and materially harm our business  we purchase all of the raw materials used in our products and approximately 25 of the cost of sales derived from apparel designed by us from a limited number of third party suppliers and manufacturers our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of raw materials and finished products from our third party suppliers and manufacturers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of our principal third party suppliers or manufacturers experience financial difficulties that they are not able to overcome resulting from worldwide economic conditions production problems difficulties in sourcing raw materials lack of capacity or transportation disruptions or if for these or other reasons they raise the prices of the raw materials or finished products we purchase from them the magnitude of this risk depends upon the timing of any interruptions the materials or products that the third party manufacturers provide and the volume of production  our dependence on third parties for raw materials and finished products subjects us to the risk of supplier failure and customer dissatisfaction with the quality of our products quality failures by our third party manufacturers or changes in their financial or business condition that affect their production could disrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers and thereby materially harm our business    15    table of contents if we fail to manage our inventory effectively we may be required to establish additional inventory reserves or we may not carry enough inventory to meet customer demands causing us to suffer lower margins or losses  we are faced with the constant challenge of balancing our inventory with our ability to meet marketplace needs inventory reserves can result from the complexity of our supply chain a long manufacturing process and the seasonal nature of certain products increases in inventory levels may also be needed to service our business as we continue to optimize our supply chain to further enhance efficiency improve working capital and asset turns and reduce costs as a result we could be subject to high levels of obsolescence and excess stock based on discussions with our customers and internally generated projections we produce purchase andor store raw material and finished goods inventory to meet our expected demand for delivery however we sell a large number of our products to a small number of customers and these customers generally are not required by contract to purchase our goods if after producing and storing inventory in anticipation of deliveries demand is lower than expected we may have to hold inventory for extended periods or sell excess inventory at reduced prices in some cases below our cost additionally sudden decreases in the costs for materials including cotton may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production if this occurs it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flow particularly if we hold a large amount of excess inventory excess inventory charges can reduce gross margins or result in operating losses lowered plant and equipment utilization and lowered fixed operating cost absorption all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows  conversely we also are exposed to lost business opportunities if we underestimate market demand and produce too little inventory for any particular period because sales of our products are generally not made under contract if we do not carry enough inventory to satisfy our customers demands for our products within an acceptable time frame they may seek to fulfill their demands from one or several of our competitors and may reduce the amount of business they do with us any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  we may not be able to achieve the benefits we are seeking through optimizing our supply chain which could impair our ability to further enhance efficiency improve working capital and asset turns and reduce costs  we have restructured our supply chain to create more efficient production clusters that utilize fewer larger facilities and to balance our production capability between the western hemisphere and asia we consolidated our distribution network by implementing new warehouse management systems and technology and adding new distribution centers and new third party logistics providers to replace parts of our legacy distribution network with our global supply chain infrastructure in place we continue to be focused longterm on optimizing our supply chain to further enhance efficiency improve working capital and asset turns and reduce costs through several initiatives such as suppliermanaged inventory for raw materials and sourced goods ownership arrangements if we are not able to optimize our supply chain we may not be successful at improving working capital and asset turns and reducing costs  our business could be harmed if we are unable to deliver our products to the market due to problems with our distribution network  we distribute our products from facilities that we operate as well as facilities that are operated by third party logistics providers because substantially all of our products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations our operations could be interrupted by extraordinary weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis floods or fires near our distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions to our distribution network in addition our distribution network is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from our distribution facilities if we are unable to successfully operate our distribution network our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected    16    table of contents due to the extensive nature of our foreign operations fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations  we sell a majority of our products in transactions denominated in us dollars however we purchase many of our raw materials pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies as a result when the us dollar weakens against any of these currencies our cost of sales could increase substantially outside the united states we may pay for materials or finished products in us dollars and in some cases a strengthening of the us dollar could effectively increase our costs where we use foreign currency to purchase the us dollars we need to make such payments we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates we are also exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our financial statements due to the translation of operating results and financial position of our foreign subsidiaries  our existing customers may require products on an exclusive basis forms of economic support and other changes that could be harmful to our business  customers increasingly may require us to provide them with some of our products on an exclusive basis which could cause an increase in the number of stock keeping units or skus we must carry and consequently increase our inventory levels and working capital requirements moreover our customers may increasingly seek markdown allowances incentives and other forms of economic support which reduce our gross margins and affect our profitability our financial performance is negatively affected by these pricing pressures when we are forced to reduce our prices without being able to correspondingly reduce our production costs  sales of and demand for our products may decrease if we fail to keep pace with evolving consumer preferences and trends which could have an adverse effect on net sales and profitability  our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to evolving consumer preferences and trends and to translate these preferences and trends into marketable product offerings if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or misjudge the market for our products our sales may be lower than expected and we may be faced with a significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions provide markdown allowances to our customers or liquidate excess merchandise any of which could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability our brand image may also suffer if customers believe that we are no longer able to offer innovative products respond to consumer preferences or maintain the quality of our products  any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure with respect to our information technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business  our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of our business moreover we and our customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in our systems it could also require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure problem or breach  the success of our business is tied to the strength and reputation of our brands including brands that we license to other parties if other parties take actions that weaken harm the reputation of or cause confusion with our brands our business and consequently our sales results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected  we license some of our important trademarks to third parties for example we license champion to third parties for athleticoriented accessories although we make concerted efforts to protect our brands through    17    table of contents  quality control mechanisms and contractual obligations imposed on our licensees there is a risk that some licensees may not be in full compliance with those mechanisms and obligations in that event or if a licensee engages in behavior with respect to the licensed marks that would cause us reputational harm we could experience a significant downturn in that brands business adversely affecting our sales and results of operations similarly any misuse of the wonderbra or playtex brands by sun capital could result in negative publicity and a loss of sales for our products under these brands any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows  we design manufacture source and sell products under trademarks that are licensed from third parties if any licensor takes actions related to their trademarks that would cause their brands or our company reputational harm our business may be adversely affected  we design manufacture source and sell a number of our products under trademarks that are licensed from third parties such as our polo ralph lauren mens underwear because we do not control the brands licensed to us our licensors could make changes to their brands or business models that could result in a significant downturn in a brands business adversely affecting our sales and results of operations if any licensor engages in behavior with respect to the licensed marks that would cause us reputational harm or if any of the brands licensed to us violates the trademark rights of another or are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable we could experience a significant downturn in that brands business adversely affecting our sales and results of operations and we may be required to expend significant amounts on public relations advertising and possibly legal fees  we are prohibited from selling our wonderbra and playtex intimate apparel products in the eu as well as certain other countries in europe and south africa and therefore are unable to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise in such countries  sun capital has an exclusive perpetual royaltyfree license to manufacture sell and distribute apparel products under the wonderbra and playtex trademarks in the member states of the eu as well as russia south africa switzerland and certain other nations in europe due to the exclusive license we are not permitted to sell wonderbra and playtex branded products in these nations and sun capital is not permitted to sell wonderbra and playtex branded products outside of these nations consequently we will not be able to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise relating to the sale of wonderbra and playtex products in these nations for more information on these sales restrictions see business  intellectual property  if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our business may be adversely affected  our trademarks and copyrights are important to our marketing efforts and have substantial value we aggressively protect these trademarks and copyrights from infringement and dilution through appropriate measures including court actions and administrative proceedings we are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing our intellectual property rights infringement or counterfeiting of our products could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect our business actions we have taken to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the united states or other countries such as changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on our ability to enforce those rights  the value of our intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks we are from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some items of our intellectual property    18    table of contents we are subject to certain risks as a result of our indebtedness  our indebtedness includes the 600 million revolving credit facility the revolving loan facility under our senior secured credit facility the senior secured credit facility our 250 million 8000 senior notes due 2016 the 8 senior notes our 1 billion 6375 senior notes due 2020 the 6375 senior notes and the 225 million accounts receivable securitization facility the accounts receivable securitization facility  the senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the 8 senior notes and the 6375 senior notes contain restrictions that affect and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit among other things our ability to borrow funds pay dividends or make other distributions make investments engage in transactions with affiliates or create liens on our assets covenants in the senior secured credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total debt to ebitda earnings before income taxes depreciation expense and amortization or leverage ratio and an additional covenant in the senior secured credit facility requires us to maintain a maximum total senior secured debt to ebitda ratio these restrictions and covenants could limit our ability to obtain additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions meet our debt payment obligations and capital commitments fund any operating losses or future development of our business affiliates obtain lower borrowing costs that are available from secured lenders or engage in advantageous transactions that monetize our assets or conduct other necessary or prudent corporate activities any failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default that accelerates the maturity of our indebtedness under such facilities resulting in an adverse effect on our business  the lenders under the senior secured credit facility have received a pledge of substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries with certain customary or agreedupon exceptions for foreign subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries additionally these lenders generally have a lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries with certain exceptions the financial institutions that are party to the accounts receivable securitization facility have a lien on certain of our domestic accounts receivables as a result of these pledges and liens if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the senior secured credit facility or the accounts receivable securitization facility the lenders under those facilities will be entitled to foreclose on substantially all of our assets and at their option liquidate these assets which would adversely impact the operations of our business  our indebtedness also could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have lower levels of debt these competitors could have greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions secure additional financing for their operations by incurring additional debt expend capital to expand their manufacturing and production operations to lowercost areas and apply pricing pressure on us in addition because many of our customers rely on us to fulfill a substantial portion of their basic apparel demand any concern these customers may have regarding our financial condition may cause them to reduce the amount of products they purchase from us our debt service obligations could also impede our ability to withstand downturns in our industry or the economy  market returns could have a negative impact on the return on plan assets for our pension which may require significant funding  the plan assets of our pension plans which had a return of approximately 11 and negative 1 during 2012 and 2011 respectively are invested mainly in domestic and international equities bonds and real estate we are unable to predict the variations in asset values or the severity or duration of any disruptions in the financial markets or adverse economic conditions in the united states europe and asia the funded status of these plans and the related cost reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty particularly in the current economic environment under the pension protection act of 2006 the pension protection act losses of asset values may necessitate increased funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements under the pension protection act    19    table of contents  funding rules our us qualified pension plan is approximately 84 funded as of december 29 2012 any downward pressure on the asset values of these plans may require us to fund obligations earlier than we had originally planned which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operations  our balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as a noncash expense in our consolidated statement of income  goodwill trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually the fair value of the goodwill assigned to a business unit could decline if projected revenues or cash flows were to be lower in the future due to effects of the global economy or other causes if the carrying value of intangible assets or of goodwill were to exceed its fair value the asset would be written down to its fair value with the impairment loss recognized as a noncash charge in the consolidated statement of income  as of december 29 2012 we had approximately 433 million of goodwill and 120 million of trademarks and other identifiable intangibles on our balance sheet which together represent 15 of our total assets in the second quarter of 2012 in connection with our imagewear restructuring we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 37 million related to our outer banks trademark and goodwill balances no other impairment was identified in 2012 and we have not had any impairment charges in the last two years prior to 2012 changes in the future outlook of a business unit could result in an impairment loss which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could increase our income taxes and decrease our net income  we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the amount of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the united states changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in tax laws adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns and other factors in order to service our debt obligations we may need to increase the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the united states which may significantly increase our income tax expense additionally our strategic initiative to enhance our global supply chain by optimizing lowercost manufacturing capacity and to support our commercial operations outside the united states may result in capital investments outside the united states that impact our income tax expense  our balance sheet includes a significant amount of deferred tax assets we must generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax benefits  as of december 29 2012 we had approximately 563 million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet which represents 16 of our total assets deferred tax assets relate to temporary differences differences between the assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the assets and liabilities in the calculation of taxable income the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax benefits will not be realized if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets which would cause an increase in our effective tax rate a significant increase in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  compliance with environmental and other regulations could require significant expenditures  we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that govern our activities operations and products that may have adverse environmental health and safety effects including laws and    20    table of contents  regulations relating to generating emissions water discharges waste product and packaging content and workplace safety noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in substantial monetary penalties and criminal sanctions future events that could give rise to manufacturing interruptions or environmental remediation include changes in existing laws and regulations the enactment of new laws and regulations a release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or any associated offsite disposal location or the discovery of contamination from current or prior activities at any of our properties while we are not aware of any proposed regulations or remedial obligations that could trigger significant costs or capital expenditures in order to comply any such regulations or obligations could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  our operations in international markets and our earnings in those markets may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks  during 2012 net sales from our international segment were 501 million representing approximately 11 of total net sales in addition a significant amount of our manufacturing and production operations are located or our products are sourced from outside the united states as a result our business is subject to risks associated with international operations these risks include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and the imposition of new tariffs quotas taxes or exchange controls  regulatory changes could limit the countries in which we sell produce or source our products or significantly increase the cost of operating in or obtaining materials originating from certain countries restrictions imposed by such changes can have a particular impact on our business when after we have moved our operations to a particular location new unfavorable regulations are enacted in that area or favorable regulations currently in effect are changed  countries in which our products are manufactured or sold may from time to time impose additional new regulations or modify existing regulations including            additional duties taxes tariffs and other charges on imports including retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which may or may not be based on wto rules and which would increase the cost of products produced in such countries            limitations on the quantity of goods which may be imported into the united states from a particular country including the imposition of further safeguard mechanisms by the us government or governments in other jurisdictions limiting our ability to import goods from particular countries such as china            changes in the classification andor valuation of products that could result in higher duty rates than we have historically paid            modification of the trading status of certain countries            requirements as to where products andor inputs are manufactured or sourced            creation of export licensing requirements imposition of restrictions on export quantities or specification of minimum export pricing andor export prices or duties            creation of other restrictions on imports            limitations on foreign owned businesses or            government actions to cancel contracts redenominate the official currency renounce or default on obligations renegotiate terms unilaterally or expropriate assets  changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors including those listed above could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows    21    table of contents we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act in addition to the anticorruption laws of the foreign countries in which we operate although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business reputation and operating results  we had approximately 51500 employees worldwide as of december 29 2012 and our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our employees or changes to us or foreign employment regulations  we had approximately 51500 employees worldwide as of december 29 2012 this means we have a significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our employees including wage and hour laws and regulations fair labor standards minimum wage requirements overtime pay unemployment tax rates workers compensation rates citizenship requirements and payroll taxes which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs approximately 43900 of those employees were outside of the united states a significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have employees could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases all of which may cause us to incur additional costs expend resources responding to such increases and lower our margins  in addition approximately 30 of our employees in the united states are members of labor organizations or are covered by collective bargaining agreements if there were a significant increase in the number of our employees who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements we would become vulnerable to a strike work stoppage or other labor action by these employees that could have an adverse effect on our business  we may suffer negative publicity if we or our third party manufacturers violate labor laws or engage in practices that are viewed as unethical or illegal which could cause a loss of business  we cannot fully control the business and labor practices of our third party manufacturers the majority of whom are located in asia central america and the caribbean basin if one of our own manufacturing operations or one of our third party manufacturers violates or is accused of violating local or international labor laws or other applicable regulations or engages in labor or other practices that would be viewed in any market in which our products are sold as unethical we could suffer negative publicity which could tarnish our brands image or result in a loss of sales in addition if such negative publicity affected one of our customers it could result in a loss of business for us  our business depends on our senior management team and other key personnel  our success depends upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel some of whom have unique talents and experience and would be difficult to replace the loss or interruption of the services of a member of our senior management team or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business during the transitional period that would be required for a successor to assume the responsibilities of the position our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain key managers sales people and others we may not be able to attract or retain these employees which could adversely affect our business  businesses that we may acquire may fail to perform to expectations and we may be unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses with our existing business  from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisition opportunities to support and strengthen our business we may not be able to realize all or a substantial portion of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions that we may    22    table of contents  consummate newly acquired businesses may not achieve expected results of operations including expected levels of revenues and may require unanticipated costs and expenditures acquired businesses may also subject us to liabilities that we were unable to discover in the course of our due diligence and our rights to indemnification from the sellers of such businesses even if obtained may not be sufficient to offset the relevant liabilities in addition the integration of newly acquired businesses may be expensive and timeconsuming and may not be entirely successful integration of the acquired businesses may also place additional pressures on our systems of internal control over financial reporting if we are unable to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses or if acquired businesses fail to produce targeted results it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition  antitakeover provisions of our charter and bylaws as well as maryland law and our stockholder rights agreement may reduce the likelihood of any potential change of control or unsolicited acquisition proposal that you might consider favorable  our charter permits our board of directors without stockholder approval to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any

various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by our board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder  in addition we have adopted a stockholder rights agreement which provides that in the event of an acquisition of or tender offer for 15 of our outstanding common stock our stockholders other than the acquirer shall be granted rights to purchase our common stock at a certain price the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our common stock without the approval of our board of directors  these and other provisions of maryland law or our charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be considered favorably by our stockholders    23    table of contents
