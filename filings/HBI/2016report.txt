2015 approximately 65 of our cost of sales were from finished goods manufactured through a combination of facilities we own and operate and facilities owned and operated by third party contractors who perform some of the steps in the manufacturing process for us such as cutting andor sewing we sourced the remainder of our finished goods from third party manufacturers who supply us with finished products based on our designs in making decisions about the location of manufacturing operations and third party sources of supply we consider a number of factors including labor local operating costs quality regional infrastructure applicable quotas and duties and freight costs we believe that our balanced approach to product supply which relies on a combination of owned contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions increases the efficiency of our operations reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supplyfinished goods that are manufactured by hanesbrandsthe manufacturing process for the finished goods that we manufacture begins with raw materials we obtain from suppliers the principal raw materials in our product categories are cotton and synthetics cotton and synthetic materials are typically spun into yarn which is then knitted into cotton synthetic and blended fabrics we source all of our yarn requirements from largescale domestic and international suppliers to a lesser extent we purchase fabric from several domestic and international suppliers in conjunction with scheduled production in addition to cotton yarn and cottonbased textiles we use thread narrow elastic and trim for product identification buttons zippers snaps and lace these fabrics are cut and sewn into finished products either by us or by third party contractors we currently operate 47 manufacturing facilities most of our cutting and sewing operations are strategically located in asia central america and the caribbean basin alternate sources of these materials and services are readily availablefinished goods that are manufactured by third partiesin addition to our manufacturing capabilities we also source finished goods we design from thirdparty manufacturers also referred to as turnkey products many of these turnkey products are sourced from international suppliers by our strategic sourcing hubs in asiaall contracted and sourced manufacturing must meet our high quality standards further all contractors and thirdparty manufacturers must be preaudited and adhere to our strict supplier and business practices guidelines these requirements provide strict standards that among other things cover hours of work age of workers health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws and hanesbrands standards each new supplier must be inspected and agree to comprehensive 5table of contentscompliance terms prior to performance of any production on our behalf we audit compliance with these standards and maintain strict compliance performance records in addition to our audit procedures many of our suppliers are certified by the worldwide responsible accredited production or wrap program wrap uses thirdparty independent audit firms and requires factorybyfactory certification we are also a fully accredited participating company in the fair labor associationdistributionas of january 2 2016 we distributed our products from 37 distribution centers these facilities include 16 facilities located in the united states and 21 facilities located outside the united states in regions where we manufacture our products we internally manage and operate 26 of these facilities and we use third party logistics providers who operate the other 11 facilities on our behalf international distribution operations use a combination of third party logistics providers as well as owned and operated distribution operations to distribute goods to our various international marketsinventoryeffective inventory management is a key component of our future success because our customers generally do not purchase our products under longterm supply contracts but rather on a purchase order basis effective inventory management requires close coordination with the customer base we seek to ensure that products are available to meet customer demands while effectively managing inventory levels we employ various types of inventory management techniques that include collaborative forecasting and planning suppliermanaged inventory key event management and various forms of replenishment management processes our suppliermanaged inventory initiative is intended to shift raw material ownership and management to our suppliers until consumption freeing up cash and improving response time we have demand management planners in our customer management group who work closely with customers to develop demand forecasts that are passed to the supply chain we also have professionals within the customer management group who coordinate daily with our larger customers to help ensure that our customers planned inventory levels are in fact available at their individual retail outlets additionally within our supply chain organization we have dedicated professionals who translate the demand forecast into our inventory strategy and specific production plans these individuals work closely with our customer management team to balance inventory investmentexposure with customer service targetsseasonality and other factorsour operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors for instance we generally have higher sales during the backtoschool and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather which benefits certain product categories such as fleece our diverse range of product offerings however provides some mitigation to the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us media advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductionsproduct innovation and marketinga significant component of our marginenhancing innovatetoelevate strategy is our strong product research and development and innovation capabilities from 2013 to 2015 we spent nearly 177 million on design research and product development including the development of new and improved productswe use a disciplined consumerdriven approach to direct our product innovation and marketing efforts we seek to identify relevant consumer insights and longterm megatrends that will impact our product categories over the next five to 10 years we focus our innovation efforts on bigidea platforms that span brands product categories business segments distribution channels and geographies in addition we concentrate on margin accretive product innovations where we can leverage our supply chain in order to drive further economies of scale examples of our product innovation platforms includetagless over a decade ago we launched hanes tagless tees that deliver superior softness without the itch and irritation of a tag in 2012 our consumerdriven innovation process led us to expand this platform to the male underwear bottom category where research indicated that itchy tags were the number two consumer complaint the tagless platform also taps into the power of our supply chain generating significant cost savings and allowing us to expand gross marginscomfortblend comfortblend our fabric innovation that combines cotton and synthetic yarns for products that are softer shrink less and dry faster is an outgrowth of the performance fabric megatrend in developing comfortblend we worked through each step of the big idea process testing the concept the product and the advertising we 6table of contentsintroduced hanes mens comfortblend underwear in 2012 with exceptional results and have now expanded this platform to socks childrens underwear and pantiescomfortflex fit our comfortflex fit platform is another example of our consumerdriven innovation process where research indicated the two most significant consumer complaints in the bra category were that the consumer could not find the right size and that the consumer could not find a comfortable bra comfortflex fit effectively addresses both concerns by combining a simplified shopping system that eliminates the complicated cupandband combinations of traditional bra sizing systems with a more comfortable flexible fit we have successfully leveraged the comfortflex fit platform across our hanes champion playtex bali and jmsjust my size brands where it is driving incremental purchases in a category where consumers typically buy only a little over three bras per yearxtemp xtemp is our newest platform and brings a new level of technology and comfort to basic apparel hanes and champion xtemp garments are designed to keep consumers cooler and drier by increasing the rate of evaporation when body temperature rises and reducing the rate of evaporation as body temperature cools the xtemp platform was successfully introduced in hanes mens underwear and mens socks in 2013 and expanded to womens socks panties bras legwear base layer and childrens underwear and socks in 2014 champion vapor with xtemp technology was introduced in mens and womens activewear in 2013 and expanded to team practicewear and branded printwear in 2014driving innovation platforms across categories is a major element of our innovatetoelevate strategy as it enables us to meet key consumer needs and leverage advertising dollars we believe that the strength of our consumer insights our distinctive brand propositions and our focus on integrated marketing give us a competitive advantage in the fragmented apparel marketplace effectively marketing these innovations also accrues benefits back to our supply chain driving higher volume helps us to leverage scale and drive costs down even further increasing margins while funding additional marketing

existing trends in our businesses the occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or on the trading prices of our common stock the risks and uncertainties described in this annual report on form 10k are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties that currently are not known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may adversely affect our businesses and operationsour ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses could impact our financial resultsas a leading branded apparel company we expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions as part of our longterm business strategy such as our recent acquisition of knights apparel difficulties may arise in the integration of the business and operations of businesses that we acquire and as a result we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and synergies that we expect will result from such transactions achieving cost savings is dependent on consolidating certain operational and functional areas eliminating duplicative positions and terminating certain agreements for outside services additional operational savings are dependent upon the conversion of core operating systems data systems and products and the standardization of business practices complications or difficulties in the conversion of core operating systems data systems and products may result in the loss of customers operational problems onetime costs currently not anticipated or reduced cost savings resulting from such acquisitions annual cost savings in each such transaction may be materially less than anticipated if the closing of the acquisition is delayed unexpectedly the integration of operations is delayed beyond what is anticipated or the conversion to a single set of data systems is not accomplished on a timely basisacquired businesses may not achieve expected results of operations including expected levels of revenues and may require unanticipated costs and expenditures in addition following completion of an acquisition we may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that we and the acquired business have achieved or might achieve separately acquired businesses may also subject us to liabilities that we were unable to discover in the course of our due diligence and our rights to indemnification from the sellers of such other businesses even if obtained may not be sufficient to offset the relevant liabilities in addition the integration of newly acquired businesses may be expensive and timeconsuming and may not be entirely successful integration of the acquired businesses may also place additional pressures on our systems of internal control over financial reporting the process of integrating the operations of acquired businesses could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel if we are unable to successfully integrate any newly acquired business or if the acquired businesses fail to produce targeted results it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition9table of contentsany inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure with respect to our information technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our businessour ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively and support global growth and expansion problems with integrating various data sources challenges in transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of our business hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate largescale and complex automated attacks any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data misappropriation of our consumers or employees personal information or a disruption of our business which could give rise to unwanted media attention materially damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales fines or lawsuitsmoreover we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations proceedings against us by governmental entities or others damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profitssignificant fluctuations and volatility in the price of various input costs such as cotton and oilrelated materials utilities freight and wages may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flowsinflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins for example the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process such as oilrelated commodity prices and other raw materials such as dyes and chemicals and other costs such as fuel energy and utility costs can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors similarly a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the value of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs sudden decreases in the costs for materials including cotton may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production which could result in lower profitability particularly if these decreases result in downward price pressure if in the future we incur volatility in the costs for materials including cotton and labor that we are unable to offset through price adjustments or improved efficiencies or if our competitors unwillingness to follow our price changes results in downward price pressure our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affectedour results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to manage our inventory effectively and accurately forecast demand for our productswe are faced with the constant challenge of balancing our inventory with our ability to meet marketplace needs factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to evolving consumer preferences and trends and to translate these preferences and trends into marketable product offerings as well as unanticipated changes in general economic conditions or other factors which result in cancellations of orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailersinventory reserves can result from the complexity of our supply chain a long manufacturing process and the seasonal nature of certain products we sell a large number of our products to a small number of customers and these customers generally are not required by contract to purchase our goods as a result we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with thirdparty manufacturers before our customers orders are firm if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices which could have an adverse effect on the image and reputation of our brands and negatively impact profitability on the other hand if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or thirdparty manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to our reputation and relationships these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition additionally sudden decreases in the costs for materials including cotton may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production if this occurs it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flow particularly if we hold a large amount of excess inventory excess inventory charges can reduce gross margins or result in operating losses lowered plant and equipment utilization and lowered fixed operating cost absorption all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows10table of contentswe operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market and our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively in the futurethe basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly competition is generally based upon brand comfort fit style and price our businesses face competition today from other large domestic and foreign corporations and manufacturers as well as department stores and other retailers including many of our customers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands also online retail shopping is rapidly evolving and we expect competition in the ecommerce market to intensify in the future as the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping increased competition may result in a loss of or a reduction in shelf space and promotional support and reduced prices in each case decreasing our cash flows operating margins and profitability our ability to identify and capitalize on retail trends including technology ecommerce and other process efficiencies to gain market share and better service our customer base will in large part determine our future success if we fail to compete successfully our market share results of

flows and the market value of our stockwe have a complex multinational tax structure and changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could impact our capital deployment strategy and adversely affect our resultswe have a complex multinational tax structure with multiple types of intercompany transactions and our allocation of profits and losses among us and our subsidiaries through our intercompany transfer pricing agreements is subject to review by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in order to service our debt obligations we may need to increase the portion of the income our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the united states which may significantly increase our income tax expense in addition we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns and related transfer pricing documentation by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition additionally changes in tax laws regulations future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record as well as our capital deployment strategy which could adversely affect our results of operationsdue to the extensive nature of our foreign operations fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operationsa growing percentage of our total revenues approximately 20 in 2015 is derived from markets outside the united states we sell a majority of our products in transactions denominated in us dollars however we purchase many of our raw materials pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies as a result when the us dollar weakens against any of these currencies our cost of sales could increase substantially outside the united states we may pay for materials or finished products in us dollars and in some cases a strengthening of the us dollar could effectively increase our costs where we use foreign currency to purchase the us dollars we need to make such payments changes on foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates however no hedging strategy can completely insulate us from foreign exchange risk we are also exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our financial statements due to the translation of operating results and financial position of our foreign subsidiaries11table of contentsinability to access sufficient capital at reasonable rates or commercially reasonable terms or maintain sufficient liquidity in the amounts and at the times needed could adversely impact our businesswe rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing

debt capital from outside sources in order to efficiently fund the cash flow needs of our business and pursue strategic acquisitions although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt at a reasonable cost when necessary the ability to have continued access to reasonably priced credit is dependent upon our current and future capital structure financial performance our credit ratings and general economic conditions if we are unable to access the capital markets at a reasonable economic cost it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial conditionwe are subject to certain risks as a result of our

expenditures or acquisitions meet our debt payment obligations and capital commitments fund any operating losses or future development of our business affiliates obtain lower borrowing costs that are available from secured lenders or engage in advantageous transactions that monetize our assets or conduct other necessary or prudent corporate activities any failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default that accelerates the maturity of our indebtedness under such facilities resulting in an adverse effect on our businessthe lenders under the senior secured credit facility have received a pledge of substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries with certain customary or agreedupon exceptions for foreign subsidiaries

the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other systems and operations while our operational size the diversity of locations from which we operate and our redundant backup systems provide us with a strong advantage should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event we could still experience operational challenges in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel in our technology group if we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or be unable to deliver products to our customers these events could result in reputational damage lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns all of the foregoing can have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows12table of contentsour operations in international markets and our earnings in those markets may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risksduring 2015 net sales from our international segment were 11 billion representing approximately 20 of total net sales in addition a significant amount of our manufacturing and production operations are located or our products are sourced from outside the united states as a result our business is subject to risks associated with international operations these risks include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations unexpected changes in tariffs taxes or regulatory requirements and political unrest and corruptionregulatory changes could limit the countries in which we sell produce or source our products or significantly increase the cost of operating in or obtaining materials originating from certain countries restrictions imposed by such changes can have a particular impact on our business when after we have moved our operations to a particular location new unfavorable regulations are enacted in that area or favorable regulations currently in effect are changedcountries in which our products are manufactured or sold may from time

employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business reputation and operating resultseconomic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers suppliers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flowsalthough the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers discretionary spending is affected by many factors that are outside of our control including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation energy prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending reduced sales at our wholesale customers may lead to lower retail inventory levels reduced orders to us or order cancellations these lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets may result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this may result in higher credit risk relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flowsin addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our suppliers of raw materials and finished goods logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and derivatives transactions in addition the inability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on which we rely for raw materials finished goods or services are unable to overcome financial difficulties and provide us

business needs we cannot assure you that our management will be able to manage these projects effectively or implement them successfully if we miscalculate the resources or time we need to complete a project or fail to implement the project effectively our business and operating results could be adversely affected we rely on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales and the loss of or material reduction in sales to any of our top customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flowsin 2015 our top 10 customers accounted for 56 of our net sales and our top two customers walmart and target accounted for 23 and 15 of our net sales respectively we expect that these customers will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales in the future moreover our top customers are the largest market participants in our primary distribution channels across all of our product lines we generally do not enter into purchase agreements that obligate our customers to purchase our products and as a result most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis a decision by any of our top customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from us could substantially reduce revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial

business any such reduction in apparel selling space could result in lower sales and our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affectedthe loss of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw materials may interrupt our supplies and materially harm our businesswe purchase all of the raw materials used in our products and approximately 35 of the cost of sales derived from apparel designed by us from a limited number of third party suppliers and manufacturers our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of raw materials and finished products from our third party suppliers and manufacturers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of our principal third party suppliers or manufacturers experience financial difficulties that they are not able to overcome resulting from worldwide economic conditions production problems difficulties in sourcing raw materials lack of capacity or transportation disruptions or if for these or other reasons they raise the prices of the raw materials or finished products we purchase from them the magnitude of this risk depends upon the timing of any interruptions the materials or products that the third party manufacturers provide and the volume of productionour dependence on third parties for raw materials and finished products subjects us to the risk of supplier failure and customer dissatisfaction with the quality of our products quality failures by our third party manufacturers or changes in their financial or business condition that affect their production could disrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers and thereby materially harm our businessour business depends on our senior management team and other key personnelour success depends upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel some of whom have unique talents and experience and would be difficult to replace the loss or interruption of the services of a member of our senior management team or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business during the transitional period that would be required for a successor to assume the responsibilities of the position our future success will also depend on our

to provide them with some of our products on an exclusive basis which could cause an increase in the number of stock keeping units or skus we must carry and consequently increase our inventory levels and working capital requirements moreover our customers may increasingly seek markdown allowances incentives and other forms of economic support which reduce our gross margins and affect our profitability our financial performance is negatively affected by these pricing pressures when we are forced to reduce our prices without being able to correspondingly reduce our production coststhe success of our business is tied to the strength and reputation of our brands including brands that we license to other parties if other parties take actions that weaken harm the reputation of or cause confusion with our brands our business and consequently our sales results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affectedwe license some of our important trademarks to third parties for example we license champion to third parties for athleticoriented accessories although we make concerted efforts to protect our brands through quality control mechanisms and contractual obligations imposed on our licensees there is a risk that some licensees may not be in full compliance with those mechanisms and obligations in that event or if a licensee engages in behavior with respect to the licensed

of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks we are from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some items of our intellectual propertymarket returns could have a negative impact on the return on plan assets for our pension which may require significant fundingthe plan assets of our pension plans which had a loss of approximately 3 during 2015 and a return of approximately 4 during 2014 are invested mainly in domestic and international equities bonds and real estate we are unable to predict the variations in asset values or the severity or duration of any disruptions in the financial markets or adverse economic conditions in the united states europe and asia the funded status of these plans and the related cost reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty particularly in the current economic environment under the pension protection act of 2006 the pension protection act losses of asset values may necessitate increased funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements under the pension protection act funding rules our us qualified pension plan is approximately 104 funded as of january 2 2016 any downward pressure on the asset values of these plans may require us to fund obligations earlier than we had originally planned which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operationsour balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as a noncash expense in our consolidated statement of incomegoodwill trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually the fair value of the goodwill assigned to a business unit could decline if projected revenues or cash flows were to be lower in the future due to effects of the global economy or other causes if the carrying value of intangible assets or of goodwill were to exceed its fair value the asset would be written down to its fair value with the impairment loss recognized as a noncash charge in the consolidated statement of incomeas of january 2 2016 we had approximately 834 million of goodwill and 701 million of trademarks and other identifiable intangibles on our balance sheet which together represent 27 of our total assets no impairment was identified in 2015 changes in the future outlook of a business

the assets and liabilities in the calculation of taxable income the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax benefits will not be realized if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets which would cause an increase in our effective tax rate a significant increase in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of

foreign laws governing our relationships with our employees including wage and hour laws and regulations fair labor standards minimum wage requirements overtime pay unemployment tax rates workers

market position by units sold in most product categories in which we competeacquisitionson april 6 2015 we acquired knights apparel a leading seller of licensed collegiate logo apparel primarily in the mass retail channel from merit capital partners the acquisition was an all cash transaction valued at approximately 193 million on an enterprise value basis the acquisition was funded with cash on hand and shortterm borrowings under our revolving loan facility we believe the acquisition will create growth and cost savings opportunities through utilizing our lowcost supply chain the operating results of knights apparel from the date of acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements and are reported as part of our activewear segmentwe incurred 266 million of charges in

million our segments our operations are managed and reported in four operating segments each of which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes innerwear activewear direct to consumer and international these segments are organized principally by product category geographic location and distribution channel each segment has its own management that is responsible for the operations

billion to 59 billioninterest expense and other related expense are expected to be approximately 115 million to 120 millionwe estimate our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 10 and 11 with the rates expected to vary by quarterwe expect cash flow from operations to be in the range of 750 million to 850 million net capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 70 million and dividend payments are expected to be roughly 175 million business and industry trendsinflation and changing pricescotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products while we do not own yarn operations we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our largescale yarn suppliers and may result in the need to implement future price increases in order to maintain our margins decreases in cotton prices can lead to lower margins for inventory and products produced from cotton we have already purchased particularly if there is downward price pressure as a result of consumer demand competition or other factors our costs for cotton yarn and cottonbased textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton which is affected by among other factors weather consumer demand speculation on the commodities market the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control we are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton under our agreements with these suppliers we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases when we elect to fix the cotton cost component under these agreements interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of yarn the yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is their responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton suppliers however our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices the cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us represented only approximately 7 of our cost of sales in 2015 costs incurred today for materials and labor including cotton typically do not impact our results until the inventory is sold approximately six to nine months laterinflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins for example the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process such as oilrelated commodities and other raw materials such as dyes and chemicals and other costs such as fuel energy and utility costs can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold in addition a significant portion of our products are manufactured in countries other than the united states and declines in the value of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs increases in inflation may not be matched by rises in consumer income which also could have a negative impact on spendingother business and industry trendsthe basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price product quality selection service and purchasing convenience the majority of our core styles continue from year to year with variations only in color fabric or design details some products however such as intimate apparel activewear and sheer hosiery do have more of an emphasis on style and innovation our businesses face competition from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers as well as smaller companies department stores specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands26table of contentsour top 10 customers accounted for 56 of our net sales our largest customers in 2015 were walmart target and kohls which accounted for 23 15 and 5 of total sales respectively the increasing bargaining power of retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek greater concessions in their purchase of our products while also demanding exclusivity of some of our products to counteract these effects it has become increasingly important to leverage our national brands through investment in our largest and strongest brands as our customers strive to maximize their performance especially in todays challenging economic environment brands are important in our core categories to drive traffic and project the quality and value our customers demandchanges in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies can impact our financial results in two ways a translation impact and a transaction impact the translation impact refers to the impact that changes in exchange rates can have on our published financial results similar to many multinational corporations that publish financial results in us dollars our revenue and profit earned in local foreign currencies is translated back into us dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period a period of strengthening in the us dollar results in a negative impact to our published financial results because it would take more units of a local currency to convert into a dollar the opposite is true during a period of weakening in the us dollar our biggest foreign currency exposure is the euro the transaction impact on financial results is common for apparel companies that source goods because these goods are purchased in us dollars the transaction impact from a strengthening dollar would be negative to our financial results because the us dollarbased costs would convert into a higher amount of local currency units which means a higher localcurrency cost of goods and in turn a lower localcurrency gross profit the transaction impact from exchange rates is typically recovered over time with price increases however during periods of rapid change in exchange rates pricing is unable to change quickly enough therefore we hedge against our sourcing costs to minimize our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates our key business strategiesour innovatetoelevate strategy integrates our brand superiority industryleading innovation and lowcost supply chain to provide higher valued products while lowering production costs the first element of our innovatetoelevate strategy is our brand power we seek to drive modest sales growth by consistently offering consumers brands they trust and products with unsurpassed value our brands have a strong heritage in the basic apparel industry our brands hold either the number one or number two us market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete internationally our commercial markets include europe japan canada mexico brazil and australia where a substantial amount of gross domestic product growth outside the united states

in order to drive further economies of scale the third element of our innovatetoelevate strategy is our lowcost global supply chain we seek to expand margins through optimizing our lowcost global supply chain and streamlining our operations to reduce costs we believe that we are able to leverage our significant scale of operations to provide us with greater manufacturing efficiencies purchasing power and product design marketing and customer management resources than our smaller competitors our global supply chain spans across both the western and eastern hemispheres and provides us with a balanced approach to product supply which relies on a combination of owned contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions increases the efficiency of our operations reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply our global supply chain enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres thereby diversifying our production risks we have generated significant cost savings margin expansion and contributions to cash flow and should continue to do so as we further optimize our size scale and production capability we seek to effectively generate strong cash flow through optimizing our capital structure and managing working capital levels our capital allocation strategy is to effectively deploy our significant consistent cash flow to generate the best long27table of contentsterm returns for our shareholders our goal is to use our cash flow to fund capital investments and dividends leverage debt for acquisitions and use excess cash flow for share repurchasesseasonality and other factorsour operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors generally our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items we generally have higher sales during the backtoschool and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather which benefits certain product categories such as fleece sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us media advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductionsalthough the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers discretionary spending is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit taxation gasoline prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside our control consumers purchases of discretionary items including our products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions these consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or to purchase lowerpriced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to timechanges in product sales mix can impact our gross profit as the percentage of our sales attributable to higher margin products such as intimate apparel and mens underwear and lower margin products such as activewear fluctuate from time to time in addition sales attributable to higher and lower margin products within the same product category fluctuate from time to time our customers may change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us which makes trends in product sales mix difficult to predict however certain changes in product sales mix are seasonal in nature as sales of socks hosiery and fleece products generally have higher sales during the last two quarters july to december of each fiscal year as a result of cooler weather backtoschool shopping and holidays while other changes in product mix may be attributable to customers preferences and discretionary spending2015 highlightsnet sales in 2015 were 57 billion compared with 53 billion in 2014 representing an 8 increaseoperating profit was 595 million in 2015 compared with 564 million in

dependent on net income and changes in working capital although net income increased in 2015 from improved operating performance cash flow provided by operating activities decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the followingthe build in inventory levels in 2015 in 2016 we expect to reduce our inventory levels through adjustments to our manufacturing production schedule internalizing additional production and by drawing down our raw materials and workinprocess100 million pension contribution in 2015 and37table of contentsdecreased accounts receivable collections in 2015 due to the timing of sales within the fourth quarter yearoveryearinvesting activitiesthe lower net cash used for investing activities was primarily the result of the net cash of 193 million used for the acquisition of knights apparel in april 2015 as compared to the net cash used for the acquisition of hanes europe innerwear in august 2014 of 360 million and 2014 proceeds from the sale of investments of 64 million offset by higher net capital expenditures of 27 million in 2015financing activitiesthe higher net cash from financing activities was primarily the result of higher net cash borrowings on our loan facilities specifically new borrowings under the senior secured credit facility the decision to increase our net borrowings was driven by our cash deployment strategy and utilized for acquisitions share repurchases and quarterly dividends in order to continue generating shareholder value financing arrangements we believe our financing structure provides a secure base to support our operations and key business strategies as of january 2 2016 we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit facilities and other outstanding indebtedness discussed below we continue to monitor our covenant compliance carefully in this difficult economic environment we expect to maintain compliance with our covenants during 2016 however economic conditions or the occurrence of events discussed above under risk factors could cause noncompliancewe have significant liquidity from our available cash balances and credit facilities we maintain a senior secured credit facility the senior secured credit facility consisting of a revolving loan facility of 1000000 a 725000 term loan a facility the term loan a a 425000 term loan b facility the term loan b and a 363000 euro term loan

our credit facilitiesnotes payablenotes payable were 118 million at january 2 2016 and 144 million at january 3 2015 at january 2 2016 we had 110 million of borrowing availability under our international loan facilities undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiariesas of january 2 2016 the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries was approximately 27 billion of which 319 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested and less than 1 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are not considered permanently reinvested our intention is to reinvest the cash and cash equivalents of those entities whose undistributed earnings we have previously asserted as being permanently reinvested in our international operations we reassess our reinvestment assertions each reporting period and currently believe that we have sufficient other sources of liquidity to support our assertion that such undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be considered to be reinvested permanentlywe repatriated 124 million 15 million and 10 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively from earnings generated in such years the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated in the past has been determined and the amount that we expect to repatriate during 2016 will be determined based upon a variety of factors including current year earnings of the foreign subsidiaries foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the us such as for the repayment of debt and other domestic obligations the majority of our repatriation of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries has historically occurred at yearend although we may always repatriate funds earlier in the year based on the needs of our business when we repatriate funds to the us we are required to pay taxes on these amounts based on applicable us tax rates net of any foreign tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against us income tax there was a cost of 43 million 1 million and 1 million in additional us federal income taxes in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in such years 38table of contentscritical accounting policies and estimateswe have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies to our financial statementsthe application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures these estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors are described belowsales recognition and incentiveswe recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement ii the sales price is fixed or determinable iii title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured which occurs primarily upon shipment we record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and current customer information our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experiencenote summary of significant accounting policies d summary of significant accounting policies  sales recognition and incentives to our financial statements describes a variety of sales incentives that we offer to resellers and consumers of our products measuring the cost of these incentives requires in many cases estimating future customer utilization and redemption rates we use historical data for similar transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive programs our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience and other available information we classify the costs associated with cooperative advertising as a reduction of net sales in our consolidated statements of incomeaccounts receivable valuationaccounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers we carry our accounts receivable at their net realizable value in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the selling general and administrative expenses line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are primarily reflected as a reduction in the net sales line of our consolidated statements of income our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a large reserve might be required the amount of actual historical losses has not varied materially from our estimates for bad debtsinventory valuationwe carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout or fifo method for our inventories we carry obsolete damaged and excess inventory at the net realizable value which we determine by assessing historical recovery rates current market conditions and our future marketing and sales plans because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time there are inherent uncertainties related to our value determination market factors and other conditions underlying the net realizable value may change resulting in further reserve requirements a reduction in the carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be reversed at a later period while we believe that adequate writedowns for inventory obsolescence have been provided in the financial statements consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory writedowns in the futurerebates discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold39table of contentsincome taxesdeferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of our assets and liabilities as well as for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies if in our judgment it appears that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets which increase income tax expense in the period when such determination is madewe have not provided federal income taxes on that portion of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings that is permanently reinvested in their respective foreign jurisdictions if we decided to remit those earnings to the us in a future period due to anticipated cash flow or other business requirements our federal income tax provision and effective tax rate could be impactedwe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution these assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits expiration of statutes of limitations as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations income tax expense is adjusted in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which these events occurstock compensationwe

pension plansfor a discussion of our net periodic benefit cost plan obligations plan assets and how we measure the amount of these costs see note defined benefit pension plans to our consolidated financial statements the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans are recognized on our balance sheet differences between actual results in a given year and the actuarially determined assumed results for that year are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in comprehensive income we measure the funded status of our plans as of the date of our fiscal year endthe net periodic cost of the pension plans is determined using projections and actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the longterm rate of asset return the net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in the year incurred gains and losses which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions are amortized over the average future expected life of participants as benefits under the hanesbrands inc pension plan are frozen year over year fluctuations in our pension expense are not expected to be material and not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as followsin determining the discount rate we utilized the aon hewitt aa above median curve rounded to the nearest 10 basis points in order to determine a unique interest rate for each plan and match the expected cash flows for each plan beginning in 2016 we will begin utilizing specific spot rates along the full yield curve in our determination of discount rates for our us defined benefit plans in order to determine our interest rate and match to the relevant cash flows for the plans this change will improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of interest costssalary increase assumptions were based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions the salary increase assumption only applies to the canadian plans certain hanes europe innerwear plans and portions of the hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans as benefits under these plans are not frozen the benefits under the hanesbrands inc pension plan were frozen as of december 31 200540table of contentsin determining the longterm rate of return on plan assets we applied a proportionally weighted blend between assuming the historical longterm compound growth rate of the plan portfolio would predict the future returns of similar investments and the utilization of forwardlooking assumptionsretirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while standard actuarial tables were used to estimate mortality in 2015 the tables used as a basis for the mortality assumption were updated from the rp2000 table and aa scale to the rp2015 table and mp2015 scale respectivelythe sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans benefit obligations all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following

investment return8 natrademarks and other identifiable intangiblestrademarks license agreements customer and distributor relationships and computer software are our primary identifiable intangible assets we amortize identifiable intangibles with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and we do not amortize identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives we base the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors including the effects of demand competition expected changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows as of january 2 2016 the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was 701 million of which we are amortizing a balance of 211 million we anticipate that our amortization expense for 2016 will be 20 millionwe evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate asset amortization described below under  depreciation and impairment of property plant and equipment we assess identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter and more often as triggering events occur in order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets we compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount fair values of intangible assets are primarily based on future cash flows projected to be generated from that asset we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which an identifiable intangible assets carrying value exceeds its fair value goodwillas of january 2 2016 we had 834 million of goodwill we do not amortize goodwill but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur the timing of our annual goodwill impairment testing is the first day of the third fiscal quarter the estimated fair values significantly exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter and no impairment of goodwill was identified as a result of the testing conducted in 2015in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill in 2015 we estimated the fair value of our reporting units we relied on a number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results business plans and present value techniques as discussed above under trademarks and other identifiable intangibles there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them and the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes knownassets and liabilities acquired in business combinationswe account for business combinations using the purchase method which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date we recognize the excess of an acquired business cost over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as goodwill we use a variety of information sources to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities we generally use third party appraisers to determine the fair value and lives of property and identifiable intangibles consulting actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans and legal counsel to assess obligations associated with legal and environmental claims41table of contentsdepreciation and impairment of property plant and equipmentwe state property plant and equipment at its historical cost and we compute depreciation using the straightline method over the assets life we estimate an assets life based on historical experience manufacturers estimates engineering or appraisal evaluations our future business plans and the period over which the asset will economically benefit us which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life our policies require that we periodically review our assets remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization a change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periodswe test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable such events include significant adverse changes in business climate several periods of operating or cash flow losses forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life we evaluate an assets recoverability by comparing the asset or asset groups net carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset or asset group will generate if we determine that an asset is not recoverable we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair valuewhen we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use we depreciate the assets adjusted carrying amount over its remaining useful life we do not restore previously recognized impairment losses if circumstances changerecently issued

control system uses analytical techniques including market value sensitivity analysis and value at risk estimationsforeign exchange riskwe sell the majority of our products in transactions denominated in us dollars however we purchase some raw materials pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies our exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with respect to the euro canadian dollar australian dollar mexican peso and japanese yen against the us dollar we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates a sensitivity analysis technique has been used to evaluate the effect that changes in the market value of foreign exchange currencies will have on our forward and

ratesour debt under the revolving loan facility accounts receivable securitization facility term loan a term loan b euro term loan and other international debt bears interest at variable rates as a

point movement in the annual interest rate charged on the outstanding debt balances as of january 2 2016 would only result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately 4 millioncommoditieswe are exposed to commodity price fluctuations primarily as a result of the cost of materials that are used in our manufacturing process cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products under our current agreements with our primary yarn suppliers we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases so that the suppliers bear the risk of cotton price fluctuation for the specified yarn volume and interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact our costs however our business can be affected by sustained dramatic movements in cotton prices in addition fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices may influence the prices of other raw materials we use to manufacture our products such as chemicals dyestuffs polyester yarn and foam as well as affect our transportation and utility costs we generally purchase raw materials at market prices 42table of contents item 8financial statements

evaluating elements of property identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter and as triggering events occur the impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount if the

goodwillgoodwill is the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination when a business combination is completed the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are assigned to the reporting unit or units of the company given responsibility for managing controlling and generating returns on these assets and liabilities in many instances all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities are assigned to a single reporting unit and in these cases all of the goodwill is assigned to the same reporting unit in those situations in which the acquired assets and liabilities are allocated to more than one reporting unit the goodwill to be assigned to each reporting unit is determined in a manner similar to how the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determinedgoodwill is not amortized however it is assessed for impairment at least annually and as triggering events occur the companys annual measurement date is the first day of the third fiscal quarter in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units and compares it to the carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the next step of the process involves comparing the implied fair value to the carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit if the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess no

goal of reducing the risk or cost to the company depending on the nature of the underlying risk being hedged these financial instruments are either designated as cash flow hedges or are economic hedges against changes in the value of the hedged item and therefore not designated as hedges for accounting purposes the company does not use derivatives for trading purposes and is not a party to

primary investment objective are to maximize the principal value of the plan assets to meet current and future benefit obligations to plan participants and their beneficiaries to accomplish this goal the assets of the plan are broadly diversified to protect against large investment losses and to reduce the likelihood of excessive volatility of returns diversification of assets is achieved through strategic allocations to various asset classes as well as various investment styles within these asset classes and by retaining multiple third party investment management firms with complementary investment styles and philosophies to implement these allocations the company has established a target asset allocation based upon analysis of riskreturn tradeoffs and correlations of asset mixes given longterm historical data prospective capital market returns and forecasted liabilities of the plans the target asset allocation approximates the actual asset allocation as of january 2 2016 in addition to volatility protection diversification enables the assets of the plan the best opportunity to provide adequate returns in order to meet the companys investment return objectives these objectives include over a rolling 5year period to achieve a total return that exceeds the required actuarial rate of return for the plan and to outperform a passive portfolio consisting of a similar

component of net periodic benefit costs for the companys us defined benefit plans from using a single discount rate as discussed above the company has elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the interest component of benefit costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligations to the relevant projected cash flows the company will make this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of interest costs this change will not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in interest costs is completely offset by the actuarial gain or loss reported the company will account for this change as a change in estimate and accordingly will account for it prospectively beginning in 2016 f35table of contentshanesbrands incnotes to consolidated financial statements
