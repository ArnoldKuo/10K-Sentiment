distributionduring 2016 approximately 72 of units sold were from finished goods manufactured through a combination of facilities we own and operate and facilities owned and operated by third party contractors who perform some of the steps in the manufacturing process for us such as cutting andor sewing we sourced the remainder of our finished goods from third party manufacturers who supply us with finished products based on our designs in making decisions about the location of manufacturing operations and third party sources of supply we consider a number of factors including labor local operating costs quality regional infrastructure applicable quotas and duties and freight costs we believe that our balanced approach to product supply which relies on a combination of owned contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions increases the efficiency of our operations reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supplyfinished goods that are manufactured by hanesbrandsthe manufacturing process for the finished goods that we manufacture begins with raw materials we obtain from suppliers the principal raw materials in our product categories are cotton and synthetics cotton and synthetic materials are typically spun into yarn which is then knitted into cotton synthetic and blended fabrics we source all of our yarn requirements from largescale domestic and international suppliers to a lesser extent we purchase fabric from several domestic and international suppliers in conjunction with scheduled production in addition to cotton yarn and cottonbased textiles we use thread narrow elastic and trim for product identification buttons zippers snaps and lace these fabrics are cut and sewn into finished products either by us or by third party contractors we currently operate 52 manufacturing facilities most of our cutting and sewing operations are strategically located in asia central america and the caribbean basin alternate sources of these materials and services are readily availablefinished goods that are manufactured by third partiesin addition to our manufacturing capabilities we also source finished goods we design from thirdparty manufacturers also referred to as turnkey products many of these turnkey products are sourced from international suppliers by our strategic sourcing hubs in asia5table of contentsall contracted and sourced manufacturing must meet our high quality standards further all contractors and thirdparty manufacturers must be preaudited and adhere to our strict supplier and business practices guidelines these requirements provide strict standards that among other things cover hours of work age of workers health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws and hanesbrands standards each new supplier must be inspected and agree to comprehensive compliance terms prior to performance of any production on our behalf we audit compliance with these standards and maintain strict compliance performance records in addition to our audit procedures many of our suppliers are certified by the worldwide responsible accredited production or wrap program wrap uses thirdparty independent audit firms and requires factorybyfactory certification we are also a fully accredited participating company in the fair labor associationdistributionas of december 31 2016 we

we sell our products we internally manage and operate 32 of these facilities and we use third party logistics providers who operate the other 12 facilities on our behalf international distribution operations use a combination of third party logistics providers as well as owned and operated distribution operations to distribute goods to our various international marketsinventoryeffective inventory management is key to our success because our customers generally do not purchase our products under longterm supply contracts but rather on a purchase order basis effective inventory management requires close coordination with the customer base we seek to ensure that products are available to meet customer demands while effectively managing inventory levels we employ various types of inventory management techniques that include collaborative forecasting and planning suppliermanaged inventory key event management and various forms of replenishment management processes our suppliermanaged inventory initiative is intended to shift raw material ownership and management to our suppliers until consumption freeing up cash and improving response time we have demand management planners in our customer management group who work closely with customers to develop demand forecasts that are passed to the supply chain we also have professionals within the customer management group who coordinate daily with our larger customers to help ensure that our customers planned inventory levels are in fact available at their individual retail outlets additionally within our supply chain organization we have dedicated professionals who translate the demand forecast into our inventory strategy and specific production plans these individuals work closely with our customer management team to balance inventory investmentexposure with customer service targetsseasonality and other factorsour operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors for instance we generally have higher sales during the backtoschool and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather which benefits certain product categories such as fleece our diverse range of product offerings however provides some mitigation to the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us media advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductionsproduct innovation and marketinga significant component of our marginenhancing innovatetoelevate strategy is our strong product research and development and innovation capabilities from 2014 to 2016 we spent nearly 196 million on design research and product development including the development of new and improved productswe use a disciplined consumerdriven approach

currently are not known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may adversely affect our businesses and operationswe operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market and our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively in the futurethe basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly competition is generally based upon brand comfort fit style and price our businesses face competition today from other large domestic and foreign corporations and 9table of contentsmanufacturers as well as department stores and other retailers including many of our customers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands also online retail shopping is rapidly evolving and we expect competition in the ecommerce market to intensify in the future as the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our customers our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted increased competition may result in a loss of or a reduction in shelf space and promotional support and reduced prices in each case decreasing our cash flows operating margins and profitability our ability to identify and capitalize on retail trends including technology ecommerce and other process efficiencies to gain market share and better service our customer base will in large part determine our future success if we fail to compete successfully our market share results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affectedany inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure with respect to our information technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our businessour ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively and support global growth and expansion problems with integrating various data sources challenges in transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of our business hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate largescale and complex automated attacks any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data misappropriation of our consumers or employees personal information or a disruption of our business which could give rise to unwanted media attention materially damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales fines or lawsuitsmoreover we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations proceedings against us by governmental entities or others damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profitsdue to the extensive nature of our foreign operations fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operationsa growing percentage of our total revenues approximately 26 in 2016 is derived from markets outside the united states we sell a majority of our products in transactions denominated in us dollars however we purchase many of our raw materials pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies as a result when the us dollar weakens against any of these currencies our cost of sales could increase substantially outside the united states we may pay for materials or finished products in us dollars and in some cases a strengthening of the us dollar could effectively increase our costs where we use foreign currency to purchase the us dollars we need to make such payments changes on foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates however no hedging strategy can completely insulate us from foreign exchange risk we are also exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our financial statements due to the translation of operating results and financial position of our foreign subsidiariesthe rapidly changing retail environment could result in the loss of or material reduction in sales to certain of our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flowsthe retail environment is highly competitive consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications as a result a greater portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers is occurring online and through mobile commerce applications if our brickandmortar retail customers fail to maintain or grow their overall market position through the integration of physical retail presence and digital retail these customers may experience financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this could in turn substantially reduce our revenues increase our credit risk and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows10table of contentswe have a complex multinational tax structure and changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could impact our capital deployment strategy and adversely affect our resultswe have a complex multinational tax structure with multiple types of intercompany transactions and our allocation of profits and losses among us and our subsidiaries through our intercompany transfer pricing agreements is subject to review by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in order to service our debt obligations we may need to increase the portion of the income our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the united states which may significantly increase our income tax expense in addition we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns and related transfer pricing documentation by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition additionally changes in tax laws regulations future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record as well as our capital deployment strategy which could adversely affect our results of operationsour failure to properly manage strategic projects in order to achieve the desired results may negatively impact our businessthe implementation of our business strategy periodically involves the execution of complex projects which places significant demands on our management accounting financial information and other systems and on our business our ability to successfully implement such projects is dependent on managements ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to our changing business needs we cannot assure you that our management will be able to manage these projects effectively or implement them successfully if we miscalculate the resources or time we need to complete a project or fail to implement the project effectively our business and operating results could be adversely affectedour business depends on our senior management team and other key personnelour success depends upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel some of whom have unique talents and experience and would be difficult to replace the loss or interruption of the services of a member of our senior management team or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business during the transitional period that would be required for a successor to assume the responsibilities of the position our future success will also depend on our ability to develop andor recruit employees with the core competencies needed to support our growth in global markets and in new products or services we may not be able to attract or retain these employees which could adversely affect our businessour operations in international markets and our earnings in those markets may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risksduring 2016 net sales from our international segment were 15 billion representing approximately 26 of total net sales in addition a significant amount of our manufacturing and production operations are located or our products are sourced from outside the united states as a result our business is subject to risks associated with international operations these risks include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations unexpected changes in tariffs taxes or regulatory requirements and political unrest and corruptionregulatory changes could limit the countries in which we sell produce or source our products or significantly increase the cost of operating in or obtaining materials originating from certain countries restrictions imposed by such changes can have a particular impact on our business when after we have moved our operations to a particular location new unfavorable regulations are enacted in that area or favorable regulations currently in effect are changedcountries in which our products are manufactured or sold may from time to time impose additional new regulations or modify existing regulations includingchanges in duties taxes tariffs and other charges on importslimitations on the quantity of goods which may be imported into the united states from a particular countryrequirements as to where products andor inputs are manufactured or sourcedcreation of export licensing requirements imposition of restrictions on export quantities or specification of minimum export pricing andor export prices or duties11table of contentslimitations on foreign owned businesses orgovernment actions to cancel contracts redenominate the official currency renounce or default on obligations renegotiate terms unilaterally or expropriate assetsin addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operationsrecently political discourse in the united states has increasingly focused on ways to discourage us corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions many prominent government officials have publicly addressed the need to discourage these practices through television new publications and social media platforms including through the possibility of imposing tariffs border adjustments or other penalties on goods manufactured outside the united states to attempt to discourage these practices it has also been suggested that the united states may materially modify or withdraw from some of its existing trade agreements any of these actions if ultimately enacted could adversely affect our results of operations or profitability further our image the reputation of our brands and our stock price may be adversely affected if we are publicly singled out for criticism by government officials as a result of our foreign operationswe are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act in addition to the anticorruption laws of the foreign countries in which we operate although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business reputation and operating resultsin addition in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as brexit this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the european union and this uncertainty may persist for years a withdrawal could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in europe the united kingdoms vote to exit the european union could also result in similar referendums or votes in other european countries in which we do business the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the united kingdoms withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products including our products any of these effects among others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition significant fluctuations and volatility in the price of various input costs such as cotton and oilrelated materials utilities freight and wages may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flowsinflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins for example the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process such as oilrelated commodity prices and other raw materials such as dyes and chemicals and other costs such as fuel energy and utility costs can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors similarly a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the value of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs sudden decreases in the costs for materials including cotton may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production which could result in lower profitability particularly if these decreases result in downward price pressure if in the future we incur volatility in the costs for materials including cotton and labor that we are unable to offset through price adjustments or improved efficiencies or if our competitors unwillingness to follow our price changes results in downward price pressure our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affectedinability to access sufficient capital at reasonable rates or commercially reasonable terms or maintain sufficient liquidity in the amounts and at the times needed could adversely impact our businesswe rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our revolving loan facility and other external debt financings to meet the cash requirements of our business we have significant capital requirements and will need continued access to debt capital from outside sources in order to efficiently fund the cash flow needs of our business and pursue strategic acquisitions although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt at a reasonable cost when necessary the ability to have continued access to reasonably priced credit is dependent upon our current and future capital structure 12table of contentsfinancial performance our credit ratings and general economic conditions if we are unable to access the capital markets at a reasonable economic cost it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial conditionour reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partnersour business is subject to federal state local and international laws rules and regulations such as state and local wage and hour laws the us foreign corrupt practices act the false claims act the employee retirement income security act erisa securities laws import and export laws including customs regulations unclaimed property laws and many others we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any violations of law or improper conduct could damage our reputation and depending on the circumstances subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows and the market value of our stockthe loss of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw materials may interrupt our supplies and materially harm our businesswe purchase all of the raw materials used in our products and approximately 28 of the units sold derived from apparel designed by us from a limited number of third party suppliers and manufacturers our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of raw materials and finished products from our third party suppliers and manufacturers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of our principal third party suppliers or manufacturers experience financial difficulties that they are not able to overcome resulting from worldwide economic conditions production problems difficulties in sourcing raw materials lack of capacity or transportation disruptions or if for these or other reasons they raise the prices of the raw materials or finished products we purchase from them the magnitude of this risk depends upon the timing of any interruptions the materials or products that the third party manufacturers provide and the volume of productionour dependence on third parties for raw materials and finished products subjects us to the risk of supplier failure and customer dissatisfaction with the quality of our products quality failures by our third party manufacturers or changes in their financial or business condition that affect their production could disrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers and thereby materially harm our businessour ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses could impact our financial resultsas a leading branded apparel company we expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions as part of our longterm business strategy such as our recent acquisitions of champion europe and hanes australasia difficulties may arise in the integration of the business and operations of businesses that we acquire and as a result we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and synergies that we expect will result from such transactions achieving cost savings is dependent on consolidating certain operational and functional areas eliminating duplicative positions and terminating certain agreements for outside services additional operational savings are dependent upon the conversion of core operating systems data systems and products and the standardization of business practices complications or difficulties in the conversion of core operating systems data systems and products may result in the loss of customers operational problems onetime costs currently not anticipated or reduced cost savings resulting from such acquisitions annual cost savings in each such transaction may be materially less than anticipated if the closing of the acquisition is delayed unexpectedly the integration of operations is delayed beyond what is anticipated or the conversion to a single set of data systems is not accomplished on a timely basisacquired businesses may not achieve expected results of operations including expected levels of revenues and may require unanticipated costs and expenditures in addition following completion of an acquisition we may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that we and the acquired business have achieved or might achieve separately acquired businesses may also subject us to liabilities that we were unable to discover in the course of our due diligence and our rights to indemnification from the sellers of such other businesses even if obtained may not be sufficient to offset the relevant liabilities in addition the integration of newly acquired businesses may be expensive and timeconsuming and may not be entirely successful integration of the acquired businesses may also place additional pressures on our systems of internal control over financial reporting the process of integrating the operations of acquired businesses could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel if we are unable to successfully integrate any newly acquired business or if the acquired businesses fail to produce targeted results it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition13table of contentswe may be adversely affected by unseasonal or severe weather conditionsour business may be adversely affected by unseasonable or severe weather conditions periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter or periods of unseasonably cool and wet weather in the spring or summer can negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending in addition severe weather events such as snow storms or hurricanes typically lead to temporarily reduced retail traffic any of these conditions could result in negative pointofsale trends for our merchandise and reduced replenishment shipments to our wholesale customerswe rely on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales and the loss of or material reduction in sales to any of our top customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flowsin 2016 our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 52 of our net sales and our top two customers walmart and target accounted for 20 and 15 of our net sales respectively we expect that these customers will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales in the future moreover our top customers are the largest market participants in our primary distribution channels across all of our product lines we generally do not enter into purchase agreements that obligate our customers to purchase our products and as a result most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis a decision by any of our top customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from us could substantially reduce revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition if any of our customers devote less selling space to apparel products our sales to those customers could be reduced even if we maintain our share of their apparel business any such reduction in apparel selling space could result in lower sales and our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affectedour results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to manage our inventory effectively and accurately forecast demand for our productswe are faced with the constant challenge of balancing our inventory with our ability to meet marketplace needs factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to evolving consumer preferences and trends and to translate these preferences and trends into marketable product offerings as well as unanticipated changes in general economic conditions or other factors which result in cancellations of orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailersinventory reserves can result from the complexity of our supply chain a long manufacturing process and the seasonal nature of certain products we sell a large number of our products to a small number of customers and these customers generally are not required by contract to purchase our goods as a result we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with thirdparty manufacturers before our customers orders are firm if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices which could have an adverse effect on the image and reputation of our brands and negatively impact profitability on the other hand if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or thirdparty manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to our reputation and relationships these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition additionally sudden decreases in the costs for materials including cotton may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production if this occurs it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flow particularly if we hold a large amount of excess inventory excess inventory charges can reduce gross margins or result in operating losses lowered plant and equipment utilization and lowered fixed operating cost absorption all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flowsour inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liabilitywe have a complex global supply chain and distribution network that supports our ability consistently to provide our products to our customers should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake tsunami terrorist attack pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the safety and availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other systems and operations while our operational size the diversity of locations from which we operate and our redundant backup systems provide us with a strong advantage should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event we could still experience operational challenges in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations 14table of contentssuch as key executive officers or personnel in our technology group if we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or be unable to deliver products to our customers these events could result in reputational damage lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns all of the foregoing can have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flowseconomic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers suppliers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flowsalthough the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers discretionary spending is affected by many factors that are outside of our control including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation energy prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending reduced sales at our wholesale customers may lead to lower retail inventory levels reduced orders to us or order cancellations these lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets may result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this may result in higher credit risk relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flowsin addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our suppliers of raw materials and finished goods logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and derivatives transactions in addition the inability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on which we rely for raw materials finished goods or services are unable to overcome financial difficulties and provide us with the materials and services we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities or derivatives transactions do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affectedif we are unsuccessful in establishing effective advertising marketing and promotional programs our sales could be negatively affectedinadequate or ineffective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales additionally if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditionour existing customers may require products on an exclusive basis forms of economic support and other changes that could be harmful to our businesscustomers increasingly may require us to provide them with some of our products on an exclusive basis which could cause an increase in the number of stock keeping units or skus we must carry and consequently increase our inventory levels and working capital requirements moreover our customers may increasingly seek markdown allowances incentives and other forms of economic support which reduce our gross margins and affect our profitability our financial performance is negatively affected by these pricing pressures when we are forced to reduce our prices without being able to correspondingly reduce our production costs15table of contentsthe success of our business is tied to the strength and reputation of our brands including brands that we license to other parties if other parties take actions that weaken

appropriate measures including court actions and administrative proceedings we are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing our intellectual property rights infringement or counterfeiting of our products could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect our business actions we have taken to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the united states or other countries such as changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on our ability to enforce those rightsthe value of our intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks we are from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some items of our intellectual propertywe design manufacture source and sell products under trademarks that are licensed from third parties if any licensor takes actions related to their trademarks that would cause their brands or our company reputational harm our business may be adversely affectedwe design manufacture source and sell a number of our products under trademarks that are licensed from third parties such as our polo ralph lauren mens underwear and our donna karan and dkny intimate apparel because we do not control the brands licensed to us our licensors could make changes to their brands or business models that could result in a significant downturn in a brands business adversely affecting our sales and results of operations if any licensor engages in behavior with respect to the licensed marks that would cause us reputational harm or if any of the brands licensed to us violates the trademark rights of another or are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable we could experience a significant downturn in that brands business adversely affecting our sales and results of operations and we may be required to expend significant amounts on public relations advertising and possibly legal fees17table of contentsour balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as a noncash expense in our consolidated statement of incomegoodwill trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually the fair value of the goodwill assigned to a business unit could decline if projected revenues or cash flows were to be lower in the future due to effects of the global economy or other causes if the carrying value of intangible assets or of goodwill were to exceed its fair value the asset would be written down to its fair value with the impairment loss recognized as a noncash charge in the consolidated statement of incomeas of december 31 2016 we had approximately 11 billion of goodwill and 13 billion of trademarks and other identifiable intangibles on our balance sheet which together represent 35 of our total assets no impairment was identified in 2016 changes in the future outlook of a business unit could result in an impairment loss which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditionour balance sheet includes a significant amount of deferred tax assets we must generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax benefitsas of december 31 2016 we had approximately 414 million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet which represents approximately 6 of our total assets deferred tax assets relate to temporary differences differences between the assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the assets and liabilities in the calculation of taxable income the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax benefits will not be realized if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets which would cause an increase in our effective tax rate a significant increase in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operationswe had approximately 67800 employees worldwide as of december 31 2016 and our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our employees or changes to us or foreign employment regulationswe had approximately 67800 employees worldwide as of december 31 2016 this means we have a significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our employees including wage and hour laws and regulations fair labor standards minimum wage requirements overtime pay unemployment tax rates workers compensation rates citizenship requirements and payroll taxes which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs approximately 60000 of those employees were outside of the united states a significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have employees could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases all of which may cause us to incur additional costs expend resources responding to such increases and lower our marginsin addition approximately 35 of our employees in the united states and a significant number of our international employees are members of labor organizations or are covered by collective bargaining agreements if there were a significant increase in the number of our employees who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements we would become vulnerable to a strike work stoppage or other labor action by these employees that could have an adverse effect on our businessantitakeover provisions of our charter and

implement future price increases in order to maintain our margins decreases in cotton prices can lead to lower margins for inventory and products produced from cotton we have already purchased particularly if there is downward price pressure as a result of consumer demand competition or other factors our costs for cotton yarn and cottonbased textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton which is affected by among other factors weather consumer demand speculation on the commodities market the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control we are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton under our agreements with these suppliers we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases when we elect to fix the cotton cost component under these agreements interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of yarn the yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is 27table of contentstheir responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton suppliers however our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices the cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us represented only approximately 4 of our cost of sales in 2016 costs incurred today for materials and labor including cotton typically do not impact our results until the inventory is sold approximately six to nine months laterinflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins for example the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process such as oilrelated commodities and other raw materials such as dyes and chemicals and other costs such as fuel energy and utility costs can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold in addition a significant portion of our products are manufactured in countries other than the united states and declines in the value of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs increases in inflation may not be matched by rises in consumer income which also could have a negative impact on spendingother business and industry trendsthe basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price product quality selection service and purchasing convenience the majority of our core styles continue from year to year with variations only in color fabric or design details some products however such as intimate apparel activewear and sheer hosiery do have more of an emphasis on style and innovation our businesses face competition from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers as well as smaller companies department stores specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brandsour top 10 customers accounted for 52 of our net sales our largest customers in 2016 were walmart and target which accounted for 20 and 15 of total sales respectively the increasing bargaining power of retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek greater concessions in their purchase of our products while also demanding exclusivity of some of our products to counteract these effects it has become increasingly important to leverage our national brands through investment in our largest and strongest brands as our customers strive to maximize their performance especially in todays challenging economic environment brands are important in our core categories to drive traffic and project the quality and value our customers demandconsumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications as a result an increasing portion of our revenue across all channels is being generated online and through mobile commerce applications we are continuing to develop and expand our omnichannel capabilities to allow a consumer to use more than one channel when making a purchase including instore at one of our retail or outlet stores or those of our retail partners online or with a mobile device through one of our branded websites the website of one of our retail partners or an online pureplay such as amazon in addition to broadening our assortment of product offerings across all online channels we are also increasing the proportion of our media budget dedicated to digital marketingforeign exchange rateschanges in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies can impact our financial results in two ways a translation impact and a transaction impact the translation impact refers to the impact that changes in exchange rates can have on our published financial results similar to many multinational corporations that publish financial results in us dollars our revenue and profit earned in local foreign currencies is translated back into us dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period a period of strengthening in the us dollar results in a negative impact to our published financial results because it would take more units of a local currency to convert into a dollar the opposite is true during a period of weakening in the us dollar our biggest foreign currency exposure is the euro the transaction impact on financial results is common for apparel companies that source goods because these goods are purchased in us dollars the transaction impact from a strengthening dollar would be negative to our financial results because the us dollarbased costs would convert into a higher amount of local currency units which means a higher localcurrency cost of goods and in turn a lower localcurrency gross profit the transaction impact from exchange rates is typically recovered over time with price increases however during periods of rapid change in exchange rates pricing is unable to change quickly enough therefore we hedge against our sourcing costs to minimize our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates our key business strategiesour innovatetoelevate strategy integrates our brand superiority industryleading innovation and lowcost supply chain to provide higher valued products while lowering production costs 28table of contentsthe first element of our innovatetoelevate strategy is our brand power we seek to drive modest sales growth by consistently offering consumers brands they trust and products with unsurpassed value our brands have a strong heritage in the basic apparel industry our brands hold either the number one or number two us market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete internationally our commercial markets include europe australia japan canada mexico and brazil where a substantial amount of gross domestic product growth outside the united states will be concentrated over the next decade our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends is key to our success our design research and product development teams in partnership with our marketing teams drive our efforts to bring innovations to market we seek to leverage our insights into consumer demand in the basic apparel industry to develop new products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing addressing changing customer needs and industry trends we also support our key brands with targeted effective advertising and marketing campaignsthe second element of our innovatetoelevate strategy is platform innovation we are not interested in newness or fashion but rather focus on identifying the longterm megatrends that will impact our categories over the next five to 10 years once we have identified these trends we utilize a disciplined bigidea process to put more science into the art of apparel our approach to innovation is to focus on big platforms our tagless apparel platform comfortflex fit bra platform comfortblend fabric platform temperaturecontrol xtemp fabric platform and freshiq advanced odor protection technology fabric platform incorporate bigidea innovation to span brands product categories business segments retailer and distribution channels and geographies we are focused on driving innovation that is margin accretive and that can leverage our supply chain in order to drive further economies of scale the third element of our innovatetoelevate strategy is our lowcost global supply chain we seek to expand margins through optimizing our lowcost global supply chain and streamlining our operations to reduce costs we believe that we are able to leverage our significant scale of operations to provide us with greater manufacturing efficiencies purchasing power and product design marketing and customer management resources than our smaller competitors our global supply chain spans across both the western and eastern hemispheres and provides us with a balanced approach to product supply which relies on a combination of owned contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions increases the efficiency of our operations reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply our global supply chain enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres thereby diversifying our production risks we have generated significant cost savings margin expansion and contributions to cash flow and should continue to do so as we further optimize our size scale and production capability we seek to effectively generate strong cash flow through optimizing our capital structure and managing working capital levels our capital allocation strategy is to effectively deploy our significant consistent cash flow to generate the best longterm returns for our shareholders our goal is to use our cash flow to fund capital investments and dividends leverage debt for acquisitions and use excess cash flow for share repurchasesseasonality and other factorsour operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors generally our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items we generally have higher sales during the backtoschool and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather which benefits certain product categories such as fleece sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us media advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductionsalthough the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers discretionary spending is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit taxation gasoline prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside our control consumers purchases of discretionary items including our products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions these consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or to purchase lowerpriced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to timechanges in product sales mix can impact our gross profit as the percentage of our sales attributable to higher margin products such as intimate apparel and mens underwear and lower margin products such as activewear fluctuate from time to time in addition sales attributable to higher and lower margin products within the same product category fluctuate from time 29table of contentsto time our customers may change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us which makes trends in product sales mix difficult to predict however certain changes in product sales mix are seasonal in nature as sales of socks hosiery and fleece products generally have higher sales during the last two quarters july to december of each fiscal year as a result of cooler weather backtoschool shopping and holidays while other changes in product mix may be attributable to customers preferences and discretionary spendingtax expenseas a global company we are subject to income taxes and file income tax returns in more than 100 us and foreign jurisdictions each year almost every foreign jurisdiction in which we operate has a lower effective income tax rate than the us for the year ended december 31 2016 a substantial majority of our foreign income was earned by our manufacturing and sourcing operations in el salvador hong kong dominican republic and thailand the relatively lower effective tax rates in these jurisdictions as a result of favorable local tax regimes and various free trade zone agreements significantly reduced our consolidated effective tax rate while we are not currently aware of any material trends in these jurisdictions that are likely to impact our current or future tax expense our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower effective tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher effective tax rates or by changes in tax laws or regulations in addition future acquisitions may affect the proportion of our pretax income from foreign jurisdictions both due to external sales and also increased volume in our selfowned supply chain at the same time a significant amount of the acquisition and integration costs such as legal fees bank fees and consulting fees associated with these acquisitions is generally incurred in the us which may decrease domestic taxable income we follow a disciplined acquisition strategy focused on acquisitions that meet strict criteria for strong likely returns with relatively low risk it is difficult to predict whether or when such acquisitions will occur and whether the acquisition targets will be foreign or domestic therefore it is also difficult to predict the effect of acquisitions on the future distribution of our pretax income we maintain intercompany transfer pricing agreements governing sales within our selfowned supply chain which can impact the amount of pretax income we recognize in foreign jurisdictions in compliance with applicable tax laws we regularly review the terms of these agreements utilizing independent thirdparty transfer pricing studies to ensure that intercompany pricing is consistent with what a seller would charge an independent arms length customer or what a buyer would pay an independent arms length supplier therefore changes in intercompany pricing are often driven by market conditions which are also difficult to predictwe regularly assess any significant exposure associated with increases in effective tax rates and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustment to our tax provisions see risk factors  we have a complex multinational tax structure and changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could impact our capital deployment strategy and adversely affect our results2016 highlightsnet sales in 2016 were 60 billion compared with 57 billion in 2015 representing a 5

liquidity is primarily driven by our strong cash flow provided by operating activities which is dependent on net income and changes in working capital as compared to prior year our operating cash increased in 2016 due to our increased profitability and changes in working capital specifically related to our inventory reduction efforts and a smaller voluntary pension contribution in 2016 of 40 million compared to 100 million in 2015investing activitiesthe higher net cash used for investing activities was primarily the result of our acquisitions of hanes australasia and champion europe partially offset by lower capital spending and increased cash proceeds from sale of assets in 2016 compared to 2015 which is primarily the result of cash receipts of 66 million towards an anticipated sale leaseback transaction of one of our manufacturing facilitiesfinancing activitiesthe higher net cash from financing activities was primarily the result of the issuance of our three senior notes in 2016 and incurrence of debt under our australia term loan facilities offset by lower net borrowing on our other credit facilities and higher share repurchases in 2016 financing arrangements we believe our financing structure provides a secure base to support our operations and key business strategies as of december 31 2016 we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit

period and currently believe that we have sufficient other sources of liquidity to support our assertion that such undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be considered to be reinvested permanentlywe repatriated 174 million 124 million and 15 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively from earnings generated in such years the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated in the past has been determined and the amount that we expect to repatriate during 2017 will be determined based upon a variety of factors including current year earnings of the foreign subsidiaries foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the us such as for the repayment of debt and other domestic obligations the majority of our repatriation of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries has historically occurred at yearend although we may always repatriate funds earlier in the year based on the needs of our business when we repatriate funds to the us we are required to pay taxes on these amounts based on applicable us tax rates net of any foreign tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against us income tax there was a cost of 56 million 43 million and 1 million in additional us federal income taxes in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in such years critical accounting policies and estimateswe have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies to our financial statementsthe application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures these estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors are described belowsales recognition and incentiveswe recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement ii the sales price is fixed or determinable iii title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured which occurs primarily upon shipment we record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and current customer information our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experiencenote summary of significant accounting policies d summary of significant accounting policies  sales recognition and incentives to our financial statements describes a variety of sales incentives that we offer to resellers and consumers of our products measuring the cost of these incentives requires in many cases estimating future customer utilization and redemption rates we use historical data for similar transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive programs our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience and other available information we classify the costs associated with cooperative advertising as a reduction of net sales in our consolidated statements of incomeaccounts receivable valuationaccounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers we carry our accounts receivable at their net realizable value in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the selling general and administrative expenses line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are primarily reflected as a reduction in the net sales line of our consolidated statements of income our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a large reserve might be required the amount of actual historical losses has not varied materially from our estimates for bad debts42table of contentsinventory valuationwe carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout or fifo method for our inventories we carry obsolete damaged and excess inventory at the net realizable value which we determine by assessing historical recovery rates current market conditions and our future marketing and sales plans because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time there are inherent uncertainties related to our value determination market factors and other conditions underlying the net realizable value may change resulting in further reserve requirements a reduction in the carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be reversed at a later period while we believe that adequate writedowns for inventory obsolescence have been provided in the financial statements consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory writedowns in the futurerebates discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is soldincome taxesdeferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of our assets and liabilities as well as for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies if in our judgment it appears that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets which increase income tax expense in the period when such determination is madewe have not provided federal income taxes on that portion of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings that is permanently reinvested in their respective foreign jurisdictions if we decided to remit those earnings to the us in a future period due to anticipated cash flow or other business requirements our federal income tax provision and effective tax rate could be impactedwe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution these assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits expiration of statutes of limitations

determined assumed results for that year are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in comprehensive income we measure the funded status of our plans as of the date of our fiscal year endthe net periodic cost of the pension plans is determined using projections and actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the longterm rate of asset return the net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in the year incurred gains and losses which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions are amortized over the average future expected life of participants as benefits under the hanesbrands inc pension plan are frozen year over 43table of contentsyear fluctuations in our pension expense are not expected to be material and not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as followsin determining the discount rate we utilized the aon hewitt aa above median curve rounded to the nearest 10 basis points in order to determine a unique interest rate for each plan and match the expected cash flows for each plan beginning in 2016 we began utilizing specific spot rates along the full yield curve in our determination of discount rates for our us defined benefit plans in order to determine our interest rate and match to the relevant cash flows for the plans this change improves the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of interest costssalary increase assumptions were based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions the salary increase assumption only applies to the canadian plans certain hanes europe innerwear plans and portions of the hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans as benefits under these plans are not frozen the benefits under the hanesbrands inc pension plan were frozen as of december 31 2005in determining the longterm rate of return on plan assets we applied a proportionally weighted blend between assuming the historical longterm compound growth rate of the plan portfolio would predict the future returns of similar investments and the utilization of forwardlooking assumptionsretirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while standard actuarial tables were used to estimate mortality in 2016 the tables used as a basis for the mortality assumption were from the rp2014 table with scale mp2015the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans benefit obligations all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following  increase decrease in pensionexpense benefitobligation in

intangiblestrademarks license agreements customer and distributor relationships and computer software are our primary identifiable intangible assets we amortize identifiable intangibles with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and we do not amortize identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives we base the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors including the effects of demand competition expected changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows as of december 31 2016 the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was 13 billion of which we are amortizing a balance of 218 million we anticipate that our amortization expense for 2017 will be 26 millionwe evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate asset amortization described below under  depreciation and impairment of property plant and equipment we assess identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter and more often as triggering events occur in order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets we compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount fair values of intangible assets are primarily based on future cash flows projected to be generated from that asset we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which an identifiable intangible assets carrying value exceeds its fair value goodwillas of december 31 2016 we had 11 billion of goodwill we do not amortize goodwill but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur the timing of our annual goodwill impairment testing is the first day of the third fiscal quarter the estimated fair values significantly exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter and no impairment of goodwill was identified as a result of the testing conducted in 201644table of contentsin evaluating the recoverability of goodwill in 2016 we estimated the fair value of our reporting units we relied on a number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results business plans and present value techniques as discussed above under trademarks and other identifiable intangibles there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them and the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes knownassets and liabilities acquired in business combinationswe account for business combinations using the purchase method which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date we recognize the excess of an acquired business cost over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as goodwill we use a variety of information sources to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities we generally use third party appraisers to assist management in determination of the fair value and lives of property and identifiable intangibles consulting actuaries to assist management in determining the fair value of obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans and legal counsel to assist management in assessing obligations associated with legal and environmental claimsdepreciation and impairment of property plant and equipmentwe state property plant and equipment at its historical cost and we compute depreciation using the straightline method over the assets life we estimate an assets life based on historical experience manufacturers estimates engineering or appraisal evaluations our future business plans and the period over which the asset will economically benefit us which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life our policies require that we periodically review our assets remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization a change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periodswe test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable such events include significant adverse changes in business climate several periods of operating or cash flow losses forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life we evaluate an assets recoverability by comparing the asset or asset groups net carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset or asset group will generate if we determine that an asset is not recoverable we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair valuewhen we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use we depreciate the assets adjusted carrying amount over its remaining useful life we do not restore previously recognized impairment losses if circumstances changerecently issued accounting

the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination when a business combination is completed the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are assigned to the reporting unit or units of the company given responsibility for managing controlling and generating returns on these assets and liabilities in many instances all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities are assigned to a single reporting unit and in these cases all of the goodwill is assigned to the same reporting unit in those situations in which the acquired assets and liabilities are allocated to more than one reporting unit the goodwill to be assigned to each reporting unit is determined in a manner similar to how the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determinedgoodwill is not amortized however it is assessed for impairment at least annually and as triggering events occur the companys annual measurement date is the first day of the third fiscal quarter in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units and compares it to the carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the next step of the process involves comparing the implied fair value to the carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit if the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the implied

being hedged these financial instruments are either designated as cash flow hedges or are economic hedges against changes in the value of the hedged item and therefore not designated as hedges for accounting purposes the company does not use derivatives for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivative contractson the date the derivative is entered into the company determines whether the derivative meets the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting treatment or whether the financial instrument is serving as an economic hedge against changes in the value of the hedged item and therefore is not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes the accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationshipthe company formally documents its hedge relationships including identifying the hedging instruments and the hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction this process includes linking derivatives that are designated as hedges of specific assets liabilities firm commitments or forecasted transactions the company also formally assesses both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item if it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge or if the anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur the company discontinues hedge accounting and any deferred gains or losses are recorded in the selling general and administrative expenses line of the consolidated statements of incomederivatives are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and classified as current or noncurrent based on the derivatives maturity dates the fair value is based upon either market quotes for actively traded instruments or independent bids for nonexchange traded instruments cash flows hedges are classified in the same category as the item being hedged and cash flows from derivative contracts not designated as hedges are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flowsthe company may be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by

obligations for the pension plans in determining the discount rate in the prior years the company utilized as a general benchmark the single discount rate equivalent to discount the expected cash flows from each plan using the yields at each duration from a published yield curve as of the measurement date beginning in 2016 the company changed the method utilized to estimate primarily the interest cost component of net periodic benefit costs for the companys us defined benefit plans from using a single discount rate as discussed above the company elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the interest component of benefit costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligations to the relevant projected cash flows the company made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of interest costs this change will not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in interest costs is completely offset by the actuarial gain or loss reported the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets was based on the companys investment policy target allocation of the asset portfolio between various asset classes and the expected real returns of each asset class over various periods of time the weighted average actuarial assumptions used in measuring the net periodic benefit cost and plan obligations for the periods presented were as follows  december

losses and to reduce the likelihood of excessive volatility of returns diversification of assets is achieved through strategic allocations to various asset classes as well as various investment styles within these asset classes and by retaining multiple third party investment management firms with complementary investment styles and philosophies to implement these allocations the company has
