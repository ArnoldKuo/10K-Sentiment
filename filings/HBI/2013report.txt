and distribution  during 2012 approximately 75 of our cost of sales were from finished goods manufactured through a combination of facilities we own and operate and facilities owned and operated by third party contractors who perform some of the steps in the manufacturing process for us such as cutting andor sewing we sourced the remainder of our finished goods from third party manufacturers who supply us with finished products based on our designs in making decisions about the location of manufacturing operations and third party sources of supply we consider a number of factors including labor local operating costs quality regional infrastructure applicable quotas and duties and freight costs we believe that our balanced approach to product supply which relies on a combination of owned contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions increases the efficiency of our operations reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply  finished goods that are manufactured by hanesbrands  the manufacturing process for the finished goods that we manufacture begins with raw materials we obtain from suppliers the principal raw materials in our product categories are cotton and synthetics cotton and synthetic materials are typically spun into yarn which is then knitted into cotton synthetic and blended fabrics we source all of our yarn requirements from largescale suppliers to a lesser extent we purchase fabric from several domestic and international suppliers in conjunction with scheduled production in addition to cotton yarn and cottonbased textiles we use thread narrow elastic and trim for product identification buttons zippers snaps and lace these fabrics are cut and sewn into finished products either by us or by third party contractors we currently operate 41 manufacturing facilities most of our cutting and sewing operations are strategically located in asia central america and the caribbean basin alternate sources of these materials and services are readily available  finished goods that are manufactured by third parties  in addition to our manufacturing capabilities we also source finished goods we design from third party manufacturers also referred to as turnkey products many of these turnkey products are sourced from international suppliers by our strategic sourcing hubs in asia  all contracted and sourced manufacturing must meet our high quality standards further all contractors and third party manufacturers must be preaudited and adhere to our strict supplier and business practices guidelines these requirements provide strict standards covering hours of work age of workers health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws and hanesbrands standards each new supplier must be inspected and agree to comprehensive compliance terms prior to performance of any production on our behalf we audit compliance with these standards and maintain strict compliance performance records in addition to our audit procedures we require certain of our suppliers to be worldwide responsible accredited production or wrap certified wrap is a recognized apparel certification program that independently monitors and certifies compliance with certain specified manufacturing standards that are intended to ensure that a given factory produces sewn goods under lawful humane and ethical conditions wrap uses third party independent certification firms and requires factorybyfactory certification    7    table of contents distribution  as of december 29 2012 we

manufacture our products we internally manage and operate 18 of these facilities and we use third party logistics providers who operate the other 13 facilities on our behalf international distribution operations use a combination of third party logistics providers as well as owned and operated distribution operations to distribute goods to our various international markets  inventory  effective inventory management is a key component of our future success because our customers generally do not purchase our products under longterm supply contracts but rather on a purchase order basis

employ various types of inventory management techniques that include collaborative forecasting and planning suppliermanaged inventory key event management and various forms of replenishment management processes our suppliermanaged inventory initiative is intended to shift raw material ownership and management to our suppliers until consumption freeing up cash and improving response time we have

additionally within our supply chain organization we have dedicated professionals who translate the demand forecast into our inventory strategy and specific production plans these individuals work closely with our customer management team to balance inventory investmentexposure with customer service targets  seasonality and other factors  our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors for instance we generally have higher sales during the backtoschool and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather which benefits certain product categories such as fleece our diverse range of product offerings however provides some mitigation to the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us media advertising and promotion expenses map may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns

employees were also covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe our relationships with our employees are good      item 1a risk factors  this section describes circumstances or events that could have a negative effect on our financial results or operations or that could change for the worse existing trends in our businesses the occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or on the trading prices of our common stock the risks and uncertainties described in this annual report on form 10k are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties that currently are not known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may adversely affect our businesses and operations  economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers suppliers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers discretionary spending is affected by many factors that are outside of our control including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation energy prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending reduced sales at our wholesale customers may lead to lower retail inventory levels reduced orders to hanesbrands or order cancellations these lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets may result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this may result in higher credit risk relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our suppliers of raw materials and finished goods logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and derivatives transactions in addition the inability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on which we rely for raw materials finished goods or services are unable to overcome financial difficulties and provide us with the materials and services we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities or derivatives transactions do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected    13    table of contents significant fluctuations and volatility in the price of various input costs such as cotton and oilrelated materials utilities freight and wages may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  the economic environment in which we are operating continues to be uncertain and volatile which could have unanticipated adverse effects on our business during 2013 and beyond we experienced a sustained increase in various input costs such as cotton and oilrelated materials utilities freight and wages during 2011 and the first half of 2012 and we may experience similar increases in the future inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins for example the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process such as oilrelated commodity prices and other raw materials such as dyes and chemicals and other costs such as fuel energy and utility costs can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors similarly a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the value of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs increases in inflation may not be matched by rises in income which also could have a negative impact on spending in addition sudden decreases in the costs for materials including cotton may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production which could result in lower profitability particularly if these decreases result in downward price pressure if in the future we incur volatility in the costs for materials including cotton and labor that we are unable to offset through price adjustments or improved efficiencies or if consumer spending declines or if our competitors unwillingness to follow our price changes results in downward price pressure our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected  we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market and our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively in the future  the basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price product quality selection service and purchasing convenience our businesses face competition today from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers as well as department stores and other retailers including many of our customers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands in our outerwear segment we also face competition in the branded printwear category from other manufacturers with respect to the sale of lowermargin products to wholesalers and third party embellishers whose purchasing decisions are primarily driven by price rather than brand name recognition increased competition may result in a loss of or a reduction in shelf space and promotional support and reduced prices in each case decreasing our cash flows operating margins and profitability our ability to remain competitive in the areas of price quality brand recognition research and product development manufacturing and distribution will in large part determine our future success if we fail to compete successfully our market share results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected  we rely on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales and the loss of or material reduction in sales to any of our top customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  in 2012 our top 10 customers accounted for 63 of our net sales and our top two customers walmart and target accounted for 28 and 18 of our net sales respectively we expect that these customers will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales in the future moreover our top customers are the largest market participants in our primary distribution channels across all of our product lines we generally do not enter into purchase agreements that obligate our customers to purchase our products and as a result most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis a decision by any of hanesbrands top customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from hanesbrands could substantially reduce revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition if any of our customers devote less selling space to apparel products our sales to those customers could be reduced even if we maintain our share of their apparel business any such reduction in apparel selling space could result in lower sales and our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected    14    table of contents any disruption to our supply chain or adverse impact on its extensive network of operations may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  we have an extensive global supply chain a significant portion of our products are manufactured in or sourced from locations in asia central america and the caribbean basin potential events that may disrupt our supply chain operations include            political instability and acts of war or terrorism or other international events resulting in the disruption of trade            other security risks            operational disruptions            disruptions in shipping and freight forwarding services            increases in oil prices which would increase the cost of shipping            interruptions in the availability of basic services and infrastructure including power shortages            fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulting in uncertainty as to future asset and liability values cost of goods and results of operations that are denominated in foreign currencies            extraordinary weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis floods or fires and            the occurrence of an epidemic the spread of which may impact our ability to obtain products on a timely basis  disruptions in our supply chain could negatively impact our business by interrupting production increasing our cost of sales disrupting merchandise deliveries delaying receipt of products into the united states or preventing us from sourcing our products at all depending on timing these events could also result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns all of the foregoing can have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  the loss of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw materials may interrupt our supplies and materially harm our business  we purchase all of the raw materials used in our products and approximately 25 of the cost of sales derived from apparel designed by us from a limited number of third party suppliers and manufacturers our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of raw materials and finished products from our third party suppliers and manufacturers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of our principal third party suppliers or manufacturers experience financial difficulties that they are not able to overcome resulting from worldwide economic conditions production problems difficulties in sourcing raw materials lack of capacity or transportation disruptions or if for these or other reasons they raise the prices of the raw materials or finished products we purchase from them the magnitude of this risk depends upon the timing of any interruptions the materials or products that the third party manufacturers provide and the volume of production  our dependence on third parties for raw materials and finished products subjects us to the risk of supplier failure and customer dissatisfaction with the quality of our products quality failures by our third party manufacturers or changes in their financial or business condition that affect their production could disrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers and thereby materially harm our business    15    table of contents if we fail to manage our inventory effectively we may be required to establish additional inventory reserves or we may not carry enough inventory to meet customer demands causing us to suffer lower margins or losses  we are faced with the constant challenge of balancing our inventory with our ability to meet marketplace needs inventory reserves can result from the complexity of our supply chain a long manufacturing process and the seasonal nature of certain products increases in inventory levels may also be needed to service our business as we continue to optimize our supply chain to further enhance efficiency improve working capital and asset turns and reduce costs as a result we could be subject to high levels of obsolescence and excess stock based on discussions with our customers and internally generated projections we produce purchase andor store raw material and finished goods inventory to meet our expected demand for delivery however we sell a large number of our products to a small number of customers and these customers generally are not required by contract to purchase our goods if after producing and storing inventory in anticipation of deliveries demand is lower than expected we may have to hold inventory for extended periods or sell excess inventory at reduced prices in some cases below our cost additionally sudden decreases in the costs for materials including cotton may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production if this occurs it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flow particularly if we hold a large amount of excess inventory excess inventory charges can reduce gross margins or result in operating losses lowered plant and equipment utilization and lowered fixed operating cost absorption all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows  conversely we also are exposed to lost business opportunities if we underestimate market demand and produce too little inventory for any particular period because sales of our products are generally not made under contract if we do not carry enough inventory to satisfy our customers demands for our products within an acceptable time frame they may seek to fulfill their demands from one or several of our competitors and may reduce the amount of business they do with us any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  we may not be able to achieve the benefits we are seeking through optimizing our supply chain which could impair our ability to further enhance efficiency improve working capital and asset turns and reduce costs  we have restructured our supply chain to create more efficient production clusters that utilize fewer larger facilities and to balance our production capability between the western hemisphere and asia we consolidated our distribution network by implementing new warehouse management systems and technology and adding new distribution centers and new third party logistics providers to replace parts of our legacy distribution network with our global supply chain infrastructure in place we continue to be focused longterm on optimizing our supply chain to further enhance efficiency improve working capital and asset turns and reduce costs through several initiatives such as suppliermanaged inventory for raw materials and sourced goods ownership arrangements if we are not able to optimize our supply chain we may not be successful at improving working capital and asset turns and reducing costs  our business could be harmed if we are unable to deliver our products to the market due to problems with our distribution network  we distribute our products from facilities that we operate as well as facilities that are operated by third party logistics providers because substantially all of our products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations our operations could be interrupted by extraordinary weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis floods or fires near our distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions to our distribution network in addition our distribution network is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from our distribution facilities if we are unable to successfully operate our distribution network our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected    16    table of contents due to the extensive nature of our foreign operations fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations  we sell a majority of our products in transactions denominated in us dollars however we purchase many of our raw materials pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies as a result when the us dollar weakens against any of these currencies our cost of sales could increase substantially outside the united states we may pay for materials or finished products in us dollars and in some cases a strengthening of the us dollar could effectively increase our costs where we use foreign currency to purchase the us dollars we need to make such payments we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates we are also exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our financial statements due to the translation of operating results and financial position of our foreign subsidiaries  our existing customers may require products on an exclusive basis forms of economic support and other changes that could be harmful to our business  customers increasingly may require us to provide them with some of our products on an exclusive basis which could cause an increase in the number of stock keeping units or skus we must carry and consequently increase our inventory levels and working capital requirements moreover our customers may increasingly seek markdown allowances incentives and other forms of economic support which reduce our gross margins and affect our profitability our financial performance is negatively affected by these pricing pressures when we are forced to reduce our prices without being able to correspondingly reduce our production costs  sales of and demand for our products may decrease if we fail to keep pace with evolving consumer preferences and trends which could have an adverse effect on net sales and profitability  our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to evolving consumer preferences and trends and to translate these preferences and trends into marketable product offerings if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or misjudge the market for our products our sales may be lower than expected and we may be faced with a significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions provide markdown allowances to our customers or liquidate excess merchandise any of which could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability our brand image may also suffer if customers believe that we are no longer able to offer innovative products respond to consumer preferences or maintain the quality of our products  any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure with respect to our information technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business  our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of our business moreover we and our customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in our systems it could also require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure problem or breach  the success of our business is tied to the strength and reputation of our brands including brands that we license to other parties if other parties take actions that weaken harm the reputation of or cause confusion with our brands our business and consequently our sales results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected  we license some of our important trademarks to third parties for example we license champion to third parties for athleticoriented accessories although we make concerted efforts to protect our brands through    17    table of contents  quality control mechanisms and contractual obligations imposed on our licensees there is a risk that some licensees may not be in full compliance with those mechanisms and obligations in that event or if a licensee engages in behavior with respect to the licensed marks that would cause us reputational harm we could experience a significant downturn in that brands business adversely affecting our sales and results of operations similarly any misuse of the wonderbra or playtex brands by sun capital could result in negative publicity and a loss of sales for our products under these brands any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows  we design manufacture source and sell products under trademarks that are licensed from third parties if any licensor takes actions related to their trademarks that would cause their brands or our company reputational harm our business may be adversely affected  we design manufacture source and sell a number of our products under trademarks that are licensed from third parties such as our polo ralph lauren mens underwear because we do not control the brands licensed to us our licensors could make changes to their brands or business models that could result in a significant downturn in a brands business adversely affecting our sales and results of operations if any licensor engages in behavior with respect to the licensed marks that would cause us reputational harm or if any of the brands licensed to us violates the trademark rights of another or are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable we could experience a significant downturn in that brands business adversely affecting our sales and results of operations and we may be required to expend significant amounts on public relations advertising and possibly legal fees  we are prohibited from selling our wonderbra and playtex intimate apparel products in the eu as well as certain other countries in europe and south africa and therefore are unable to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise in such countries  sun capital has an exclusive perpetual royaltyfree license to manufacture sell and distribute apparel products under the wonderbra and playtex trademarks in the member states of the eu as well as russia south africa switzerland and certain other nations in europe due to the exclusive license we are not permitted to sell wonderbra and playtex branded products in these nations and sun capital is not permitted to sell wonderbra and playtex branded products outside of these nations consequently we will not be able to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise relating to the sale of wonderbra and playtex products in these nations for more information on these sales restrictions see business  intellectual property  if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our business may be adversely affected  our trademarks and copyrights are important to our marketing efforts and have substantial value we aggressively protect these trademarks and copyrights from infringement and dilution through appropriate measures including court actions and administrative proceedings we are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing our intellectual property rights infringement or counterfeiting of our products could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect our business actions we have taken to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the united states or other countries such as changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on our ability to enforce those rights  the value of our intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks we are from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some items of our intellectual property    18    table of contents we are subject to certain risks as a result of our indebtedness  our indebtedness includes the 600 million revolving credit facility the revolving loan facility under our senior secured credit facility the senior secured credit facility our 250 million 8000 senior notes due 2016 the 8 senior notes our 1 billion 6375 senior notes due 2020 the 6375 senior notes and the 225 million accounts receivable securitization facility the accounts receivable securitization facility  the senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the 8 senior notes and the 6375 senior notes contain restrictions that affect and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit among other things our ability to borrow funds pay dividends or make other distributions make investments engage in transactions with affiliates or create liens on our assets covenants in the senior secured credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total debt to ebitda earnings before income taxes depreciation expense and amortization or leverage ratio and an additional covenant in the senior secured credit facility requires us to maintain a maximum total senior secured debt to ebitda ratio these restrictions and covenants could limit our ability to obtain additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions meet our debt payment obligations and capital commitments fund any operating losses or future development of our business affiliates obtain lower borrowing costs that are available from secured lenders or engage in advantageous transactions that monetize our assets or conduct other necessary or prudent corporate activities any failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default that accelerates the maturity of our indebtedness under such facilities resulting in an adverse effect on our business  the lenders under the senior secured credit facility have received a pledge of substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries with certain customary or agreedupon exceptions for foreign subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries additionally these lenders generally have a lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries with certain exceptions the financial institutions that are party to the accounts receivable securitization facility have a lien on certain of our domestic accounts receivables as a result of these pledges and liens if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the senior secured credit facility or the accounts receivable securitization facility the lenders under those facilities will be entitled to foreclose on substantially all of our assets and at their option liquidate these assets which would adversely impact the operations of our business  our indebtedness also could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have lower levels of debt these competitors could have greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions secure additional financing for their operations by incurring additional debt expend capital to expand their manufacturing and production operations to lowercost areas and apply pricing pressure on us in addition because many of our customers rely on us to fulfill a substantial portion of their basic apparel demand any concern these customers may have regarding our financial condition may cause them to reduce the amount of products they purchase from us our debt service obligations could also impede our ability to withstand downturns in our industry or the economy  market returns could have a negative impact on the return on plan assets for our pension which may require significant funding  the plan assets of our pension plans which had a return of approximately 11 and negative 1 during 2012 and 2011 respectively are invested mainly in domestic and international equities bonds and real estate we are unable to predict the variations in asset values or the severity or duration of any disruptions in the financial markets or adverse economic conditions in the united states europe and asia the funded status of these plans and the related cost reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty particularly in the current economic environment under the pension protection act of 2006 the pension protection act losses of asset values may necessitate increased funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements under the pension protection act    19    table of contents  funding rules our us qualified pension plan is approximately 84 funded as of december 29 2012 any downward pressure on the asset values of these plans may require us to fund obligations earlier than we had originally planned which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operations  our balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as a noncash expense in our consolidated statement of income  goodwill trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually the fair value of the goodwill assigned to a business unit could decline if projected revenues or cash flows were to be lower in the future due to effects of the global economy or other causes if the carrying value of intangible assets or of goodwill were to exceed its fair value the asset would be written down to its fair value with the impairment loss recognized as a noncash charge in the consolidated statement of income  as of december 29 2012 we had approximately 433 million of goodwill and 120 million of trademarks and other identifiable intangibles on our balance sheet which together represent 15 of our total assets in the second quarter of 2012 in connection with our imagewear restructuring we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 37 million related to our outer banks trademark and goodwill balances no other impairment was identified in 2012 and we have not had any impairment charges in the last two years prior to 2012 changes in the future outlook of a business unit could result in an impairment loss which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could increase our income taxes and decrease our net income  we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the amount of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the united states changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in tax laws adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns and other factors in order to service our debt obligations we may need to increase the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the united states which may significantly increase our income tax expense additionally our strategic initiative to enhance our global supply chain by optimizing lowercost manufacturing capacity and to support our commercial operations outside the united states may result in capital investments outside the united states that impact our income tax expense  our balance sheet includes a significant amount of deferred tax assets we must generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax benefits  as of december 29 2012 we had approximately 563 million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet which represents 16 of our total assets deferred tax assets relate to temporary differences differences between the assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the assets and liabilities in the calculation of taxable income the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax benefits will not be realized if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets which would cause an increase in our effective tax rate a significant increase in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  compliance with environmental and other regulations could require significant expenditures  we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that govern our activities operations and products that may have adverse environmental health and safety effects including laws and    20    table of contents  regulations relating to generating emissions water discharges waste product and packaging content and workplace safety noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in substantial monetary penalties and criminal sanctions future events that could give rise to manufacturing interruptions or environmental remediation include changes in existing laws and regulations the enactment of new laws and regulations a release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or any associated offsite disposal location or the discovery of contamination from current or prior activities at any of our properties while we are not aware of any proposed regulations or remedial obligations that could trigger significant costs or capital expenditures in order to comply any such regulations or obligations could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  our operations in international markets and our earnings in those markets may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks  during 2012 net sales from our international segment were 501 million representing approximately 11 of total net sales in addition a significant amount of our manufacturing and production operations are located or our products are sourced from outside the united states as a result our business is subject to risks associated with international operations these risks include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and the imposition of new tariffs quotas taxes or exchange controls  regulatory changes could limit the countries in which we sell produce or source our products or significantly increase the cost of operating in or obtaining materials originating from certain countries restrictions imposed by such changes can have a particular impact on our business when after we have moved our operations to a particular location new unfavorable regulations are enacted in that area or favorable regulations currently in effect are changed  countries in which our products are manufactured or sold may from time to time impose additional new regulations or modify existing regulations including            additional duties taxes tariffs and other charges on imports including retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which may or may not be based on wto rules and which would increase the cost of products produced in such countries            limitations on the quantity of goods which may be imported into the united states from a particular country including the imposition of further safeguard mechanisms by the us government or governments in other jurisdictions limiting our ability to import goods from particular countries such as china            changes in the classification andor valuation of products that could result in higher duty rates than we have historically paid            modification of the trading status of certain countries            requirements as to where products andor inputs are manufactured or sourced            creation of export licensing requirements imposition of restrictions on export quantities or specification of minimum export pricing andor export prices or duties            creation of other restrictions on imports            limitations on foreign owned businesses or            government actions to cancel contracts redenominate the official currency renounce or default on obligations renegotiate terms unilaterally or expropriate assets  changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors including those listed above could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows    21    table of contents we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act in addition to the anticorruption laws of the foreign countries in which we operate although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business reputation and operating results  we had approximately 51500 employees worldwide as of december 29 2012 and our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our employees or changes to us or foreign employment regulations  we had approximately 51500 employees worldwide as of december 29 2012 this means we have a significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our employees including wage and hour laws and regulations fair labor standards minimum wage requirements overtime pay unemployment tax rates workers compensation rates citizenship requirements and payroll taxes which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs approximately 43900 of those employees were outside of the united states a significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have employees could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases all of which may cause us to incur additional costs expend resources responding to such increases and lower our margins  in addition approximately 30 of our employees in the united states are members of labor organizations or are covered by collective bargaining agreements if there were a significant increase in the number of our employees who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements we would become vulnerable to a strike work stoppage or other labor action by these employees that could have an adverse effect on our business  we may suffer negative publicity if we or our third party manufacturers violate labor laws or engage in practices that are viewed as unethical or illegal which could cause a loss of business  we cannot fully control the business and labor practices of our third party manufacturers the majority of whom are located in asia central america and the caribbean basin if one of our own manufacturing operations or one of our third party manufacturers violates or is accused of violating local or international labor laws or other applicable regulations or engages in labor or other practices that would be viewed in any market in which our products are sold as unethical we could suffer negative publicity which could tarnish our brands image or result in a loss of sales in addition if such negative publicity affected one of our customers it could result in a loss of business for us  our business depends on our senior management team and other key personnel  our success depends upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel some of whom have unique talents and experience and would be difficult to replace the loss or interruption of the services of a member of our senior management team or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business during the transitional period that would be required for a successor to assume the responsibilities of the position our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain key managers sales people and others we may not be able to attract or retain these employees which could adversely affect our business  businesses that we may acquire may fail to perform to expectations and we may be unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses with our existing business  from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisition opportunities to support and strengthen our business we may not be able to realize all or a substantial portion of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions that we may    22    table of contents  consummate newly acquired businesses may not achieve expected results of operations including expected levels of revenues and may require unanticipated costs and expenditures acquired businesses may also subject us to liabilities that we were unable to discover in the course of our due diligence and our rights to indemnification from the sellers of such businesses even if obtained may not be sufficient to offset the relevant liabilities in addition the integration of newly acquired businesses may be expensive and timeconsuming and may not be entirely successful integration of the acquired businesses may also place additional pressures on our systems of internal control over financial reporting if we are unable to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses or if acquired businesses fail to produce targeted results it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition  antitakeover provisions of our charter and bylaws as well as maryland law and our stockholder rights agreement may reduce the likelihood of any potential change of control or unsolicited acquisition proposal that you might consider favorable  our charter permits our board of directors without stockholder approval to amend the charter to

directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder  in addition we have adopted a stockholder rights agreement which provides that in the event of an acquisition of or tender offer for 15 of our outstanding common stock our stockholders other than the acquirer shall be granted rights to purchase our common stock at a certain price the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our common stock without the approval of our board of directors  these and other provisions of maryland law or our charter

period  overview  our company  we are a consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading apparel brands including hanes champion bali playtex just my size leggs barely there wonderbra gear for sports zorba sol y oro and rinbros we design manufacture source and sell a broad range of basic apparel such as tshirts bras panties mens underwear kids underwear casualwear activewear socks and hosiery according to npd our brands held either the number one or number two us market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete for the 12month period ended november 30 2012  discontinued operations  during the second quarter of 2012 we narrowed the focus of our worldwide imagewear business which led us to sell our european imagewear business and discontinue our privatelabel and outer banks domestic imagewear operations that served wholesalers that sell to the screenprint industry  the sale of our european imagewear business to smartwares bv for 15 million approximately 13 million net of fees and other transaction related costs in cash proceeds resulted in a pretax loss of approximately 33 million the sale of our european imagewear business is consistent with our strategic direction to narrow the focus of our worldwide imagewear business by restructuring to exit noncore segments and reduce risk  in connection with the discontinuation of our privatelabel and outer banks domestic imagewear operations we incurred pretax charges of approximately 63 million in 2012 substantially all noncash for the writedown of intangibles inventory markdowns and other related items  the execution of our new worldwide imagewear strategy allows us to focus our imagewear business now known as branded printwear on hanes and champion branded products in the united states with improved operating margins this restructuring is expected to result in a smaller more profitable and less volatile operation in the longer term our branded printwear operations will continue to operate and serve the branded domestic screenprint market with the results of these operations being reported in the outerwear segment    31    table of contents as a result of these actions the current year and prior year disclosures reflect these operations as discontinued operations  our segments  as a result of the reduced size of our sheer hosiery business and changing trends we decided in the first quarter of 2012 to change our external segment reporting to include hosiery operations within the innerwear segment hosiery had previously been reported as a separate segment prior year segment sales and operating profit results including other minor allocation changes have been revised to conform to the current year presentation as a result of these changes our operations are now managed and reported in the following reportable segments            innerwear sells basic branded products that are replenishment in nature under the product categories of intimate apparel mens underwear kids underwear and socks            outerwear sells basic branded products that are primarily seasonal in nature under the product categories of casualwear and activewear to both retailers and wholesalers as well as licensed logo apparel in collegiate bookstores and other channels            direct to consumer includes our valuebased outlet stores and internet operations which sell products from our portfolio of leading brands our internet operations are supported by its catalogs            international primarily relates to the asia latin america canada and australia geographic locations which sell products that span across the innerwear and outerwear reportable segments  outlook for 2013  for 2013 we expect net sales of approximately 460 billion operating profit of 500 million to 550 million and diluted earnings per share of 325 to 340 we expect a decline in branded printwear net sales of 40 million to 50 million with approximately half of that decline occurring in the first quarter reflecting the rationalization that started in mid2012  we intend to increase our overall media investment in 2013 by 30 million to 40 million of which more than twothirds will occur in the second half  through operating results and continued improvements in working capital we expect to generate approximately 400 million to 500 million of operating cash flows in 2013 which includes expected pension contributions of approximately 38 million we ended 2012 with 125 billion in bond debt in 2013 we expect the primary use of cash flows will be for the prepayment of the remaining 250 million of 8 senior notes  business and industry trends  inflation and changing prices  we experienced a sustained increase in various input costs such as cotton and oilrelated materials utilities freight and wages during 2011 and the first half of 2012 and we may experience similar increases in the future our results in 2012 were impacted by this cost inflation by approximately 225 million however with the recent decline in cotton prices the most significant contributor to our cost inflation is now behind us based on current market conditions we expect a reduction in input costs in 2013 primarily as a result of lower cotton costs  cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products while we have sold our yarn operations we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our largescale yarn suppliers and may result in the need to implement future price increases in order to maintain our margins decreases in cotton prices can lead to lower margins for inventory and products produced from cotton we have already purchased particularly if there is    32    table of contents  downward price pressure as a result of consumer demand competition or other factors price increases including those implemented in response to higher prices for cotton and other raw materials contributed favorably to net sales growth and positively affected margins in 2012  our costs for cotton yarn and cottonbased textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton which is affected by among other factors weather consumer demand speculation on the commodities market the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control we are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton under our agreements with these suppliers we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases when we elect to fix the cotton cost component under these agreements interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of yarn the yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is their responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton suppliers however our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices although the cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us has historically represented only approximately 6 of our cost of sales it rose to around 14 in 2012 primarily as a result of cost inflation costs incurred today for materials and labor including cotton typically do not impact our results until the inventory is sold approximately six to nine months later  inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins for example the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process such as oilrelated commodities and other raw materials such as dyes and chemicals and other costs such as fuel energy and utility costs can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold in addition a significant portion of our products are manufactured in countries other than the united states and declines in the value of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs increases in inflation may not be matched by rises in consumer income which also could have a negative impact on spending  other business and industry trends  the basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price product quality selection service and purchasing convenience the majority of our core styles continue from year to year with variations only in color fabric or design details some products however such as intimate apparel activewear and sheer hosiery do have more of an emphasis on style and innovation our businesses face competition from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers as well as smaller companies department stores specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands  our top 10 customers accounted for 63 of our net sales our largest customers in 2012 were walmart target and kohls which accounted for 28 18 and 6 of total sales respectively the increasing bargaining power of retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek greater concessions in their purchase of our products while also demanding exclusivity of some of our products to counteract these effects it has become increasingly important to leverage our national brands through investment in our largest and strongest brands as our customers strive to maximize their performance especially in todays challenging economic environment brands are important in our core categories to drive traffic and project the quality and value our customers demand  our key business strategies  our key business strategies are focused on optimizing our strong brands to drive modest sales growth domestically and internationally using our lowcost global supply chain and implementing cost savings initiatives to expand margins and delivering strong cash flow to create value    33    table of contents we seek to drive modest sales growth by consistently offering consumers brands they trust and products with unsurpassed value our brands have a strong heritage in the basic apparel industry according to npd our brands held either the number one or number two us market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete for the 12month period ended november 30 2012 internationally our commercial markets include mexico canada japan india brazil and china where a substantial amount of gross domestic product growth outside the united states will be concentrated over the next decade our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends is key to our success our design research and product development teams in partnership with our marketing teams drive our efforts to bring innovations to market we seek to leverage our insights into consumer demand in the basic apparel industry to develop new products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing addressing changing customer needs and industry trends we also support our key brands with targeted effective advertising and marketing campaigns  we seek to expand margins through optimizing our lowcost global supply chain and streamlining our operations to reduce costs we believe that we are able to leverage our significant scale of operations to provide us with greater manufacturing efficiencies purchasing power and product design marketing and customer management resources than our smaller competitors our global supply chain spans across both the western and eastern hemispheres and provides us with a balanced approach to product supply which relies on a combination of owned contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions increases the efficiency of our operations reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply our global supply chain enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres thereby diversifying our production risks our textile production plant in nanjing china along with our other textile facilities and arrangements with outside contractors enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres to support our production capacity we have generated significant cost savings margin expansion and contributions to cash flow and will continue to do so as we further optimize our size scale and production capability we generated efficiency savings from our supply chain optimization initiatives of approximately 40 million during 2012  we seek to effectively generate strong cash flow through optimizing our capital structure and managing working capital levels our strong cash flows have resulted in a flexible longterm capital structure that is able to deliver shareholder value in numerous ways including debt reduction and our ability to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions in addition we intend to continue to improve turns for inventory which will also contribute to strong cash flows in 2013  seasonality and other factors  our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors generally our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items we generally have higher sales during the backtoschool and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather which benefits certain product categories such as fleece sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us media advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions  although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers discretionary spending is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit taxation gasoline prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside our control consumers purchases of discretionary items including our products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of    34    table of contents  actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions these consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or to purchase lowerpriced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to time  changes in product sales mix can impact our gross profit as the percentage of our sales attributable to higher margin products such as intimate apparel and mens underwear and lower margin products such as casualwear and activewear fluctuate from time to time in addition sales attributable to higher and lower margin products within the same product category fluctuate from time to time our customers may change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us which makes trends in product sales mix difficult to predict however certain changes in product sales mix are seasonal in nature as sales of socks hosiery and fleece products generally have higher sales during the last two quarters july to december of each fiscal year as a result of cooler weather backtoschool shopping and holidays while other changes in product mix may be attributable to customers preferences and discretionary spending  2012 highlights            net sales in 2012 were 453 billion compared with 443 billion in 2011 representing a 2 increase            operating profit was 440 million in 2012 compared with 447 million in 2011 representing a 2 decrease as a

cash flows were 549 million in 2012 compared to 168 million in 2011            gross capital expenditures were 41 million in 2012 compared to 90 million in 2011 proceeds from sales of assets were less than 1 million in 2012 and 14 million in 2011            we have substantially completed our debt reduction plan by redeeming all of the floating rate senior notes of 293 million and 250 million of the 8 senior notes in 2012 we expect to redeem the remaining 250 million of 8 senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2013            we narrowed the focus of our worldwide imagewear business during the second quarter of 2012 which led us to sell our european imagewear business and discontinue our privatelabel and outer banks domestic imagewear operations that served wholesalers that sell to the

resulted from the following            stronger net sales of our mens underwear and kids underwear product categories primarily resulting from price increases and space gains partially offset by lower unit sales volume            higher net sales in activewear and casualwear product categories as a result of higher unit sales volume and space gains and price increases            lower net sales in our branded printwear category primarily due to lower unit sales volume especially in lightweight commodityoriented products            lower net sales in the international segment primarily due to an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates            slightly lower net sales in our intimate apparel and socks product categories primarily as a result of lower unit sales volume partially offset by price increases and space gains  gross profit  gross profit was 73 million lower in 2012 as compared to 2011 as a percentage of net sales our gross profit was 314 in 2012 compared to 337 in 2011 the lower gross profit was impacted by cost inflation primarily higher cotton costs and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency rates partially offset by price increases efficiency savings from our supply chain and lower excess and obsolete inventory costs  selling general and administrative expenses  our selling general and administrative expenses were 66 million lower in 2012 compared to 2011 the lower selling general and administrative expenses were primarily attributable to lower media advertising and promotion map expenses and lower distribution expenses partially offset by higher noncash pension and stock compensation expenses as a percentage of net sales our selling general and administrative expenses were 217 in 2012 compared to 236 in 2011    36    table of contents other highlights  interest expense  lower by 19 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances mainly resulting from the prepayment of our floating rate notes our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was 581 during 2012 compared to 563 in 2011  other expenses  we incurred charges of approximately 34 million in 2012 related to premiums and an acceleration of unamortized debt issue cost in connection with a 250 million prepayment of our 8 senior notes we also incurred 3 million in 2012 related to an acceleration of unamortized debt issue cost in connection with prepayments totaling 293 million of our floating rate notes  income tax expense  our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 116 in 2012 compared to 148 in 2011 the lower effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to an income tax benefit of approximately 10 million in 2012 related to the realization of unrecognized tax benefits resulting from expiration of statutes of limitations and an income tax benefit of approximately 4 million in 2012 related to an increase in research and development tax credits  in connection with the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 that was signed into law in january 2013 we expect to record a onetime benefit of approximately 6 million related to retroactive tax relief for certain tax provisions that expired in 2012 because the legislation was signed into law after the end of our 2012 fiscal year the retroactive effects of the bill will be reflected in the first quarter of 2013  discontinued operations  discontinued operations include the sale of our european imagewear business and the discontinuation of our privatelabel and outer banks domestic imagewear operations that served

settled following the finalization of tax reviews and audits for amounts that were less than originally anticipated this nonrecurring income tax benefit was partially offset by a higher proportion of

funding rules our us qualified pension plan is approximately 84 funded as of december 29 2012 compared to 73 funded as of december 31 2011 the increase in the funded status is primarily driven by a decrease in longterm pension liabilities as a result of recently passed pension funding relief in addition to an increase in the fair value of plan assets as a result of the markets performance during

operating activities  the higher net cash from operating activities is primarily attributable to improved working capital resulting from a reduction in inventory levels caused by declining cotton costs and unit levels    46    table of contents investing activities  the lower net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of lower net capital expenditures of 36 million and net cash proceeds of 13 million from the sale of the european imagewear business in 2012 in addition we used cash of 9 million in 2011 related to the acquisition of tnf in april 2011  financing activities  the higher net cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of redeeming 293 million of our floating rate senior notes and 250 million of our 8 senior notes in 2012 and lower net

we were in compliance with all financial covenants  floating rate senior notes  on december 14 2006 we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of the floating rate senior notes the net proceeds from the sale of the floating rate senior notes were approximately 492 million these proceeds together with working capital were used to repay an outstanding debt balance under another loan facility

facilities at december 29 2012    50    table of contents undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries  as of december 29 2012 the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries was approximately 16 billion of which 6 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested and less than 1 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are not considered permanently reinvested our intention is to reinvest the cash and cash equivalents of those entities whose undistributed earnings we have previously asserted as being permanently reinvested in our international operations we reassess our reinvestment assertions each reporting period and currently believe that we have sufficient other sources of liquidity to support our assertion that such undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be considered to be reinvested permanently  we repatriated 20 million 28 million and 21 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively from earnings generated in such years the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated in the past has been determined and the amount that we expect to repatriate during 2013 will be determined based upon a variety of factors including current year earnings of the foreign subsidiaries foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the us such as for the repayment of debt and other domestic obligations the majority of our repatriation of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries has historically occurred at yearend although we may always repatriate funds earlier in the year based on the needs of our business when we repatriate funds to the us we are required to pay taxes on these amounts based on applicable us tax rates net of any foreign tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against us income tax we paid 0 2 million and 2 million in additional us federal income taxes in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in such years we do not currently expect the amount of repatriated foreign earnings or the resulting additional tax expense in 2013 to differ materially from prior fiscal years  critical accounting policies and estimates  we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our financial statements  the application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures these estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors are described below  sales recognition and incentives  we recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement ii the sales price is fixed or determinable iii title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured which occurs primarily upon shipment we record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and current customer information our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience  note 2d summary of significant accounting policies  sales recognition and incentives to our financial statements describes a variety of sales incentives that we offer to resellers and consumers of our products measuring the cost of these incentives requires in many cases estimating future customer utilization    51    table of contents  and redemption rates we use historical data for similar transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive programs our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience and other available information we classify the costs associated with cooperative advertising as a reduction of net sales in our consolidated statements of income  accounts receivable valuation  accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers we carry our accounts receivable at their net realizable value in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the selling general and administrative expenses line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are primarily reflected as a reduction in the net sales line of our consolidated statements of income our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a large reserve might be required the amount of actual historical losses has not varied materially from our estimates for bad debts  inventory valuation  we carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout or fifo method for our inventories we carry obsolete damaged and excess inventory at the net realizable value which we determine by assessing historical recovery rates current market conditions and our future marketing and sales plans because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time there are inherent uncertainties related to our value determination market factors and other conditions underlying the net realizable value may change resulting in further reserve requirements a reduction in the carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be reversed at a later period while we believe that adequate writedowns for inventory obsolescence have been provided in the financial statements consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory writedowns in the future  rebates discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold  income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of our assets and liabilities as well as for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies if in our judgment it appears that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets which increase income tax expense in the period when such determination is made  we have not provided federal income taxes on that portion of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings that is permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions if we decided to remit those earnings to the united states in a future period due to anticipated cash flow or other business requirements our federal income tax provision and effective tax rate could be impacted    52    table of contents we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution these assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits expiration of statutes of limitations as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations income tax expense is adjusted in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which these events occur  stock compensation  we established the hanesbrands inc omnibus incentive plan of 2006 the omnibus incentive plan to award stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units deferred stock units performance shares and cash to our employees nonemployee directors and employees of our subsidiaries to promote the interest of our company and incent performance and retention of employees stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period estimation of stockbased compensation for stock options granted utilizing the blackscholes optionpricing model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility and expected option life we use a combination of the volatility of our company and the volatility of peer companies for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volatility assumptions we utilize the simplified method outlined in sec accounting rules to estimate expected lives for options granted the simplified method is used for valuing stock option grants by eligible public companies that do not have sufficient historical exercise patterns on options granted to employees we estimate forfeitures for stockbased awards granted that are not expected to vest if any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future  defined benefit pension plans  for a discussion of our net periodic benefit cost plan obligations plan

pension plan is approximately 84 funded as of december 29 2012 compared to 73 funded as of december 31 2011 the increase in the funded status is primarily driven by a decrease in longterm pension liabilities as a result of recently passed pension funding relief in addition to an increase in the fair value of plan assets as a result of the markets performance during 2012 in july 2012 the us

preliminary calculation by our actuary in addition to the required cash contributions we may elect to make voluntary contributions to maintain an 80 funded level which will avoid certain benefit payment restrictions under the pension protection act we expect pension expense in 2013 of approximately 15 million compared to 17 million in 2012 see note 15 defined benefit pension plans to our financial statements for more information on the plan asset components the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans are recognized on our balance sheet and changes in the funded status are reflected in comprehensive income we measure the funded status of our plans as of the date of our fiscal year end  the net periodic cost of the pension plans is determined using projections and actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the longterm rate of asset return the net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in the year incurred gains and losses which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions are amortized over the average future expected life of participants    53    table of contents our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as follows            in determining the discount rate we utilized the aon hewitt aa above median curve rounded to the nearest 10 basis points in order to determine a unique interest rate for each plan and match the expected cash flows for each plan this methodology represents a change from using the citigroup pension discount curve in prior years we consider the aon hewitt aa above median curve a more appropriate model to determine the discount rates for our plans            salary increase assumptions were based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions the salary increase assumption only applies to the canadian plans and portions of the hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans as benefits under these plans are not frozen the benefits under the hanesbrands inc pension plan were frozen as of december 31 2005            in determining the longterm rate of return on plan assets we applied a proportionally weighted blend between assuming the historical longterm compound growth rate of the plan portfolio would predict the future returns of similar investments and the utilization of forward looking assumptions            retirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while standard actuarial tables were used to estimate mortality  the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans benefit obligations all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following                    increase decrease in     in millions   pensionexpense     benefitobligation     1 decrease in discount rate           152     1 increase in discount rate            123     1 decrease in expected investment return     6       na     1 increase in expected investment return     6       na    trademarks and other identifiable intangibles  trademarks license agreements customer and distributor relationships and computer software are our primary identifiable intangible assets all of our identifiable intangibles have finite lives therefore we amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives we base the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors including the effects of demand competition expected changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows as of december 29 2012 the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was 120 million of which we are amortizing the entire balance we anticipate that our amortization expense for 2013 will be 13 million  we evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate asset amortization described below under  depreciation and impairment of property plant and equipment we assess identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur in order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization we compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which an identifiable intangible assets carrying value exceeds its fair value during 2012 we recognized a noncash impairment charge of 37 million related to our outer banks trademark and writeoff of goodwill in connection with the discontinuation of our outer banks domestic imagewear operations please see discontinued operations in this annual report on form 10k for more information  goodwill  as of december 29 2012 we had 433 million of goodwill we do not amortize goodwill but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur the timing of our annual goodwill    54    table of contents  impairment testing is the first day of the third fiscal quarter the estimated fair values significantly exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter and no impairment of goodwill was identified as a result of the testing conducted in 2012  in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill in 2012 we estimated the fair value of our reporting units we relied on a number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results business plans and present value techniques as discussed above under trademarks and other identifiable intangibles there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them and the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known  depreciation and impairment of property plant and equipment  we state property plant and equipment at its historical cost and we compute depreciation using the straightline method over the assets life we estimate an assets life based on historical experience manufacturers estimates engineering or appraisal evaluations our future business plans and the period over which the asset will economically benefit us which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life our policies require that we periodically review our assets remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization a change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periods  we test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable such events include significant adverse changes in business climate several periods of operating or cash flow losses forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life we evaluate an assets recoverability by comparing the asset or asset groups net carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset or asset group will generate if we determine that an asset is not recoverable we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  when we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use we depreciate the assets adjusted carrying amount over its remaining useful life we do not restore previously recognized impairment losses if circumstances change  recently issued accounting pronouncements  disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  in december 2011 the fasb issued new accounting rules related to new disclosure requirements regarding the nature of an entitys rights of setoff and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments the new rules are effective for us in the first quarter of 2014 with retrospective application required we do not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows  presentation of comprehensive income  in february 2013 the fasb issued a new rule related to the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income that requires entities to report either on their income statement or in a footnote to their financial statements the effects on earnings from items that are reclassified out of other comprehensive income the new accounting rules are effective for us in the first quarter of 2013 we do not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows    55    table of contents   item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices our risk management control system uses analytical techniques including market value sensitivity analysis and value at risk estimations  foreign exchange risk  we sell the majority of our products in transactions denominated in us dollars however we purchase some raw materials pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies our exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with respect to the canadian dollar mexican peso and japanese yen against the us dollar we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates a sensitivity analysis technique has been used to evaluate the effect that changes in the market value of foreign exchange currencies will have on our forward and option contracts at december 29 2012 the potential change in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in the underlying currency price was 7 million  interest rates  our debt under the revolving loan facility and accounts receivable securitization facility bears interest at variable rates as a result we are exposed to changes in market interest rates that could impact the cost of servicing our debt we are required under the senior secured credit facility to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt to reduce interest rate risk caused by floating rate debt issuance we are in compliance with this provision as a result of our 8 senior notes and 6375 senior notes which bear interest at fixed rates approximately 84 of our total debt outstanding at december 29 2012 is at a fixed rate given a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed rates a 25basis point movement in the annual interest rate charged on the outstanding debt balances as of december 29 2012 would only result in a change in annual interest expense of 1 million  commodities  cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products while we have sold our yarn operations we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our largescale yarn suppliers while decreases in cotton prices can result in inventory comprised of products made from highercost yarn and in our purchase of cotton at contractually fixed prices that are above the current market rate our costs for cotton yarn and cottonbased textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton which is affected by among other things weather consumer demand speculation on the commodities market the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control we are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton under our agreements with these suppliers we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases when we elect to fix the cotton cost component under these agreements interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of yarn the yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is their responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton suppliers however our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices although the cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us has historically represented only 6 of our cost of sales it has risen to around 14 primarily as a result of cost inflation costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold for example we estimate that an increase of 001 per pound in cotton prices at current levels of production would affect our annual cost of sales by 3 million related to finished goods manufactured internally in our manufacturing facilities and 1 million related to finished goods sourced by third parties the    56    table of contents  ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified as the effect of movements in cotton prices on industry selling prices are uncertain but any dramatic increase in the price of cotton could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally significant decreases in the price of cotton may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production which could result in lower gross margins particularly if these decreases result in downward price pressure  in addition fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices may influence the prices of other raw materials we use to manufacture our products such as chemicals dyestuffs polyester yarn and foam we generally purchase raw materials at market prices we estimate that a change of 1000 per barrel in the price of oil would affect our freight costs by approximately 5 million at current levels of usage      item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  our financial statements required by this

factors including historical utilization and redemption rates all cash incentives of this type are included in the determination of net sales the company includes incentives offered in the form of free products in the determination of cost of sales volumebased incentives  these incentives typically involve rebates or refunds of cash that are redeemable only if the reseller completes a specified number of sales transactions under these incentive programs the company estimates the anticipated rebate to be paid and allocates a portion of the estimated cost of the rebate to each underlying sales transaction with the customer the company includes these amounts in the determination of net sales cooperative advertising  under these arrangements the company agrees to reimburse the reseller for a

experience aging of trade receivables specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information  l inventory valuation  inventories are stated at the estimated lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout or fifo method for inventories obsolete damaged and excess inventory is carried at the net realizable value which is determined by assessing historical recovery rates current market conditions and future marketing and sales plans rebates discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold  m property  property is stated at historical cost and depreciation expense is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets machinery and equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from three to 15 years and buildings and building improvements over periods of up to 40 years a change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periods additions and improvements that substantially extend the useful life of a particular    f11    table of contents hanesbrands inc  notes to consolidated

construction period of major properties are capitalized repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred upon sale or disposition of an asset the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  property is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable such events include significant adverse changes in the business climate several periods of operating or cash flow losses forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life recoverability of property is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value when an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used the adjusted carrying amount of those assets is depreciated over its remaining useful life restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is not permitted under us generally accepted accounting principles  n trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets  the primary identifiable intangible assets of the company are trademarks license agreements customer and distributor relationships and computer software all of which have finite lives that are subject to amortization the estimated useful life of a finitelived intangible asset is based upon a number of factors including the effects of demand competition expected changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows trademarks are being amortized over periods ranging from six to 30 years license agreements are being amortized over periods ranging from six to 15 years customer and distributor relationships are being amortized over periods ranging from three to 10 years and computer software is being amortized over periods ranging from three to seven years identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating elements of property  the company capitalizes internal software development costs which include the actual costs to purchase software from vendors and generally include personnel and related costs for employees who were directly associated with the enhancement and implementation of purchased computer software additions to computer software are included in purchases of property plant and equipment in the consolidated statements of cash flows  o goodwill  goodwill is the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination when a business combination is completed the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are assigned to the reporting unit or units of the company given responsibility for managing controlling and generating returns on these assets and liabilities in many instances all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities are assigned to a single reporting unit and in these cases all of the goodwill is assigned to the same reporting unit in those situations in which the acquired assets and liabilities are allocated to more than one reporting unit the goodwill to be assigned to each reporting unit is determined in a manner similar to how the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined  goodwill is not amortized however it is assessed for impairment at least annually and as triggering events occur the companys annual measurement date is the first day of the third fiscal quarter in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill the company estimates the fair value of our reporting units and compares it to the carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the next step of the process involves comparing the implied fair value to the carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit if the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment    f12    table of contents hanesbrands inc  notes to

such excess no impairment of goodwill was identified as a result of the testing conducted in 2012 in estimating the fair values of the reporting units management relies on a number of factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results business plans and present value techniques rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment  p insurance reserves  the company is selfinsured for property workers compensation medical and other casualty programs up to certain stoploss limits undiscounted liabilities for selfinsured exposures are accrued at the present value of the expected aggregate losses below those limits and are based on a number of assumptions including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions  q stockbased compensation  the company established the hanesbrands inc omnibus incentive plan of 2006 the hanesbrands oip to award stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units deferred stock units performance shares and cash to its employees nonemployee directors and employees of its subsidiaries to promote the interests of the company and incent performance and retention of employees the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based upon the grant date fair value of those awards  r income taxes  deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse given continuing losses in certain jurisdictions in which the company operates on a separate return basis a valuation allowance has been established for the deferred tax assets in these specific locations the company periodically estimates the probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgment there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company transacts business the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of regulations income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which these events occur and these adjustments are included in the companys consolidated statements of income if such changes take place there is a risk that the companys effective tax rate may increase or decrease in any period a company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution  s financial instruments  the company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposures to movements in foreign exchange rates the use of these financial instruments modifies the companys exposure to these risks with the goal of reducing the risk or cost to the company depending on the nature of the underlying risk being hedged these financial instruments are either designated as cash flow hedges or are economic hedges against changes in the value of the hedged item and therefore not designated as hedges for accounting purposes the company does not use derivatives for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivative contracts    f13    table of contents hanesbrands inc  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  years ended december 29 2012 december 31 2011 and january 1 2011  amounts in thousands except per share data    on the date the derivative is entered into the company determines whether the derivative meets the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting treatment or whether the financial instrument is serving as an economic hedge against changes in the value of the hedged item and therefore is not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes the accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  the company formally documents its hedge relationships including identifying the hedging instruments and the hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction this process includes linking derivatives that are designated as hedges of specific assets liabilities firm commitments or forecasted transactions the company also formally assesses both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item if it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge or if the anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur the company discontinues hedge accounting and any deferred gains or losses are recorded in the selling general and administrative expenses line of the consolidated statements of income  derivatives are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and classified as current or noncurrent based on the derivatives maturity dates the fair value is based upon either market quotes for actively traded instruments or independent bids for nonexchange traded instruments cash flows hedges are classified in the same category as the item being hedged and cash flows from derivative contracts not designated as hedges are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows  the company may be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by individual counterparties or the entire group of counterparties to the companys derivative contracts risk of nonperformance by counterparties is mitigated by dealing with highly rated counterparties and by diversifying across counterparties  cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive loss line of the consolidated balance sheets when the hedged item affects the income statement the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss is reported on the same line in the consolidated statements of income as the hedged item in addition both the fair value of changes excluded from the companys effectiveness assessments and the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges are reported in the selling general and administrative expenses line in the consolidated statements of income  derivative contracts not designated as hedges  for derivative contracts not designated as hedges changes in fair value are reported in the selling general and administrative expenses line of the consolidated statements of income these contracts are recorded at fair value when the hedged item is recorded as an asset or liability and then are revalued each accounting period  t recently issued accounting pronouncements  fair value measurements  in may 2011 the fasb issued new accounting rules related to fair

provisions of the rules issued in june 2011 that required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net

accumulated other comprehensive income that requires entities to report either on their income statement or in a footnote to their financial statements the effects on earnings from items that are

price of each stock option equals the closing market price of hanesbrands stock on the date of grant options granted vest ratably over three years and can be exercised over a term of 10 years the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model there were no options granted during 2012 and 2011 the assumptions for the blackscholes optionpricing model used in determining the fair value of options granted during 2010 were as follows dividend risk yield of 0 risk free interest rate range of 164 to 190 volatility range of 50 to 54 and expected term range of 53 years to 60 years  the dividend yield assumption is based on the companys intent not to pay dividends as of the grant date the company used a combination of the volatility of the company and the volatility of peer companies for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volatility assumptions due to the limited trading history of the companys common stock as of the grant date the company utilized the simplified method outlined in sec accounting rules to estimate expected lives for options granted the simplified

orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability a threetier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value is utilized for disclosing the fair value of the companys assets and liabilities these tiers include level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted    f31    table of contents hanesbrands inc  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  years ended december 29 2012 december 31 2011 and january 1 2011

3 defined as unobservable inputs about which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions  assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of the following three valuation techniques            market approach  prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities            cost approach  amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost            income approach  techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on market expectations including present value techniques optionpricing and other models  the company primarily applies the market approach for commodity derivatives and for all defined benefit plan investment assets and the income approach for interest rate and foreign currency derivatives for recurring fair value measurements and attempts to utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the determination of fair values incorporates various factors that include not only the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements but also the impact of the companys nonperformance risk on its liabilities the companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels  as of december 29 2012 and december 31 2011 the company held certain financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis these consisted of the companys derivative instruments related to interest rates and foreign exchange rates and defined benefit pension plan investment assets the fair values of interest rate and foreign exchange rate derivatives are determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets and are categorized as level 2 the fair values of defined benefit pension plan investments include

positions had been effectively settled following the finalization of tax reviews and audits for amounts less than originally estimated  although it is not reasonably possible to estimate the amount by
