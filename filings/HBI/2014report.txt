stores incmanufacturing sourcing and distributionduring 2013 approximately 67 of our cost of sales were from finished goods manufactured through a combination of facilities we own and operate and facilities owned and operated by third party contractors who perform some of the steps in the manufacturing process for us such as cutting andor sewing we sourced the remainder of our finished goods from third party manufacturers who supply us with finished products based on our designs in making decisions about the location of manufacturing operations and third party sources of supply we consider a number of factors including labor local operating costs quality regional infrastructure applicable quotas and duties and freight costs we believe that our balanced approach to product supply which relies on a combination of owned contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions increases the efficiency of our operations reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supplyfinished goods that are manufactured by hanesbrandsthe manufacturing process for the finished goods that we manufacture begins with raw materials we obtain from suppliers the principal raw materials in our product categories are cotton and synthetics cotton and synthetic materials are typically spun into yarn which is then knitted into cotton synthetic and blended fabrics we source all of our yarn requirements from largescale suppliers to a lesser extent we purchase fabric from several domestic and international suppliers in conjunction with scheduled production in addition to cotton yarn and cottonbased textiles we use thread narrow elastic and trim for product identification buttons zippers snaps and lace these fabrics are cut and sewn into finished products either by us or by third party contractors we currently operate 39 manufacturing facilities most of our cutting and sewing operations are strategically located in asia central america and the caribbean basin alternate sources of these materials and services are readily available5table of contentsfinished goods that are manufactured by third partiesin addition to our manufacturing capabilities we also source finished goods we design from thirdparty manufacturers also referred to as turnkey products many of these turnkey products are sourced from international suppliers by our strategic sourcing hubs in asiaall contracted and sourced manufacturing must meet our high quality standards further all contractors and thirdparty manufacturers must be preaudited and adhere to our strict supplier and business practices guidelines these requirements provide strict standards that among other things cover hours of work age of workers health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws and hanesbrands standards each new supplier must be inspected and agree to comprehensive compliance terms prior to performance of any production on our behalf we audit compliance with these standards and maintain strict compliance performance records in addition to our audit procedures many of our suppliers are certified by the worldwide responsible accredited production or wrap program wrap uses thirdparty independent audit firms and requires factorybyfactory certification we are also a fully accredited participating company in the fair labor associationdistributionas of december 28 2013 we distributed our products from 37 distribution centers these facilities include 17 facilities located in the united states and 20 facilities located outside the united states in regions where we manufacture our products we internally manage and operate 20 of these facilities and we use third party logistics providers who operate the other 17 facilities on our behalf international distribution operations use a combination of third party logistics providers as well as owned and operated distribution operations to distribute goods to our various international marketsinventoryeffective inventory management is a key component of our future success because our customers generally do not purchase our products under longterm supply contracts but rather on a purchase order basis effective inventory management requires close coordination with the customer base we seek to ensure that products are available to meet customer demands while effectively managing inventory levels we employ various types of inventory management techniques that include collaborative forecasting and planning suppliermanaged inventory key event management and various forms of replenishment management processes our suppliermanaged inventory initiative is intended to shift raw material ownership and management to our suppliers until consumption freeing up cash and improving response time we have demand management planners in our customer management group who work closely with customers to develop demand forecasts that are passed to the supply chain we also have professionals within the customer management group who coordinate daily with our larger customers to help ensure that our customers planned inventory levels are in fact available at their individual retail outlets additionally within our supply chain organization we have dedicated professionals who translate the demand forecast into our inventory strategy and specific production plans these individuals work closely with our customer management team to balance inventory investmentexposure with customer service targetsseasonality and other factorsour operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors for instance we generally have higher sales during the backtoschool and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather which benefits certain product categories such as fleece our diverse range of product offerings however provides some mitigation to the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us media advertising and promotion expenses map may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductionsproduct innovation and marketinga significant component of our marginenhancing innovatetoelevate strategy is our strong product research and development and innovation capabilities from 2011 to 2013 we spent over 145 million on design research and product development including the development of new and improved products6table of contentswe use a disciplined consumerdriven approach to direct our product innovation and marketing efforts we seek to identify relevant consumer insights and longterm megatrends that will impact our product categories over the next five to 10 years we focus our innovation efforts on bigidea platforms that span brands product categories business segments distribution channels and geographies in addition we concentrate on margin accretive product innovations where we can leverage our supply chain in order to drive further economies of scale examples of our product innovation platforms includetagless over a decade ago we launched hanes tagless tees that deliver superior softness without the itch and irritation of a tag in 2012 our consumerdriven innovation process led us to expand this platform to the male underwear bottom category where research indicated that itchy tags were the number two consumer complaint the tagless platform also taps into the power of our supply chain generating significant cost savings and allowing us to expand gross marginscomfortblend comfortblend our fabric innovation that combines cotton and synthetic yarns for products that are softer shrink less and dry faster is an outgrowth of the performance fabric megatrend in developing comfortblend we worked through each step of the big idea process testing the concept the product and the advertising we introduced hanes mens comfortblend underwear in 2012 with exceptional results and are now expanding this platform to socks childrens underwear and pantiessmart sizes our smart sizes platform is another example of our consumerdriven innovation process where research indicated the two most significant consumer complaints in the bra category were that the consumer could not find the right size and that the consumer could not find a comfortable bra smart sizes effectively addresses both concerns by combining a simplified shopping system that eliminates the complicated cupandband combinations of traditional bra sizing systems with a more comfortable flexible fit we have successfully leveraged the smart sizes platform across our hanes playtex bali jmsjust my size and barely there brands where it is beginning to drive incremental purchases in a category where consumers typically buy only a little over three bras per yearxtemp xtemp is our newest platform and brings a new level of technology and comfort to basic apparel hanes xtemp garments are designed to keep consumers cooler and drier by increasing the rate of evaporation when body temperature rises and reducing the rate of evaporation as body temperature colls the xtemp platform was successfully introduced in hanes mens underwear and mens socks in 2013 and will be available in womens socks and panties in spring 2014 as well as bras legwear base layer and childrens underwear and socks later in the year driving innovation platforms across categories is a major element of our innovatetoelevate strategy as it enables us to meet key consumer needs and leverage advertising dollars we believe that the strength of our consumer insights our distinctive brand propositions and our focus on integrated marketing give us a competitive advantage in the fragmented apparel marketplace effectively marketing these innovations also accrues benefits back to our supply chain driving higher volume helps us to leverage scale and drive costs down even further increasing margins while funding additional marketing support for our brands and products so we can continue to reinvest in product innovationin 2013 we increased our media spending by approximately 35 million over prior year we supported our hanes mens tagless and comfortblend innovations with

comfortblend undershirts and underwear we also introduced new national campaigns supporting hanes panties and playtex brascompetitionthe basic apparel market is highly competitive and rapidly evolving

collective bargaining agreements we believe our relationships with our employees are good item 1arisk factorsthis section describes circumstances or events that could have a negative effect on our financial results or operations or that could change for the worse existing trends in our businesses the occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or on the trading prices of our common stock the risks and uncertainties described in this annual report on form 10k are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties that currently are not known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may adversely affect our businesses and operations9table of contentssignificant fluctuations and volatility in the price of various input costs such as cotton and oilrelated materials utilities freight and wages may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flowsinflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins for example the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process such as oilrelated commodity prices and other raw materials such as dyes and chemicals and other costs such as fuel energy and utility costs can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors similarly a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the value of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs sudden decreases in the costs for materials including cotton may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production which could result in lower profitability particularly if these decreases result in downward price pressure if in the future we incur volatility in the costs for materials including cotton and labor that we are unable to offset through price adjustments or improved efficiencies or if our competitors unwillingness to follow our price changes results in downward price pressure our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affectedbusinesses that we may acquire may fail to perform to expectations and we may be unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses with our existing businessfrom time to time we may evaluate potential acquisition opportunities to support and strengthen our business in october 2013 we acquired maidenform the acquisition and integration of businesses such as maidenform involve a number of riskswe may not be able to realize all or a substantial portion of the anticipated benefits of the maidenform acquisition and other future acquisitions that we may consummate maidenform and other future acquired businesses may not achieve expected results of operations including expected levels of revenues and may require unanticipated costs and expenditures in addition following completion of the maidenform acquisition or other future acquisitions we may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that we and the acquired business have achieved or might achieve separately maidenform and other acquired businesses may also subject us to liabilities that we were unable to discover in the course of our due diligence and our rights to indemnification from the sellers of such other businesses even if obtained may not be sufficient to offset the relevant liabilities in addition the integration of maidenform and other newly acquired businesses may be expensive and timeconsuming and may not be entirely successful integration of the acquired businesses may also place additional pressures on our systems of internal control over financial reporting the process of integrating the operations of maidenform or those of any other future acquisition could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel if we are unable to successfully integrate maidenform and other newly acquired businesses or if maidenform or other acquired businesses fail to produce targeted results it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial conditioneconomic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products reduce access to credit and cause our customers suppliers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship all of which could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flowsalthough the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers discretionary spending is affected by many factors that are outside of our control including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit currency exchange rates taxation energy prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending reduced sales at our wholesale customers may lead to lower retail inventory levels reduced orders to us or order cancellations these lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets may result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this may result in higher credit risk relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flowsin addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our suppliers of raw materials and finished goods logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and derivatives transactions in addition the inability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase if third parties on which we rely for raw materials finished goods or services are unable to overcome financial difficulties and provide us with the materials and services we need or if counterparties to our credit facilities or derivatives transactions do not perform their obligations our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected10table of contentsour operations in international markets and our earnings in those markets may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risksduring 2013 net sales from our international segment were 496 million representing approximately 11 of total net sales in addition a significant amount of our manufacturing and production operations are located or our products are sourced from outside the united states as a result our business is subject to risks associated with international operations these risks include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations unexpected changes in tariffs taxes or regulatory requirements and political unrest and corruptionregulatory changes could limit the countries in which we sell produce or source our products or significantly increase the cost of operating in or obtaining materials originating from certain countries restrictions imposed by such changes can have a particular impact on our business when after we have moved our operations to a particular location new unfavorable regulations are enacted in that area or favorable regulations currently in effect are changedcountries in which our products are manufactured or sold may from time to time impose additional new regulations or modify existing regulations includingchanges in duties taxes tariffs and other charges on importslimitations on the quantity of goods which may be imported into the united states from a particular countryrequirements as to where products andor inputs are manufactured or sourcedcreation of export licensing requirements imposition of restrictions on export quantities or specification of minimum export pricing andor export prices or dutieslimitations on foreign owned businesses orgovernment actions to cancel contracts redenominate the official currency renounce or default on obligations renegotiate terms unilaterally or expropriate assetsin addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operationswe are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act in addition to the anticorruption laws of the foreign countries in which we operate although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business reputation and operating resultswe operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market and our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively in the futurethe basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly competition is generally based upon brand comfort fit style and price our businesses face competition today from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers as well as department stores and other retailers including many of our customers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands in our activewear segment we also face competition in the branded printwear category from other manufacturers with respect to the sale of lowermargin products to wholesalers and third party embellishers whose purchasing decisions are primarily driven by price rather than brand name recognition increased competition may result in a loss of or a reduction in shelf space and promotional support and reduced prices in each case decreasing our cash flows operating margins and profitability our ability to remain competitive in the areas of price quality brand recognition research and product development manufacturing and distribution will in large part determine our future success if we fail to compete successfully our market share results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affectedunanticipated business disruptions could affect our ability to provide our products to our customerswe have a complex global supply chain and distribution network that supports our ability consistently to provide our products to our customers factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control like system failures weather natural disasters fire terrorism interruptions in the availability of basic services and infrastructure generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers or distributors operations if we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or 11table of contentsdistribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or be unable to deliver products to our customers these events could result in reputational damage lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns all of the foregoing can have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flowsthe loss of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw materials may interrupt our supplies and materially harm our businesswe purchase all of the raw materials used in our products and approximately 33 of the cost of sales derived from apparel designed by us from a limited number of third party suppliers and manufacturers our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of raw materials and finished products from our third party suppliers and manufacturers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of our principal third party suppliers or manufacturers experience financial difficulties that they are not able to overcome resulting from worldwide economic conditions production problems difficulties in sourcing raw materials lack of capacity or transportation disruptions or if for these or other reasons they raise the prices of the raw materials or finished products we purchase from them the magnitude of this risk depends upon the timing of any interruptions the materials or products that the third party manufacturers provide and the volume of productionour dependence on third parties for raw materials and finished products subjects us to the risk of supplier failure and customer dissatisfaction with the quality of our products quality failures by our third party manufacturers or changes in their financial or business condition that affect their production could disrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers and thereby materially harm our businessour results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to manage our inventory effectively and accurately forecast demand for our productswe are faced with the constant challenge of balancing our inventory with our ability to meet marketplace needs factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to evolving consumer preferences and trends and to translate these preferences and trends into marketable product offerings as well as unanticipated changes in general economic conditions or other factors which result in cancellations of orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailersinventory reserves can result from the complexity of our supply chain a long manufacturing process and the seasonal nature of certain products we sell a large number of our products to a small number of customers and these customers generally are not required by contract to purchase our goods as a result we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with thirdparty manufacturers before our customers orders are firm if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices which could have an adverse effect on the image and reputation of our brands and negatively impact profitability on the other hand if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or thirdparty manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to our reputation and relationships these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition additionally sudden decreases in the costs for materials including cotton may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production if this occurs it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flow particularly if we hold a large amount of excess inventory excess inventory charges can reduce gross margins or result in operating losses lowered plant and equipment utilization and lowered fixed operating cost absorption all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flowsany inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure with respect to our information technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our businessour ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with integrating various data sources challenges in transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of our business moreover we and our customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in our systems it could also require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure problem or breach in addition any such failure problem or breach could harm our reputation which could adversely impact our business12table of contentsour business depends on our senior management team and other key personnelour success depends upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel some of whom have unique talents and experience and would be difficult to replace the loss or interruption of the services of a member of our senior management team or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business during the transitional period that would be required for a successor to assume the responsibilities of the position our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain key managers sales people and others we may not be able to attract or retain these employees which could adversely affect our businesswe have a complex multinational tax structure and changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could impact our capital deployment strategy and adversely affect our resultswe have a complex multinational tax structure with multiple types of intercompany transactions and our allocation of profits and losses among us and our subsidiaries through our intercompany transfer pricing agreements is subject to review by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns and related transfer pricing documentation by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition additionally changes in tax laws regulations future jurisdictional profitability of the company and our subsidiaries and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record as well as our capital deployment strategy which could adversely affect our results of operationsfailure to comply with laws rules and regulations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance our business is subject to federal state local and international laws rules and regulations such as state and local wage and hour laws the us foreign corrupt practices act the false claims act the employee retirement income security act erisa securities laws import and export laws including customs regulations unclaimed property laws and many others the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to changes in legal and regulatory requirements increased enforcement and our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels in addition as a result of operating in multiple countries we must comply with multiple foreign laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country and may conflict with corresponding us laws and regulations we may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies which can occur in the ordinary course of business or which can result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency towards an industry country or practice if we fail to comply with laws rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied we may be subject to government enforcement action class action litigation or other litigation damage to our reputation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties and increased cost of regulatory compliance any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performancewe rely on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales and the loss of or material reduction in sales to any of our top customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flowsin 2013 our top 10 customers accounted for 65 of our net sales and our top two customers walmart and target accounted for 27 and 19 of our net sales respectively we expect that these customers will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales in the future moreover our top customers are the largest market participants in our primary distribution channels across all of our product lines we generally do not enter into purchase agreements that obligate our customers to purchase our products and as a result most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis a decision by any of our top customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from us could substantially reduce revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition if any of our customers devote less selling space to apparel products our sales to those customers could be reduced even if we maintain our share of their apparel business any such reduction in apparel selling space could result in lower sales and our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected13table of contentsif we are unsuccessful in establishing effective advertising marketing and promotional programs our sales could be negatively affectedinadequate or ineffective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales additionally if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditionour failure to properly manage strategic projects in order to achieve the desired results may negatively impact our businessthe implementation of our business strategy periodically involves the execution of complex projects which places significant demands on our management accounting financial information and other systems and on our business our ability to successfully implement such projects is dependent on managements ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these our changing business needs we cannot assure you that our management will be able to manage these projects effectively or implement them successfully if we miscalculate the resources or time we need to complete a project or fail to implement the project effectively our business and operating results could be adversely affected due to the extensive nature of our foreign operations fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operationswe sell a majority of our products in transactions denominated in us dollars however we purchase many of our raw materials pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies as a result when the us dollar weakens against any of these currencies our cost of sales could increase substantially outside the united states we may pay for materials or finished products in us dollars and in some cases a strengthening of the us dollar could effectively increase our costs where we use foreign currency to purchase the us dollars we need to make such payments we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates we are also exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our financial statements due to the translation of operating results and financial position of our foreign subsidiariesif we fail to maintain effective internal controls we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or timely or prevent or detect fraud which could have a material adverse effect on our business or the market price of our securitieseffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent or detect fraud if we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent or detect fraud our brands and operating results could be harmed pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we are required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting including managements assessment of the effectiveness of such control internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business or the market price of our securitieswe may suffer negative publicity if we or our third party manufacturers violate labor laws or engage in practices that are viewed as unethical or illegal which could cause a loss of businesswe cannot fully control the business and labor practices of our third party manufacturers the majority of whom are located in asia central america and the caribbean basin if one of our own manufacturing operations or one of our third party manufacturers violates or is accused of violating local or international labor laws or other applicable regulations or engages in labor or other practices that would be viewed in any market in which our products are sold as unethical we could suffer negative publicity which could tarnish our brands image or result in a loss of sales in addition if such negative publicity affected one of our customers it could result in a loss of business for us14table of contentschanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could increase our income taxes and decrease our net incomewe are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the amount of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the united states changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in tax laws adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns and other factors in order to service our debt obligations we may need to increase the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the united states which may significantly increase our income tax expense additionally our strategic initiative to enhance our global supply chain by optimizing lowercost manufacturing capacity and to support our commercial operations outside the united states may result in capital investments outside the united states that impact our income tax expenseour existing customers may require products on an exclusive basis forms of economic support and other changes that could be harmful to our businesscustomers increasingly may require us to provide them with some of our products on an exclusive basis which could cause an increase in the number of stock keeping units or skus we must carry and consequently increase our inventory levels and working capital requirements moreover our customers may increasingly seek markdown allowances incentives and other forms of economic support which reduce our gross margins and affect our profitability our financial performance is negatively affected by these pricing pressures when we are forced to reduce our prices without being able to correspondingly reduce our production coststhe success of our business is tied to the strength and reputation of our brands including brands that we license to other parties if other parties take actions that weaken harm the reputation of or cause confusion with our brands our business and consequently our sales results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affectedwe license some of our important trademarks to third parties for example we license champion to third parties for athleticoriented accessories although we make concerted efforts to protect our brands through quality control mechanisms and contractual obligations imposed on our licensees there is a risk that some licensees may not be in full compliance with those mechanisms and obligations in that event or if a licensee engages in behavior with respect to the licensed marks that would cause us reputational harm we could experience a significant downturn in that brands business adversely affecting our sales and results of operations similarly any misuse of the wonderbra or playtex brands by sun capital could result in negative publicity and a loss of sales for our products under these brands any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flowswe design manufacture source and sell products under trademarks that are licensed from third parties if any licensor takes actions related to their trademarks that would cause their brands or our company reputational harm our business may be adversely affectedwe design manufacture source and sell a number of our products under trademarks that are licensed from third parties such as our polo ralph lauren mens underwear and our donna karan and dkny intimate apparel because we do not control the brands licensed to us our licensors could make changes to their brands or business models that could result in a significant downturn in a brands business adversely affecting our sales and results of operations if any licensor engages in behavior with respect to the licensed marks that would cause us reputational harm or if any of the brands licensed to us violates the trademark rights of another or are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable we could experience a significant downturn in that brands business adversely affecting our sales and results of operations and we may be required to expend significant amounts on public relations advertising and possibly legal feeswe are prohibited from selling our wonderbra and playtex intimate apparel products in the european union as well as certain other countries in europe and south africa and therefore are unable to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise in such countriessun capital has an exclusive perpetual royaltyfree license to manufacture sell and distribute apparel products under the wonderbra and playtex trademarks in the member states of the european union as well as russia south africa switzerland and certain other nations in europe due to the exclusive license we are not permitted to sell wonderbra and playtex branded products in these nations and sun capital is not permitted to sell wonderbra and playtex branded products outside of these nations consequently we will not be able to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise relating to the sale of wonderbra and playtex products in these nations for more information on these sales restrictions see business  intellectual property15table of contentsif we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our business may be adversely affectedour trademarks and copyrights are important to our marketing efforts and have substantial value we aggressively protect these trademarks and copyrights from infringement and dilution through appropriate measures including court actions and administrative proceedings we are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing our intellectual property rights infringement or counterfeiting of our products could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect our business actions we have taken to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the united states or other countries such as changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on our ability to enforce those rightsthe value of our intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks we are from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some items of our intellectual propertywe are subject to certain risks as a result of our indebtednessour indebtedness includes the 11 billion revolving credit facility the revolving loan facility under our senior secured credit facility the senior secured credit facility our 1 billion 6375 senior notes due 2020 the 6375 senior notes and the 225 million accounts receivable securitization facility the accounts receivable securitization facilitythe senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the 6375 senior notes contain restrictions that affect and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit among other things our ability to borrow funds pay dividends or make other distributions make investments engage in transactions with affiliates or create liens on our assets covenants in the senior secured credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total debt to ebitda earnings before income taxes depreciation expense and amortization or leverage ratio these restrictions and covenants could limit our ability to obtain additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions meet our debt payment obligations and capital commitments fund any operating losses or future development of our business affiliates obtain lower borrowing costs that are available from secured lenders or engage in advantageous transactions that monetize our assets or conduct other necessary or prudent corporate activities any failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default that accelerates the maturity of our indebtedness under such facilities resulting in an adverse effect on our businessthe lenders under the senior secured credit facility have received a pledge of substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries with certain customary or agreedupon exceptions for foreign subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries additionally these lenders generally have a lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our us subsidiaries with certain exceptions the financial institutions that are party to the accounts receivable securitization facility have a lien on certain of our domestic accounts receivable as a result of these pledges and liens if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the senior secured credit facility or the accounts receivable securitization facility the lenders under those facilities will be entitled to foreclose on substantially all of our assets and at their option liquidate these assets which would adversely impact the operations of our businessour indebtedness also could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have lower levels of debt these competitors could have greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions secure additional financing for their operations by incurring additional debt expend capital to expand their manufacturing and production operations to lowercost areas and apply pricing pressure on us in addition because many of our customers rely on us to fulfill a substantial portion of their basic apparel demand any concern these customers may have regarding our financial condition may cause them to reduce the amount of products they purchase from us our debt service obligations could also impede our ability to withstand downturns in our industry or the economymarket returns could have a negative impact on the return on plan assets for our pension which may require significant fundingthe plan assets of our pension plans which had a return of approximately 13 and 11 during 2013 and 2012 respectively are invested mainly in domestic and international equities bonds and real estate we are unable to predict the variations in asset values or the severity or duration of any disruptions in the financial markets or adverse economic conditions in the united states europe and asia the funded status of these plans and the related cost reflected in our financial 16table of contentsstatements are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty particularly in the current economic environment under the pension protection act of 2006 the pension protection act losses of asset values may necessitate increased funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements under the pension protection act funding rules our us qualified pension plan is approximately 82 funded as of december 28 2013 any downward pressure on the asset values of these plans may require us to fund obligations earlier than we had originally planned which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operationsour balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as a noncash expense in our consolidated statement of incomegoodwill trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually the fair value of the goodwill assigned to a business unit could decline if projected revenues or cash flows were to be lower in the future due to effects of the global economy or other causes if the carrying value of intangible assets or of goodwill were to exceed its fair value the asset would be written down to its fair value with the impairment loss recognized as a noncash charge in the consolidated statement of incomeas of december 28 2013 we had approximately 626 million of goodwill and 378 million of trademarks and other identifiable intangibles on our balance sheet which together represent 25 of our total assets no impairment was identified in 2013 changes in the future outlook of a business unit could result in an impairment loss which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditionour balance sheet includes a significant amount of deferred tax assets we must generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax benefitsas of december 28 2013 we had approximately 404 million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet which represents 10 of our total assets deferred tax assets relate to temporary differences differences between the assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the assets and liabilities in the calculation of taxable income the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax benefits will not be realized if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets which would cause an increase in our effective tax rate a significant increase in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operationswe had approximately 49700 employees worldwide as of december 28 2013 and our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with

compensation rates citizenship requirements and payroll taxes which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs approximately 41400 of those employees were outside of the united states a significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have employees could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases all of which may cause us to incur additional costs expend resources responding to such increases and lower our marginsin addition approximately 250 of our employees in the united states are members of labor organizations or are covered by collective bargaining agreements if there were a significant increase in the number of our employees who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements we would become vulnerable to a strike work stoppage or other labor action by these employees that could have an adverse

underwear childrens underwear activewear socks and hosiery our brands hold either the number one or number two us market position by units sold in most product categories in which we competemaidenform acquisitionin october 2013 we expanded our portfolio of brands through the acquisition of maidenform a global intimate apparel company maidenform is a leading seller of bras shapewear and panties under brands such as maidenform flexees lilyette self expressions and sweet nothings as well as donna karan and dkny intimate apparel under license the acquisition is expected to create growth and cost savings opportunities and increased scale to serve retailers the acquisition was an all cash transaction valued at approximately 581 million under the terms of the agreement maidenform stockholders received 2350 in cash for each share of maidenform common stock we funded the acquisition with cash on hand and shortterm borrowings under our revolving loan facility which we plan to retire through free cash flowwe incurred 81 million of charges in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to the maidenform acquisition integration and other action related costs our current estimate for pretax charges in 2014 for acquisition and other actions is approximately 70 million to 100 million or more but actual charges could vary significantly our segments our operations are managed and reported in four operating segments each of which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes innerwear activewear direct to consumer and international in the first quarter of 2013 we 25table of contentsrenamed the outerwear segment to activewear to reflect the trend of this category becoming a part of consumers active lifestyles and more aptly describe the competitive space of this business these segments are organized principally by product category geographic location and distribution channel each segment has its own management that is responsible for the operations of the segments businesses but the segments share a common supply chain and media and marketing platforms in the first quarter of 2013 we decided to revise the manner in which we allocate certain selling general and administrative expenses certain prioryear segment operating profit disclosures have been revised to conform to the currentyear presentation the operating results for maidenform are included in our innerwear direct to consumer and international segments based on geographic location and distribution channel the reportable segments are as followsinnerwear sells basic branded products that are replenishment in nature under the product categories of intimate apparel mens underwear childrens underwear and socksactivewear sells basic branded products that are primarily seasonal in nature to both retailers and wholesalers as well as licensed logo apparel in collegiate bookstores and other channelsdirect to consumer includes our companyoperated outlet stores catalogs and website operations that sell our branded products directly to consumersinternational primarily relates to the asia latin america canada and australia geographic locations that sell products that span across the innerwear and activewear reportable segmentsoutlook for 2014 we expect our 2014 full year sales to be slightly less than 51 billion with maidenform contributing approximately 500 millioninterest and other related expense is expected to be approximately 85 million including approximately 10 million from the higher debt balances associated with the maidenform acquisitionwe estimate our full year tax rate to be in the low teens with slightly higher rates in the first half of the yearwe expect cash flow from operations to be 450 million to 550 million for the full year which includes approximately 60 million of expected pension contributions net capital expenditures are expected to be between 60 million and 70 million while annual dividend payments are estimated to be roughly 120 millionbusiness and industry trendsinflation and changing pricescotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products while we have sold our yarn operations we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our largescale yarn suppliers and may result in the need to implement future price increases in order to maintain our margins decreases in cotton prices can lead to lower margins for inventory and products produced from cotton we have already purchased particularly if there is downward price pressure as a result of consumer demand competition or other factors our costs for cotton yarn and cottonbased textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton which is affected by among other factors weather consumer demand speculation on the commodities market the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control we are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton under our agreements with these suppliers we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases when we elect to fix the cotton cost component under these agreements interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of yarn the yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is their responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton suppliers however our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices the cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us represented only approximately 7 of our cost of sales in 2013 costs incurred today for materials and labor including cotton typically do not impact our results until the inventory is sold approximately six to nine months laterinflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins for example the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process such as oilrelated commodities and other raw materials such as dyes and chemicals and other costs such as fuel energy and utility costs can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into 26table of contentsinventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold in addition a significant portion of our products are manufactured in countries other than the united states and declines in the value of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs increases in inflation may not be matched by rises in consumer income which also could have a negative impact on spendingother business and industry trendsthe basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price product quality selection service and purchasing convenience the majority of our core styles continue from year to year with variations only in color fabric or design details some products however such as intimate apparel activewear and sheer hosiery do have more of an emphasis on style and innovation our businesses face competition from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers as well as smaller companies department stores specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brandsour top 10 customers accounted for 65 of our net sales our largest customers in 2013 were walmart target and kohls which accounted for 27 19 and 6 of total sales respectively the increasing bargaining power of retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek greater concessions in their purchase of our products while also demanding exclusivity of some of our products to counteract these effects it has become increasingly important to leverage our national brands through investment in our largest and strongest brands as our customers strive to maximize their performance especially in todays challenging economic environment brands are important in our core categories to drive traffic and project the quality and value our customers demandour key business strategiesour innovatetoelevate strategy integrates our brand superiority industryleading innovation and lowcost supply chain to provide higher valued products while lowering production

campaignsthe second element of our innovatetoelevate strategy is platform innovation we are not interested in newness or fashion but rather focus on identifying the longterm megatrends that will impact our categories over the next five to 10 years once we have identified these trends we utilize a disciplined bigidea process to put more science into the art of apparel our approach to innovation is to focus on big platforms our tagless apparel platform smart sizes bra platform and comfortblend and xtemp fabric platforms incorporate bigidea innovation to span brands product categories business segments retailer and distribution channels and geographies we are focused on driving innovation that is margin accretive and that can leverage our supply chain in order to drive further economies of scale the third element of our innovatetoelevate strategy is our lowcost global supply chain we seek to expand margins through optimizing our lowcost global supply chain and streamlining our operations to reduce costs we believe that we are able to leverage our significant scale of operations to provide us with greater manufacturing efficiencies purchasing power and product design marketing and customer management resources than our smaller competitors our global supply chain spans across both the western and eastern hemispheres and provides us with a balanced approach to product supply which relies on a combination of owned contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions increases the efficiency of our operations reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply our global supply chain enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres thereby diversifying our production risks we have generated significant cost savings margin expansion and contributions to cash flow and will continue to do so as we further optimize our size scale and production capability we generated efficiency savings from our supply chain optimization initiatives of approximately 40 million during 2013we seek to effectively generate strong cash flow through optimizing our capital structure and managing working capital levels our strong cash flows have resulted in a flexible longterm capital structure that is able to deliver shareholder value in numerous ways including debt reduction and our ability to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions 27table of contentsseasonality and other factorsour operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors generally our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items we generally have higher sales during the backtoschool and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather which benefits certain product categories such as fleece sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us media advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductionsalthough the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned rather than on an impulse basis our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers discretionary spending is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit taxation gasoline prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside our control consumers purchases of discretionary items including our products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions these consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or to purchase lowerpriced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to timechanges in product sales mix can impact our gross profit as the percentage of our sales attributable to higher margin products such as intimate apparel and mens underwear and lower margin products such as activewear fluctuate from time to time in addition sales attributable to higher and lower margin products within the same product category fluctuate from time to time our customers may change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us which makes trends in product sales mix difficult to predict however certain changes in product sales mix are seasonal in nature as sales of socks hosiery and fleece products generally have higher sales during the last two quarters july to december of each fiscal year as a result of cooler weather backtoschool shopping and holidays while other changes in product mix may be attributable to customers preferences and discretionary spending2013 highlightsnet sales in 2013 were 463 billion compared with 453 billion in 2012 representing a 2 increaseoperating profit was 515 million in 2013 compared with 440 million in

billion of which 74 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested and less than 1 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are not considered permanently reinvested our intention is to reinvest the cash and cash equivalents of those entities whose undistributed earnings we have previously asserted as being permanently reinvested in our international operations we reassess our reinvestment assertions each reporting period and currently believe that we have sufficient other sources of liquidity to support our assertion that such undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be considered to be reinvested permanentlywe repatriated 10 million 20 million and 28 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively from earnings generated in such years the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated in the past has been determined and the amount that we expect to repatriate during 2014 will be determined based upon a variety of factors including current year earnings of the foreign subsidiaries foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the us such as for the repayment of debt and other domestic obligations the majority of our repatriation of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries has historically occurred at yearend although we may always repatriate funds earlier in the year based on the needs of our business when we repatriate funds to the us we are required to pay taxes on these amounts based on applicable us tax 40table of contentsrates net of any foreign tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against us income tax we paid 1 million 0 and 2 million in additional us federal income taxes in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in such years we do not currently expect the amount of repatriated foreign earnings or the resulting additional tax expense in 2014 to differ materially from prior fiscal yearscritical accounting policies and estimateswe have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our financial statementsthe application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures these estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors are described belowsales recognition and incentiveswe recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement ii the sales price is fixed or determinable iii title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured which occurs primarily upon shipment we record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and current customer information our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experiencenote 2d summary of significant accounting policies  sales recognition and incentives to our financial statements describes a variety of sales incentives that we offer to resellers and consumers of our products measuring the cost of these incentives requires in many cases estimating future customer utilization and redemption rates we use historical data for similar transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive programs our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience and other available information we classify the costs associated with cooperative advertising as a reduction of net sales in our consolidated statements of incomeaccounts receivable valuationaccounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers we carry our accounts receivable at their net realizable value in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the selling general and administrative expenses line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are primarily reflected as a reduction in the net sales line of our consolidated statements of income our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a large reserve might be required the amount of actual historical losses has not varied materially from our estimates for bad debtsinventory valuationwe carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout or fifo method for our inventories we carry obsolete damaged and excess inventory at the net realizable value which we determine by assessing historical recovery rates current market conditions and our future marketing and sales plans because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time there are inherent uncertainties related to our value determination market factors and other conditions underlying the net realizable value may change resulting in further reserve requirements a reduction in the carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be reversed at a later period while we believe that adequate writedowns for inventory obsolescence have 41table of contentsbeen provided in the financial statements consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory writedowns in the futurerebates discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is soldincome taxesdeferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of our assets and liabilities as well as for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies if in our judgment it appears that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets which increase income tax expense in the period when such determination is madewe have not provided federal income taxes on that portion of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings that is permanently reinvested in their respective foreign jurisdictions if we decided to remit those earnings to the us in a future period due to anticipated cash flow or other business requirements our federal income tax provision and effective tax rate could be impactedwe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution these assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits expiration of statutes of limitations as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations income tax expense is adjusted

plan is approximately 82 funded as of december 28 2013 compared to 84 funded as of december 29 2012 we expect to make required cash contributions of approximately 62 million to our pension plans in 2014 based on a preliminary calculation by our actuary in addition to the required cash contributions we may elect to make voluntary contributions to maintain an 80 funded level which will avoid certain benefit payment restrictions under the pension protection act see note 16 defined benefit pension plans to our financial statements for more information on the plan asset components the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans are recognized on our balance sheet and changes in the funded status are reflected in comprehensive income we measure the funded status of our plans as of the date of our fiscal year endthe net periodic cost of the pension plans is determined using projections and actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the longterm rate of asset return the net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in the year incurred gains and losses which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions are amortized over the average future expected life of participants as benefits under the hanesbrands inc pension plan are frozen year over year fluctuations in our pension expense are not expected to be material and not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income 42table of contentsour policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as followsin determining the discount rate we utilized the aon hewitt aa above median curve rounded to the nearest 10 basis points in order to determine a unique interest rate for each plan and match the expected cash flows for each plan salary increase assumptions were based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions the salary increase assumption only applies to the canadian plans and portions of the hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans as benefits under these plans are not frozen the benefits under the hanesbrands inc pension plan were frozen as of december 31 2005in determining the longterm rate of return on plan assets we applied a proportionally weighted blend between assuming the historical longterm compound growth rate of the plan portfolio would predict the future returns of similar investments and the utilization of forward looking assumptionsretirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while standard actuarial tables were used to estimate mortalitythe

natrademarks and other identifiable intangiblestrademarks license agreements customer and distributor relationships and computer software are our primary identifiable intangible assets we amortize identifiable intangibles with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and we do not amortize identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives we base the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors including the effects of demand competition expected changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows as of december 28 2013 the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was 378 million of which we are amortizing a balance of 158 million we anticipate that our amortization expense for 2014 will be 20 millionwe evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate asset amortization described below under  depreciation and impairment of property plant and equipment we assess identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter and more often as triggering events occur in order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets we compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount fair values of intangible assets are primarily based on future cash flows projected to be generated from that asset we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which an identifiable intangible assets carrying value exceeds its fair valuegoodwillas of december 28 2013 we had 626 million of goodwill we do not amortize goodwill but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur the timing of our annual goodwill impairment testing is the first day of the third fiscal quarter the estimated fair values significantly exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter and no impairment of goodwill was identified as a result of the testing conducted in 2013in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill in 2013 we estimated the fair value of our reporting units we relied on a number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results business plans and present value techniques as discussed above under trademarks and other identifiable intangibles there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them and the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known43table of contentsassets and liabilities acquired in business combinationswe account for business combinations using the purchase method which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date we recognize the excess of an acquired business cost over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as goodwill we use a variety of information sources to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities we generally use third party appraisers to determine the fair value and lives of property and identifiable intangibles consulting actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans and legal counsel to assess obligations associated with legal and environmental claimsdepreciation and impairment of property plant and equipmentwe state property plant and equipment at its historical cost and we compute depreciation using the straightline method over the assets life we estimate an assets life based on historical experience manufacturers estimates engineering or appraisal evaluations our future business plans and the period over which the asset will economically benefit us which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life our policies require that we periodically review our assets remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization a change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periodswe test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable such events include significant adverse changes in business climate several periods of operating or cash flow losses forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life we evaluate an assets recoverability by comparing the asset or asset groups net carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset or asset group will generate if we determine that an asset is not recoverable we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair valuewhen we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use we depreciate the assets adjusted

contractually fixed prices that are above the current market rate our costs for cotton yarn and cottonbased textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton which is affected by among other things weather consumer demand speculation on the commodities market the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control we are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business

the cotton cost component under these agreements interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of yarn the yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is their responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton suppliers however our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices the cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us represented approximately 7 of our cost of sales in 2013 costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold for example we estimate that an increase of 001 per pound in cotton prices at current levels of production would affect our annual cost of sales by 3 million related to finished goods manufactured internally in our manufacturing facilities and 1 million related to finished goods sourced by third parties the ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified as the effect of movements in cotton prices on industry selling prices are uncertain but any dramatic increase in the price of cotton could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally significant decreases in the price of cotton may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production which could result in lower gross margins particularly if these decreases result in downward price pressurein addition fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices may influence the prices of other raw materials we use to manufacture our products such as chemicals dyestuffs polyester yarn and foam we generally purchase raw materials at market prices we estimate that a change of 1000 per barrel in the price of oil would affect our freight costs by approximately 5 million at current levels of usage item 8financial statements and

such events include significant adverse changes in the business climate several periods of operating or cash flow losses forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life recoverability of property is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value when an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used the adjusted carrying amount of those assets is depreciated over its remaining useful

identifiable intangible assets of the company are trademarks license agreements customer and distributor relationships and computer software identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are

to that used in evaluating elements of property identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter and as triggering events occur the impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess in assessing fair value management relies on a number of factors to discount

goodwillgoodwill is the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination when a business combination is completed the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are assigned to the reporting unit or units of the company given responsibility for managing controlling and generating returns on these assets and liabilities in many instances all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities are assigned to a single reporting unit and in these cases all of the goodwill is assigned to the same reporting unit in those situations in which the acquired assets and liabilities are allocated to more than one reporting unit the goodwill to be assigned to each reporting unit is determined in a manner similar to how the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determinedgoodwill is not amortized however it is assessed for impairment at least annually and as triggering events occur the companys annual measurement date is the first day of the third fiscal quarter in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units and compares it to the carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the next step of the process involves comparing the implied fair value to the carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit if the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess no

further interpretations of regulations income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which these events occur and these adjustments are included in the companys consolidated statements of income if such changes take place there is a risk that the companys effective tax rate may increase or decrease in any period a company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial

uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposures to movements in foreign exchange rates the use of these financial instruments modifies the companys exposure to these risks with the goal of reducing the risk or cost to the company depending on the nature of the underlying risk being hedged these financial instruments are either designated as cash flow hedges or are economic hedges against changes in the value of the hedged item and therefore not designated as hedges for accounting purposes the company does not use derivatives for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivative contractson the date the derivative is entered into the company determines whether the derivative meets the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting treatment or whether the financial instrument is serving as an economic hedge against changes in the value of the hedged item and therefore is not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes the accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationshipthe company formally documents its hedge relationships including identifying the hedging instruments and the hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction this process includes linking derivatives that are designated as hedges of specific assets liabilities firm commitments or forecasted transactions the company also formally assesses both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item if it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge or if the anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur the company discontinues hedge accounting and any deferred gains or losses are recorded in the selling general and administrative expenses line of the consolidated statements of incomederivatives are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and classified as current or noncurrent based on the derivatives maturity dates the fair value is based upon either market quotes for actively traded instruments or independent bids for nonexchange traded instruments cash flows hedges are classified in the same category as the item being hedged and cash flows from derivative contracts not designated as hedges are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of

of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive loss line of the consolidated balance sheets when the hedged item affects the income

plan participants and their beneficiaries to accomplish this goal the assets of the plan are broadly diversified to protect against large investment losses and to reduce the likelihood of excessive volatility of returns diversification of assets is achieved through strategic allocations to various asset classes as well as various investment styles within these asset classes and by retaining multiple third party investment management firms with complementary investment styles and philosophies to implement these allocations the company has established a target asset allocation based upon analysis of riskreturn tradeoffs and correlations of asset mixes given longterm historical data prospective capital market returns and forecasted liabilities of the plans the target asset allocation approximates the actual asset allocation as of december 28 2013 in addition to volatility protection diversification enables the assets of the plan the best opportunity to provide adequate returns in order to meet the companys investment return objectives these objectives include over a rolling 5year period to achieve a total return which exceeds the required actuarial rate of return for the plan and to outperform a passive portfolio consisting of a similar asset allocationthe company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the pension plan assets at
