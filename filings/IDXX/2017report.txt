differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those factors discussed elsewhere in this report 		 		 			  		 		 			our business lines are highly competitive and our failure to successfully execute certain strategies could have a material negative impact on our growth and profitability  		 		 			  		 		 			the companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy including  		 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			developing manufacturing and marketing innovative new or improved and cost competitive inclinic laboratory analyzers that drive sales of idexx vetlab instruments grow our installed base of instruments and increase demand for related recurring sales of consumable products services and

differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of the information and transactions of these products and the management of diagnostic information derived from our products 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			providing our veterinary customers with the medical and business tools information and resources that enable them to grow their practices through increased pet visits and enhanced practice of realtime care 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			achieving cost improvements in our worldwide network of reference laboratories by implementing global best practices including lean processing techniques incorporating technological enhancements including laboratory automation and a global laboratory information management system employing purchasing strategies to maximize leverage of our global scale increasing the leverage of existing infrastructure and consolidating testing in high volume laboratory hubs 		 			 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			achieving cost improvements in the manufacture and service of our inclinic laboratory analyzers by employing the benefits of economies of scale in both negotiating supply contracts and leveraging manufacturing overhead and by improving reliability of our instruments 		 			 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			continuing to expand develop and advance the productivity of our companion animal diagnostic sales marketing customer support and logistics

profitability may be negatively impacted 		 		 			 		 		 			our dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			we rely on thirdparty suppliers to provide components in our products manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves including packagedelivery services because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives actions taken by them could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations the risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with thirdparty suppliers on reasonable terms inconsistent or inadequate quality control relocation of supplier facilities supplier work stoppages and suppliers failure to comply with applicable regulations or their contractual obligations problems with suppliers could materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market substantially decrease sales lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers 		 		 			 		 		 			in addition we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include the majority of our catalyst dx and catalyst one consumables vetlyte electrolyte consumables procyte dx hematology idexx vetautoread hematology vettest chemistry analyzers and related consumables and accessories sedivue dx urine sediment analyzer image capture plates used in our diagnostic imaging systems and certain components and raw materials used in our snap rapid assay kits and snap pro mobile device catalyst one lasercyte and lasercyte dx hematology analyzers livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products and water testing products to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers we seek when possible to enter into longterm contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices however some suppliers decline to enter into longterm contracts and we are required to purchase products with short term contracts or on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers we may be unable to supply the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			 		 		 			our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market  		 		 			  		 		 			many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products which are products that include materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products samples and the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products and could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			20 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			 		 		 			we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense our competitors in the veterinary diagnostic market include companies that develop manufacture and sell veterinary diagnostic tests and commercial veterinary reference laboratories as well as corporate hospital chains that operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals such as vca inc formerly named vca antech inc in january 2017 mars incorporated and vca announced that mars incorporated agreed to acquire vca with the acquisition expected to close in the third quarter of 2017 if this acquisition closes it could result in the combination of two large us veterinary hospital chains into a vertically integrated corporate hospital chain providing reference laboratory services to its hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals while we believe that our reference laboratory service offerings are competitively differentiated due to our proprietary products and services such as the idexx sdma test there can be no assurance that increased consolidation and reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers would not have a negative impact on our ability to compete for more information regarding the risks presented by consolidation and reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers see consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business below 		 		 			 		 		 			competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets through the development of new technology the acquisition of rights to use existing technologies or the use of existing technologies when patents protecting such existing technologies expire new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services which could be superior to our products and services some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services similar to ours at lower sales prices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering with our transition to an alldirect sales strategy for our kits and consumables in the us effective january 1 2015 we did not renew our distribution agreements with our former key us distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014 including exclusive distribution agreements with some of the largest us distributors of companion animal veterinary products our former us distribution partners currently promote and sell competitive instruments consumables and rapid assay products which may adversely affect the retention of our customers for our kits and consumables and the sales and distribution of our products which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies also have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do 		 		 			 		 		 			various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 		 		 			  		 		 			in the us the manufacture and sale of certain of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda or the epa our diagnostic tests for animal health applications that involve the detection of infectious diseases including most rapid assay canine and feline snap tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our dairy testing products require approval by the fda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa the manufacture and sale of our opti line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us in addition delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability  		 		 			 		 		 			the manufacture and sale of our products as well as our research and development processes are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries for example the european union regulates the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products or processes these regulations include the biocidal products regulation which may require approval for the use of certain biocides in our products prior to being used or sold in the european union and the european regulation for registration evaluation authorization  		 		  		 			21 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		and restriction of chemical substances or reach which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the european union compliance with these regulations and similar regulations that may be adopted elsewhere may require registration of the applicable substances or the redesign or reformulation of our products and may reduce or eliminate the availability of certain parts and components used in our products and services in the event our suppliers are unable to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely and costeffective manner any redesign or reformulation or restricted supply of parts and components may negatively affect the availability or performance of our products and services add testing leadtimes for products and reformulated products reduce our margins result in additional costs or have other similar effects in addition the costs to comply with these regulations may be significant any of these could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations these legal and regulatory requirements are complex and subject to change and we continue to evaluate their impact  		 		 			 		 		 			we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws and immigration and travel restrictions these legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future  		 		 			 		 		 			any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in fines penalties and sanctions product recalls suspensions or discontinuations of or limitations or restrictions on our ability to design manufacture market import export or sell our products and damage to our reputation 		 		 			 		 		 			consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business  		 		 			  		 		 			veterinarians are our primary customers for our cag products and services and the us veterinary industry has been consolidating in recent years the number of owners of veterinary hospitals has been declining and an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include mars incorporated owner of banfield pet hospitals blue pearl veterinary partners and pet partners national veterinary associates and vca inc formerly named vca antech inc in january 2017 mars incorporated and vca announced that mars incorporated agreed to acquire vca with the acquisition expected to close in the third quarter of 2017 a similar trend exists in other countries such as in the uk and the nordic countries and may in the future also develop in other international markets furthermore an increasing percentage of individuallyowned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies and there can be no assurance that hospitals that otherwise become affiliated with these companies would not shift all or a portion of their testing to such reference laboratories furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies or those that establish other affiliations with these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline  		 		 			 		 		 			our success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technologies  		 		 			  		 		 			we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights we also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of thirdparty technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license thirdparty patents and technologies on reasonable terms our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us  		 		 		 		  		 			22 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		  		 		 			we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights  		 		 			  		 		 			in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be prohibited from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			 		 		 			changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			the market for our companion animal livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence for example the demand for our bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of regulatory changes in the european union including the european unions standing committee on the food chain and animal health agreement to allow european union member states the option to eliminate bse testing of healthy cattle at slaughter in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			 		 		 			our operations and reputation may be impaired if we our products or our services do not comply with evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection  		 		 			we offer products and services that collect and use data provided by client practices and individuals including practice management systems for veterinary practices eg cornerstone and neo online client communication tools and services eg pet health network pro and cloudbased technology through vetconnect plus that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients diagnostic data from idexx inclinic analyzers our rapid assays and reference laboratories in one place some of these products and services rely on thirdparty providers for cloud storage we also engage in ecommerce through various idexx websites and collect contact and other personally identifiable information from our customers and visitors to our websites 		 		 			 federal state and international laws and regulations govern the collection use retention sharing and security of personally identifiable information including data that we receive from our employees customers vendors and visitors to our websites and data collected by our customers and others when using our products and services in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions including requiring local storage and processing of data these laws and regulations continue to develop are subject to differing interpretations and may be applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be inconsistent with our current data protection and privacy policies and practices 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			23 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		for example on october 6 2015 the court of justice of the european union decided that the euus safe harbor framework that had been in place since 2000 which allowed transfers of personal data to the us in compliance with applicable eu data protection laws was invalid  on february 2 2016 us and european commission officials announced they had agreed upon a framework for a new data sharing agreement called the euus privacy shield to replace the euus safe harbor framework the european commission and the us department of commerce issued the final text for the privacy shield framework in july 2016 and it became operational when the us department of commerce began accepting applications for privacy shield certification on august 1 2016 we submitted our selfcertification under the privacy shield in september 2016 and adopted this framework to transfer personal data to the us in compliance with eu data protection laws effective as of january 10 2017 the us department of commerce completed its review of our selfcertification and we joined the privacy shield list of participating organizations 		 		 			additionally in april 2016 the eu parliament adopted the general data protection regulation or gdpr which among other things imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance and is expected to take effect in 2018 the costs associated with compliance with these evolving legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future and as a result may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business in addition we have and post on our website our own privacy policy concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us or our products and services to protect employee or customer data including as a result of a breach by or of a thirdparty provider or to comply with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles or our posted privacy policies could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or otherwise which could have an adverse effect on our business 		 		 			 		 		 			strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business  		 		 			  		 		 			we are a global business with 39 percent of our revenue during the year ended december 31 2016 attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside of the us any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against foreign currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen australian dollar and brazilian real adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales and profits that are made in those currencies the strengthening of the us dollar has a greater adverse effect on the profits from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars that are exported to international markets and a lesser effect on profits from foreign sourced products and services due to a natural hedge from international expenses denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies for the year ended december 31 2016 approximately 21 percent of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 20 percent and 22 percent for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars as well as affect our overall competitiveness in international markets the accumulated impacts from any continued longerterm growth in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our operating results see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact 		 		 			 		 		 			our foreign currency hedging activities see note 17  hedging instruments in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements which are designed to minimize and delay but not to eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently offset the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates on our financial results over the limited time the hedges are in place in addition our hedging activities involve costs and risks such as transactions costs and the risk that our hedging counterparties will default on their obligations 		 		 			 		 		 			we primarily hedge intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and swiss franc other foreign currency exposures related to foreign sourced services and emerging markets may not be practical to hedge in certain cases these exposures are not offset by foreign currency denominated costs as we primarily use foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months and enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions on a quarterly basis for the current and following year the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activities to offset longerterm appreciation in the value of the us dollar against nonus  		 		  		 			24 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		currencies may be limited factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales and other forecasts volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments since the hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility they not only temporarily reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also temporarily reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by a strengthening value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities  		 		 			 		 		 			a weak worldwide economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk  		 		 			  		 		 			a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems these conditions if they continue could result in a decrease in sales or decrease in sales growth of diagnostic products and services which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human pointofcare diagnostic instruments economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all  		 		 			 		 		 			risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 		 		 			 		 		 			for the year ended december 31 2016 approximately 39 percent of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us compared to 39 percent for the year ended december 31 2015 and 43 percent for the year ended december 31 2014 although we intend to continue to expand our international operations and business we may not be able to successfully promote market import export sell or distribute our products and services outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including disruptions in transportation of our products fluctuations in oil prices increased border protection and restriction on travel the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport restrictions duties and licensing requirements natural disasters unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets security concerns and local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices prohibited by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations  		 		 			 		 		 			further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors or changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition foreign government regulations may restrict our ability to repatriate funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions and any repatriation of such funds to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for us our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact

that could negatively affect our operating results 		 		 			 		 		 			we sell many of our products outside of the us through distributors as a result we are dependent on these distributors to sell our products and assist us in promoting and creating a demand for our products outside the us our distributors often offer products from several different companies and certain of our distributors may carry our competitors products and promote our competitors products over our own products we have limited ability if any to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting marketing selling and supporting our products we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market sell and support our products effectively we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results in addition violations of anticorruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction failing to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the us may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position which could have a negative effect on our operating results  		 		 			 		 		 			our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market  		 		 			  		 		 			we have limited

differences include the impact of thirdparty reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market  		 		 			 		 		 			our operations are vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade

insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such

collateral underlying the securities included in our portfolio geopolitical events or other factors any adverse changes in the financial markets and resulting declines in the value of our portfolio could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 		 		 			 		 		 			if our quarterly or annual results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline  		 		 			  		 		 			our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures customer marketing and incentive programs changes in foreign currency exchange rates timing of regulatory approvals and licenses litigation and claimrelated expenditures increase in the number and type of competitors changes in competitors product offerings changes in our sales and distribution model changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall 		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			27 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			future operating results could be negatively affected by changes in tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 		 		 			  		 		 			we are subject to local state regional and federal tax laws in the us and many other international jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions the various tax rates applied to the earnings of our activities are subject to significant change our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation also we have received tax rulings from various governments that have jurisdictional authority over our operations if we are unable to meet the requirements of such agreements or if they expire or are renewed on less favorable terms the result could negatively impact our future earnings additionally the european commission has opened formal investigations into specific tax rulings granted by several countries to specific taxpayers while we believe that our rulings in the netherlands and switzerland are different than those being discussed the ultimate resolution of such activities cannot be predicted and could also have an adverse impact on future operating results see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016 included in this annual report on form 10k for more

reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we regularly assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes any reduction in these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income

and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms in addition adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing  		 		 			 		 		 			our senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior to their stated maturity dates should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior

		 		  		 			35 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			 		 		 			the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 		 		 			 		 		 			companion animal group 		 		 			 		 		 			our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management by doing so we are able to build a mutually successful partnership with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets loyal customers and expanding practice revenues 		 		 			 		 		 			cag diagnostics we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services veterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patients diagnostic results which allows them to track and evaluate trends and achieve greater medical insight  		 		 			  		 		 			the breadth and complementary nature of our diagnostic solutions also provides us scale in sales and distribution to further increase our customer reach effective january 1 2015 we transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us and did not renew our annual contracts with our us distribution partners under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and idexx vetlab consumables in the us aligning with our direct model for instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services we believe these changes will continue to strengthen customer loyalty and help support growth of our diagnostic revenues in north america 		 		 			 		 		 			our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and nonrecurring revenues revenues related to capital placements of our inclinic idexx vetlab suite of instruments and our snap pro mobile device are nonrecurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once revenues from the associated proprietary idexx vetlab consumables snap rapid assay test kits reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our idexx vetlab instruments and our snap pro mobile device are recurring in nature in that they are regularly purchased by our customers typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services our recurring revenues most prominently idexx vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales therefore the mix of recurring and nonrecurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins  		 		 			 		 		 			diagnostic capital revenue revenues related to the placement of the idexx vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes during the early stage of an instruments life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline in the early stage of an instruments life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as reagent rentals in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a longterm customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables 		 		 			 		 		 			prior to the catalyst one instrument launch during november 2014 we presold the instrument under a customer marketing program through which customers preordering a catalyst one were initially provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument under this marketing program we deferred 7 million of instrument revenue in 2014 which was fully recognized in 2015 upon delivery of the catalyst one instruments or customer election to keep the catalyst dx was received  		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			36 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			we place our catalyst chemistry analyzers through sales leases rental and other programs in addition we continue to place vettest instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales as of december 31 2016 these three chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 43000 units globally as compared to 40000 units globally in 2015 approximately 50 percent of 2016 catalyst analyzer placements were to customers that are new to idexx including customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a new or competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental recurring revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst placement at a vettest customer substitutes a catalyst consumable stream for a vettest consumable stream we have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a vettest analyzer to a catalyst analyzer due to the superior test menu capability flexibility and ease of use of the catalyst analyzers which leads to additional testing by the customer  		 		 			 		 		 			as we continue to experience growth in placements of catalyst analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of vettest analyzers and in sales of related consumables  		 		 			 		 		 			the lasercyte dx analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer which we launched in 2013 in addition we sell the procyte dx  lasercyte and vetautoread analyzers as of december 31 2016 these four hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 31000 units as compared to 29000 units in 2015 and 27000 units in 2014 a substantial portion of procyte dx analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their lasercyte analyzer to a procyte dx analyzer in 2016 approximately 50 percent of procyte placements were made at competitive accounts we also continue to place a substantial number of lasercyte dx and lasercyte instruments both new and recertified as tradeups from the vetautoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte dx analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte and vetautoread analyzers and a decrease in the associated recurring revenue stream  		 		 			 		 		 			our sedivue dx instrument which we launched in north america early in 2016 and in the uk and australia in the fourth quarter of 2016 is the first and only inclinic analyzer to provide urine sediment analysis this instrument and singleuse consumable system provides an entirely new automated and highly accurate way to automate the inhouse process of examining urine under a microscope we provide customers with sedivue dx consumables that are charged upon utilization which we refer to as payperrun as compared to other instruments where we charge upon shipment of consumables we reported total revenues of 242 million from sedivue dx instrument and payperrun sales during the year ended december 31 2016 		 		 			 		 		 			we seek to enhance the attractiveness and customer loyalty of our snap rapid assay tests by providing the snap pro mobile device which activates snap tests properly times the run captures and saves images of the results and in conjunction with ivls records invoice charges in the patient record beginning in january of 2017 with our proread software the snap pro mobile device will interpret results these features promote practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced in addition snap pro mobile device results can be shared with pet owners on the snap pro screen or in conjunction with ivls via vetconnect plus we also sell the snapshot dx which automatically reads certain snap test results and in conjunction with ivls records those results in the electronic medical record we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products  		 		 			 		 		 			prior to 2014 the snapshot dx was our primary inclinic solution for screening thyroid disease cortisol bile acids and interpreting snap rapid assay tests upon the launch of the total thyroxine t4 slide for use with our catalyst analyzers during 2015 we experienced a decline in snapshot dx placements we reported revenues of 11 million from snapshot dx placements during the year ended december 31 2016 which reflects approximately a 04 million decrease in revenue relative to the prior year we reported revenues of 15 million from snapshot dx during the year ended december 31 2015 which reflects approximately a 1 million decrease in revenue relative to the prior year we will continue to service the existing snapshot dx install base 		 		 		 		  		 			37 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			our longterm success in the continuing growth of our cag recurring diagnostic product and services is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer loyalty and retention of their recurring revenues our ability to realize price increases based on our differentiated products and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing work flows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments in addition we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis 		 		 			 		 		 			with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab station and vetconnect plus client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 		 		 			 		 		 			recurring diagnostic revenue revenues from our proprietary idexx vetlab consumable products our snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our cag diagnostics instruments are considered recurring in nature for the year ended december 31 2016 recurring diagnostic revenue which is both highly durable and profitable accounts for approximately 72 percent of our consolidated revenue 		 		 			 		 		 			our inclinic diagnostic solutions consisting of our idexx vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with boardcertified veterinary specialists and pathologists combined with the benefit of sameday or nextday turnaround times  		 		 			 		 		 			we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in idexx vetlab instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing idexx vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry hematology and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians additionally we have found that veterinarian adoption of vetconnect plus drives utilization by spurring testing across all idexx diagnostic modalities in connection with the purchase of instruments we also offer protocolbased rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers  		 		 			 		 		 			our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers based on critically important sensitivity and specificity as well as overall superior performance and ease of use by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once including the ability to utilize our snap pro mobile device we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing  		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			38 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			the expiration of a third partys us lateral flow patent in early 2015 enabled competitors to launch single use tests that competed with several of our early generation snap rapid assay products including heartworm rt fivfelv combo test feline triple parvo and giardia these companies partnered with several of our former national distributors to gain market share by competing primarily on price in the second half of 2015 we stabilized our market share on these products in part by communicating the significant superiority in test sensitivity for both our canine and feline lines over competing tests using the lateral flow platform and in part with more effective marketing and promotion programs our higher sensitivity in the detection of infectious diseases is due in part to our snap platform which is unique in using enzymelinked immunosorbent assays elisa technology test accuracy through specificity and sensitivity is a primary factor that customers value with these inhouse tests given the importance of detecting the presence of serious infectious diseases in the practice  		 		 			 		 		 			we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as idexx reference laboratories in several markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of a unique and proprietary test menu technology employed quality turnaround time customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our inclinic offerings  		 		 			 		 		 			profitability in our lab business is supported in part by our expanding business scale globally profit improvements also reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve efficiencies when possible we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference laboratory footprint new laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on our operating margin recurring reference lab revenue growth is achieved both through increased sales to existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers we believe the increased number of customer visits by our sales professionals as a result of the implementation of our alldirect sales strategy in the us and the subsequent growth in our field sales organization has led to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our inclinic diagnostic modalities in recent years recurring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers and as a result of our upfront customer loyalty programs our upfront customer loyalty programs associated with customer acquisitions provides incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services including reference laboratory services  		 		 			 		 		 			health monitoring and biological materials testing we

drinking water supplies with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers primarily consist of water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body and integrated into customers testing protocols as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for a growing number of regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe further we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate

international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instruments life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our

been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 		 		 			 		 		 			we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 		 		 			 		 		 			revenue recognition 		 		 			 		 		 			we recognize revenue when four criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured see note 2j to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 		 		 			 		 		 			multiple element arrangements meas arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the idexx vetlab suite of analyzers diagnostic imaging systems or practice management software combined with one or more of the following products extended maintenance agreements emas consumables rapid assay kits and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services practice management software is frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide delivery of our idexx vetlab instruments diagnostic imaging systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement emas consumables rapid assay kits and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services typically are delivered over future periods generally one to six years in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future  		 		 			 		 		 			we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element if available we establish the selling price of each element based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately we use thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available when these arrangements include a separatelypriced ema we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straightline basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive if there is no stated contractual price for an ema or the separately stated price is not substantive we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element 		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			42 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			when arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value when vsoe exists for all elements or by using the residual method when there is vsoe for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered element all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered we determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 		 		 			 		 		 			certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services we apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement if the future discount is significant and incremental we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement if the discount in the mea approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales that discount is not considered incremental 		 		 			 		 		 			customer programs we record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs which include enduser rebates and other volumebased incentives incentives may be provided in the form of idexx points credits or cash and are earned by end users upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods the summary of revenue reductions presented below reflects all revenue reductions recorded for the year for each particular program these amounts are presented on a net basis when applicable which accounts for any differences between estimates and actual incentives earned for the relevant customer marketing or incentive program these differences have been insignificant in all quarterly or annual periods our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows 		 		 			 		 		 			customer loyalty programs our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of idexx products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized revenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future  		 		 			 		 		 			upfront customer loyalty programs our upfront loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services our transition to an alldirect sales model in the us and the subsequent increase in competitive activity resulted in an increase in the rate of new upfront customer loyalty incentives predominantly in response to competitive offerings during the fourth quarter of 2014 and in 2015 we saw a slowing in the rate of increase for new upfront customer loyalty incentives beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continuing through 2016  		 		 			 		 		 			if a customer breaches its agreement it is required to refund all or a portion of the upfront cash or idexx points or make other repayments remedial actions or both these incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized within other current assets and other longterm assets and are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase idexx vetlab instruments diagnostic imaging systems or cornerstone practice management systems product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer we monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 impairments of customer acquisition costs were immaterial 		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			43 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			idexx instrument marketing programs our instrument marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program these arrangements are considered meas in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above revenue reductions related to instrument marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program requiring us to apply judgment to estimate future product purchases and utilization differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate these differences were not material for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 at december 31 2016 a 5 percent change in our estimate of future customer utilization would increase or reduce revenue by approximately 04 million 		 		 			 		 		 			reagent rental programs our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation we recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables we determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on relative selling prices and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customers minimum volume commitment the cost of the instrument is capitalized within property and equipment or deferred within other assets and is charged to cost of product revenue on a straightline basis over the term of the minimum purchase agreement  		 		 			 		 		 			idexx points may be applied against the purchase price of idexx products and services or applied to trade receivables due to us idexx points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs we estimate the amount of idexx points expected to expire or breakage based on historical expirations and we recognize the estimated benefit of breakage in proportion to actual redemptions of idexx points by customers on november 30 of each year unused idexx points earned before january 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate this variance was not material for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 		 		 			 		 		 			future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive in determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data collected directly from end users which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by end users via idexx smartservice differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition  		 		 			 		 		 			following is a summary of revenue reductions net recorded in connection with our customer programs for the years

portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized  		 		 			 		 		 			we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our cag operating segment our water and lpd operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 referred to herein as the technology reporting unit a substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business included in our other segment is associated with products that have been or that we expect to be licensed to third parties realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments  		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			45 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			in evaluating goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would then perform step one of the twostep impairment test otherwise no further impairment test would be required in contrast we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the twostep impairment test doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 		 		 			 		 		 			as part of our goodwill testing process we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include the results of the most recent impairment test the competitive environment the regulatory environment anticipated changes in product or labor costs revenue growth trends the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and longrange financial forecasts the longrange financial forecasts of the reporting units which are based upon managements longterm view of our markets are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 		 		 			 		 		 			in the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015 we elected to bypass the qualitative approach and instead proceeded directly to step one of the twostep impairment test to assess the fair value of all of our reporting units  		 		 			 		 		 			as part of step one of the twostep impairment test we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows we make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions in addition we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit as of our fourth quarter assessment the total aggregate fair value of the reporting units approximated the companys market capitalization valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates  		 		 			 		 		 			we maintain approximately 65 million of goodwill associated with our remaining pharmaceutical product line outlicensing arrangements and certain retained drug delivery technologies collectively pharmaceutical activities that we seek to commercialize through arrangements with third parties currently our primary support for the carrying value of this goodwill is royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property under licensing agreements that expire in 2025 there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain or increase revenues from our remaining pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test for these pharmaceutical activities indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount of this reporting unit by approximately 76 million and 117 percent of the reporting units carrying value excluding these pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount for each of our reporting units by a range of approximately 800 million to 20 billion and 260 percent to 1220 percent of the reporting units carrying value  		 		 			 		 		 			while we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value we use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlooks for our reporting units actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital derived from industry peers changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 or 2014 		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			46 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			a prolonged economic downturn in the us or internationally resulting in lower longterm growth rates and reduced longterm profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting units fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill depending on the outcome of future impairment tests an impairment of goodwill would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 		 		 			we assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a riskadjusted discount rate

to be paid based on the achievement of established objectives most commonly surrounding the retention of customers during the postcombination period we assess contingent consideration to determine if it is part of the business combination or if it should be accounted for separately from the business combination in the postcombination period contingent consideration is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved with changes in fair value recognized

			sharebased compensation 		 		 			 		 		 			our sharebased compensation programs provide for grants of stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units along with the issuance of employee stock purchase rights the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			47 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates substantially all of our options granted during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 were granted in the first quarter of each year the weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option

affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period similar to the expected term and other relevant factors higher estimated volatility increases the fair value of a stock option while lower estimated volatility has the opposite effect the total fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december 31 2016 was 133 million if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption was increased or decreased by 1 percent the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2016 would have increased or decreased by approximately 04 million and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2016 for options awarded during the same period would have increased or decreased by less than 01 million  		 		 			 		 		 			we derive the expected term assumption for stock options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected behavior with regard to option exercises the expected term is determined using a consistent method at each grant date a longer expected term assumption increases the fair value of stock option awards while a shorter expected term assumption has the opposite effect if the weighted average of the expected term was increased or decreased by one year the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2016 would have increased or decreased by approximately 12 million and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2016 for options

number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors sharebased compensation expense is adjusted annually for actual results total sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2016 was 199 million which is net of a reduction of 30 million for actual and estimated forfeitures fluctuations in our overall employee turnover rate may result in changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience and therefore could have a significant unanticipated impact

taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 		 		 			 		 		 			on a quarterly basis we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 percent of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2016 would not result in the recognition of material incremental valuation allowances 		 		 			 		 		 			for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies alternatively in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made   		 		 			 		 		 			our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax liability would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made for example an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated us state income tax rate would cause us to decrease our net deferred tax liability balance by 03 million this decrease in the net deferred liability would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted likewise a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated us state income tax rate would have the opposite effect 		 		 			 		 		 			we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 		 		 			  		 		 			we consider the majority of the operating earnings of nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us at december 31 2016 the cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were 5467 million of which approximately 3870 million was held in cash and cash equivalents no provision has been made for the payment of us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made a determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable for several reasons including the complexity of laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we operate the varying tax treatment of potential repatriation scenarios and the timing of any future repatriation for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the us we have accounted for the tax impact on a current basis

for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 188 million as of december 31 2016 and 74 million as of december 31 2015 which includes estimated interest expense and penalties the increase in net liability is primarily related to two uncertain tax positions taken during the year the first relates to our claiming certain tax deductions under a recent court case but one that the irs has vowed to appeal the second relates to certain changes we made in our transfer pricing policies to better align statutory accounting with business operations see note 12 to the consolidated

			results of operations and trends 		 		 			 		 		 			effects of certain factors on results of operations 		 		 			 		 		 			distributor purchasing and inventories when selling our products through distributors changes in distributors inventory levels can impact our reported sales and these changes may be affected by many factors which may not be directly related to underlying demand for our products by veterinary practices which are the end users therefore we believe it is important to track sales to end users in the relevant periods by our significant distributors in order to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on our reported revenue in those periods effective january 1 2015 we fully transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us however changes in prior year us distributors inventory levels impacted 2015 reported growth results in certain countries internationally we continue to sell our products through third party distributors although we are unable to obtain data for sales to end users from certain less significant nonus third party distributors we do not believe the impact of changes in these distributors inventories had or would have a material impact on our growth rates in the relevant periods following our transition to an all direct us distribution approach we anticipate that changes in distributor inventory levels will have an immaterial impact on our growth in future years 		 		 			 		 		 			where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to this as the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to this as the impact of changes in distributors inventories on growth if during the current year distributors inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors inventories would have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the current year distributors inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors inventories would have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period  		 		 			  		 		 			effective january 1 2015 we fully transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us and did not renew our existing contracts with our former key us distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014 under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and vetlab consumables in the us aligning with our direct model for instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services 		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			50 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			we incurred transition costs to implement this alldirect sales strategy in

nonrecurring expenses during the year ended december 31 2014 associated with project management and other onetime costs required to implement this new strategy further we incurred onetime transitional impacts related to the drawdown of distributor inventory in the fourth quarter of 2014 resulting in a reduction in revenue and operating profit of 25 million and 21 million respectively in such period  		 		 			 		 		 			during the three months ended december 31 2014 we began recognizing revenue on rapid assay kits and vetlab consumables upon delivery to end users in the us instead of at distribution we also began to capture additional revenue that was previously earned by our distribution partners net of other changes related to this alldirect strategy such as free nextday shipping and a new returns policy for expired product we refer to this net additional revenue as distributor margin capture this net incremental revenue allowed us to expand our sales marketing and customer support resources which we expect will drive future revenue growth and to build out our distribution capability we expect investments in these areas will scale over time based on our expected future growth rates and provide accretive benefits to operating profit also as a result of the transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us we incurred additional working capital demands including inventory costs previously borne by our distributors and incremental accounts receivable resulting from a longer elapsed time to collect our receivables 		 		 			 		 		 			currency impact for the year ended december 31 2016 approximately 21 percent of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 20 percent for the year ended december 31 2015 and 22 percent for the year ended december 31 2014 strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured or purchased in us dollars and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure additionally our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on nonus denominated revenues see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact our future income tax expense could also be affected by changes in the mix of earnings including as a result of changes in the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to currencies in countries with differing statutory tax rates see part i item 1a risk factors included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding tax impacts  		 		 			 		 		 			the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not a measure defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap otherwise referred to herein as a nongaap financial measure as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results normalized for changes in currency in addition to reported results helps improve investors ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period

negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments diagnostic imaging and practice management systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians additionally economic turmoil can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services in the us we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our cag customers although this data is a limited sample and susceptible to shortterm impacts such as weather which may affect the number of patient visits in a given period we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful longterm representation of the

on organic revenue growth organic revenue growth is a nongaap financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the twelve months ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period for the prior year net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates acquisitions and divestitures organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under managements control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends  		 		 			  		 		 			the percentage changes in revenue from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions are nongaap financial measures see the subsection above titled effects of certain factors on results of operations  currency impact for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues

diagnostic imaging systems revenue higher veterinary subscription service revenue including increases in our pet health network pro subscriber base and higher support revenue resulting from an increase in our active installed base of diagnostic imaging and practice management systems revenues from diagnostic imaging systems were higher due to the timing of revenue recognized from fewer deferred revenue placements under upfront customer loyalty programs as compared to the same period in the prior year and the recognition of previously deferred revenues these favorable factors were partially offset by fewer licensedbased cornerstone placements as we evolve to a subscriptionbased model for new practice management customer acquisitions as well as lower average unit sale prices on diagnostic imaging system placements 		 		 			 		 		 			water the increase in water revenue as compared to the same period in the prior year was attributable to all regions in which we operate most notably from strong performance in north america europe and the asiapacific region higher revenues resulted primarily from increased sales volumes and price increases of our colilert test products and related accessories used in coliform and e coli testing placements of our quantitray sealer plus instrument which we launched in june 2015 several large project orders during the first half of 2016 and to a lesser extent from higher sales volumes of our products designed to detect cryptosporidium related to an outbreak in the united kingdom beginning in mid2015 through the first half of 2016 testing volumes also benefited slightly from favorable weather trends experienced during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period of the prior year 		 		 			 		 		 			livestock poultry and dairy the increase in lpd organic revenue resulted from strong performance in emerging markets most notably resulting from higher sales volumes of swine poultry and bovine pregnancy products and services in various regions this increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of bovine testing products within western europe in large part due to the success of certain disease eradication programs in the region as well as pressure on our dairy testing business due to a decline in worldwide milk prices 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			54

discussion focuses on organic revenue growth organic revenue growth is a nongaap financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates acquisitions and divestitures organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under managements control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends  		 		 			  		 		 			the percentage changes in revenue from foreign

net effect of currency resulted from higher relative hedging gains during 2015 as compared to 2014 which more than offset the unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates additionally the increase in the gross profit percentage resulted from the expiration of certain royalties on december 31 2014 these overall favorable factors were partly offset by a less favorable product mix due primarily to higher relative instrument and accessories sales which yield lower relative margins 		 		 			 		 		 			livestock poultry and dairy gross profit for lpd decreased due to lower sales volumes and a decrease in the gross profit percentage from 63 percent to 60 percent the gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by approximately 20 basis points of foreign currency exchanges during the year ended december 31 2015 the positive net effect of currency resulted from higher relative hedging gains during 2015 as compared to 2014 which more than offset the unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the decrease in the gross profit percentage reflects lower volume efficiencies resulting from a decrease in our asiapacific region livestock testing services revenue and current year unfavorability from the absence of the onetime decrease in royalty expense which occurred during the first quarter of 2014 resulting from a settlement with a licensor of certain patents 		 		 		 		  		 			61 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			other gross profit for other decreased due to lower sales and a decrease in the gross profit percentage from 54 percent to 48 percent the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to our opti medical business including lower average unit sales prices on consumables used by our

the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily due to the absence of the impacts related to our change in us commercial strategy impacting the first quarter of 2015 the incremental cash used by accounts receivable for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily due to our transition to an alldirect strategy in the us including the establishment of accounts receivable directly with our us endusers that previously purchased from our us distribution partners which take a longer elapsed time to collect additionally accounts receivable is impacted by increasing revenues for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 relative to the prior periods including the margin capture associated with the aforementioned alldirect strategy in contrast we received the benefit of collecting the final accounts receivable from our us distribution partners during december 2014  		 		 			 		 		 			the net incremental cash provided by inventories for 2016 was primarily due to operational initiatives to optimize inventory levels following a period of inventory growth to support new products and increasing demand cash used by inventories for 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to growth in our volume commitment rental programs in international markets and relatively higher inventory levels to support new instrument and diagnostic test launches 		 		 			 		 		 			the cash provided by deferred revenue for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to cash used for the same period in 2015 was primarily due to sales under our catalyst one introductory offer that was introduced in 2014 and increased cash provided by deferred revenue during 2014 the amount of deferred revenue for 2015 and 2016 returned to typical operating levels prior to the catalyst one instrument launch during november 2014 we presold the instrument under a customer marketing program through which customers preordering a catalyst one were initially provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument under this marketing program we deferred 7 million of instrument revenue in 2014 which was fully recognized in 2015 upon delivery of the catalyst one instruments or customer election to keep the catalyst dx was received  		 		 			 		 		 			the decrease in cash provided by other assets and liabilities for the year ended december 31 2016 was the result of higher taxable income in 2015 as compared to the same period in the prior year income tax payments were lower during 2015 resulting from onetime impacts of implementing our us alldirect strategy and the benefit from the tax increase prevention act enactment late in the fourth quarter of 2014 the net incremental cash provided by other assets and liabilities for 2015 was also due to the recognition of previously deferred catalyst instrument costs under the catalyst one introductory offer during 2015 these factors were partly offset by the incremental cash used for personnelrelated accruals including higher relative payments related to employee incentive programs and higher payments for other accruals due to increases in expenses for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to 2014 		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			67

cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by

investing activities for the year ended december 31 2016 as well as the increase in cash used for the year ended december 31 2015 was due primarily to the purchase of marketable securities in 2015

december 31 2014 the increase in cash used by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was due to the issuance of senior notes in 2015 as well as a decrease in cash used to repurchase our common stock the decrease in cash used by financing activities for year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 was due to a decrease in

disclosure about market risk 		 		 			 		 		 			our market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manufacturing operations and inventory supply contracts are in the us or in us dollars but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below for the year ended december 31 2016 approximately 21 percent of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 20 percent for the year ended december 31 2015 and 22 percent for the year ended december 31 2014 the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for three of our subsidiaries located in the netherlands singapore and dubai the functional currency is the us dollar  		 		 			 		 		 			our foreign currency exchange impacts are comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and expenses 2 the impact of hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projected revenues and expenses for 2017 excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 1 percent strengthening of the us dollar would reduce revenue by approximately 7 million and operating income by approximately 3 million additionally our foreign currency hedge contracts in place as of december 31 2016 would provide incremental offsetting gains of approximately 1 million the impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have 		 		 			 		 		 			at our current foreign exchange rate assumptions we anticipate that the effect of a stronger us dollar will have an adverse effect on our operating results by decreasing our revenues operating profit and diluted earnings per share in the year ending december 31 2017 by approximately 26 million 8 million and 006 per share respectively this unfavorable impact includes foreign currency hedging activity which is expected to increase total company operating profit by approximately 3 million and diluted earnings per share by 003 in the year ending december 31 2017 the actual impact of changes in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we transact may materially differ from our expectations described above the above estimate assumes that the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies will reflect the euro at 106 the british pound at 123 the canadian dollar at 075 the australian dollar at 075 and the japanese yen at 117 to the us dollar for the full year of 2017

foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions if a hedging instrument qualifies for hedge accounting changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge  		 		  		 			72 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months  		 		 			 		 		 			our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into other foreign currency exchange contracts or foreigndenominated debt issuances to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific balance sheet exposures including net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k for details regarding eurodenominated notes that we designated as a hedge of our euro net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries 		 		 			 		 		 			our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2016 we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions as a result no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle  		 		 			 		 		 			we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with the exception of certain emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge our exposure we hedge approximately 85 percent of the estimated exposure from intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and swiss franc we have additional unhedged foreign currency exposures related to foreign services and emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchases and sales totaled 1759 million at december 31 2016 and 1761 million at december 31 2015 at december 31 2016 we had 54 million of net unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of related tax expense  		 		 			 		 		 			we have a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of 850 million with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on december 4 2020 credit facility and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date although the credit facility does not mature until december 4 2020 all individual borrowings under the terms of the credit facility have a stated term between 30 and 180 days borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2016 were 6110 million at a weightedaverage effective interest rate of 195 percent based on amounts outstanding under our credit facility as of december 31 2016 an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 percent would increase interest expense by approximately 61 million on an annualized basis  		 		 			 		 		 			during the year ended december 31 2016 we purchased marketable debt securities which are classified as availableforsale and carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet included in this annual report on form 10k the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable

estimated warranty expense for instruments sold in the current period but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for the portion of the aggregate installed base that is under warranty estimated warranty expense is based on a variety of inputs including historical instrument performance in the customers environment historical and estimated costs incurred in servicing instruments and

has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured revenue generating transactions generally fall into one of the following categories of revenue recognition 		 		 			 		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we recognize revenue from the sales of consumables rapid assay test kits and other diagnostic products when the product is delivered to the customer except as noted below  		 			 				  			 		 			 			we recognize revenue from the sales of instruments noncancelable software licenses and hardware systems upon installation and the customers acceptance of the instrument or system as we have no significant further obligations after this point in time 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed  		 			 				  			 		 			 			we recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements emas and our softwareasaservice subscriptions over the life of the contracts using the straightline method which approximates the expected timing in which applicable services are performed amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as current or longterm deferred revenue based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition  		 			 				  			 		 			 			we recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the life of the rental agreement using the straightline method amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as current or longterm deferred revenue based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 		 			 				  			 		 			 			we recognize revenue on practice management systems sales where the system includes software that is considered more than incidental either by allocating the revenue to each element of the sale based on relative fair values of the elements including postcontract support when fair value for all elements is available or by use of the residual method when only the fair value of the postcontract support is available we recognize revenue for the system upon installation and customer acceptance and recognize revenue equal to the fair value of the postcontract support over the support period 		 			 				  			 		 			 			shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue these same costs are also included in cost of product revenue 		 			 		 		 			multiple element arrangements meas arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the idexx vetlab suite of analyzers diagnostic imaging systems or practice management software combined with one or more of the following products emas consumables rapid assay kits and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services practice management software is frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide delivery of our idexx vetlab instruments diagnostic imaging systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement emas consumables rapid assay kits and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services typically are delivered over future periods generally one to six years in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future 		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			f10 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element if available we establish the selling price of each element based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately we use thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available when these arrangements include a separatelypriced ema we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straightline basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive if there is no stated contractual price for an ema or the separately stated price is not substantive we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element 		 		 			 		 		 			when arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value when vsoe exists for all elements or by using the residual method when there is vsoe for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered element all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered we determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 		 		 			 		 		 			certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services we apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement if the future discount is significant and incremental we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement if the discount in the mea approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales that discount is not considered incremental 		 		 			 		 		 			customer programs we record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs which include enduser rebates and other volumebased incentives incentives may be provided in the form of idexx points credits or cash and are earned by end users upon achieving defined volumes of purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows 		 		 			 		 		 			customer loyalty programs our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of idexx products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized revenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future 		 		 			 		 		 			upfront customer loyalty programs our upfront loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services if a customer breaches its agreement it is required to refund all or a portion of the upfront cash or idexx points or make other repayments remedial actions or both these incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized within other current assets and other longterm assets and are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase idexx vetlab instruments diagnostic imaging systems or cornerstone practice management systems product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer we monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 impairments of customer acquisition costs were immaterial 		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			f11 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		idexx instrument marketing programs our instrument marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program these arrangements are considered meas in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above revenue reductions related to instrument marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program and require us to apply judgment to estimate future product purchases and utilization differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate these differences were not material for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014  		 		 			 		 		 			reagent rental programs our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation we recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables we determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on relative selling prices and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customers minimum volume commitment the cost of the instrument is capitalized within property and equipment or other assets and is charged to cost of product revenue on a straightline basis over the term of the minimum purchase agreement 		 		 			 		 		 			idexx points may be applied against the purchase price of idexx products and services or applied to trade receivables due to us idexx points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs we estimate the amount of idexx points expected to expire or breakage based on historical expirations and we recognize the estimated benefit of breakage in proportion to actual redemptions of idexx points by customers on november 30 of each year unused idexx points earned before january 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate this variance was not material for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 		 		 			 		 		 			future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive in determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data collected directly from end users which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by end users via idexx smartservice a secure internet link that enables us to extract data and provide diagnostic service and support for certain idexx vetlab instruments through remote access differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition  		 		 			 		 		 			doubtful accounts receivable we recognize revenue when collection from the customer is reasonably assured we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for potentially uncollectible receivables we base our estimates on a detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category additional allowances may be required if either the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or a strengthening us dollar impacts the ability of foreign customers to make payments to us on their us denominated purchases account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered we do not have any offbalance sheet credit exposure related to our customers we have no significant customers that accounted for greater than 10 percent of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 similarly we have no concentration of credit risk as of december 31 2016 		 		 			 		 		 			kresearch and development costs 		 		 			 		 		 			research and development costs which consist of salaries

selfinsure costs associated with workers compensation and health and general welfare claims incurred by our us and canadian employees up to certain limits the insurance company provides insurance for claims above these limits claim liabilities are recorded for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported such liabilities are based on individual coverage the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is paid and judgments about the present and expected levels of claim frequency and severity estimated claim liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends estimated claim liabilities are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  		 		 			 		 		 			pleases  see note 14 		 		 			 		 		 			qearnings per share  see note 13 		 		 			 		 		 			rforeign currency 		 		 			 		 		 			the functional currency of all but three of our subsidiaries is their local currency assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated to the us dollar using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date revenue and expense accounts are translated to the us dollar using the exchange rate at the date which those elements are recognized and where it is impractical to do so an average exchange rate in effect during the period is used to translate those elements cumulative translation gains and losses are shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  		 		 			 		 		 			revenues and expenses denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiarys functional currency are recorded at the current exchange rate when the transaction is recognized monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiarys functional currency are remeasured at each balance sheet date using the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date these foreign currency gains and losses are included in general and administrative expenses we recognized aggregate foreign currency losses of 13 million for the year ended december 31 2016 02 million for the year ended december 31 2015 and 20 million for the year ended december 31

comprehensive income see note 19 for information about the effects on net income of significant amounts reclassified out of each component of aoci for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 we consider the foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment to be permanently invested and therefore have not provided income taxes on those amounts  		 		 			 		 		 			vconcentrations of risk 		 		 			 		 		 			financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash cash equivalents accounts receivable and derivatives to mitigate such risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents we place our cash with highlyrated financial institutions in noninterest bearing accounts that are insured by the us government and money market funds invested in government securities 		 		 			  		 		 			concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to certain customers to whom we make substantial sales to reduce risk we routinely assess the financial strength of our most significant customers and monitor the amounts owed to us taking appropriate action when necessary as a result we believe that accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts but historically have not experienced any material losses related to an individual customer or group of customers in any particular industry or geographic area  		 		 			 		 		 			to mitigate concentration of credit risk with respect to derivatives we enter into transactions with highlyrated financial institutions enter into master netting arrangements with the counterparties to our derivative transactions and frequently monitor the credit worthiness of our counterparties our master netting arrangements reduce our exposure in that they permit outstanding receivables and payables with the counterparties to our derivative transactions to be offset in the event of default we have not incurred such losses and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal 		 		 			 		 		 			inventory if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of the inventory we need to sell our products we could face cost increases or delays or discontinuations in product shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations many of the third parties that provide us with the instruments we sell and certain components raw materials and consumables used in or with our products are obtained from sole or single source suppliers some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary or complex in nature and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources  		 		 			 		 		 			wnew accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 		 		 			 		 		 			in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new standard which will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance within us gaap under the new standard an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services in doing so companies will be required to make certain judgments and estimates including identifying contract performance obligations estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price among separate performance obligations additionally the new standard requires disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts significant judgments reached in the application of the guidance and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract in july 2015 the fasb approved a oneyear deferral of the effective date to all annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 the guidance permits two methods of adoption a full retrospective method to each prior reporting period presented or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application we are continuing to evaluate the impact of this new standard while the new standard will not impact the overall economics of our products and services sold under customer incentive programs we do expect the new standard will require us to delay revenue recognition related to certain of our customer incentive programs and to accelerate  		 		  		 			f14 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		revenue recognition for certain other customer incentive programs the volume and mix of future customer incentive programs will affect our assessment of the overall net impact of the new standard on our results and will also influence our choice of adoption method we plan to determine our method of adoption and provide an estimate of any impacts by october 2017 in connection with our financial reporting for the quarter ending september 30 2017 		 		 			 		 		 			in february 2016 the fasb issued amendments to increase transparency and comparability among organizations leasing arrangements the principal difference from previous guidance is that effective upon adoption the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases will be recognized in the balance sheet for public business entities the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted in transition we are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach including the option to utilize a number of practical expedients we are in process of evaluating our lessee and lessor arrangements to determine the impact of this amendment on the consolidated financial statements this evaluation includes an extensive review of revenue through leasing arrangements as well as lease expenses which are primarily through operating lease arrangements for most of our facilities 		 		 			 		 		 			in march 2016 the fasb issued amendments which simplify several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including income tax consequences recognition of stock compensation award forfeitures classification of awards as either equity or liabilities the calculation of diluted shares outstanding and classification on the statement of cash flows the most significant change resulting from these amendments is recording all the tax effects related to sharebased payments at settlement through the income statement under existing guidance tax benefits in excess of compensation costs windfalls are recorded in equity similarly tax deficiencies below compensation costs shortfalls are recorded in equity to the extent of previous windfalls while shortfalls in excess of this are recorded to the income statement furthermore the new guidance is expected to increase the dilutive effect of sharebased payment awards as a result of no longer assuming that tax benefits are used to purchase our common stock under the treasury method the amendments also provide an alternative to estimating stock award forfeitures and instead recording at the time of forfeiture we will adopt this update beginning in the first quarter of 2017 we estimate that tax benefits related to sharebased payments will add approximately 012 to 016 in annual diluted earnings per share for 2017 primarily through a reduction in idexxs effective tax rate partially offset by an increase in diluted shares outstanding resulting from this accounting change these impacts may vary significantly by quarter based on the timing of actual settlement activity 		 		 			 		 		 			in june 2016 the fasb issued amendments that requires financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected the allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected the income statement reflects the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets as well as the increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period the measurement of expected credit losses is based upon historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount credit losses relating to availableforsale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a direct writedown to the security credit losses on availableforsale securities will be required when the amortized cost is below the fair market value during 2016 the amortized cost of our availableforsale securities was within 01 million of the fair value the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption for fiscal year beginning after december 15 2018 is permitted we will apply the standards provisions as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective reporting period this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 		 		 			 		 		 			in august 2016 the fasb issued amendments that provide guidance on the statement of cash flows presentation of certain transactions where diversity in practice exists on the classification of certain cash receipts and payment the effective date will be the first quarter of an entitys fiscal year 2019 with early adoption permitted the amendment should be adopted using a retrospective transition approach but may be applied prospectively if retrospective application would be impracticable this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			f15 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		in october 2016 the fasb issued an amendment that requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs even though the pretax effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation the amendments are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 these amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulativeeffect adjustment directly to retained earnings at the beginning of the period adopted early adoption is permitted in the first interim period of an annual reporting period for which financial statements have not been issued we are in the process of determining the impact of these amendments on our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			 		 		 			in november 2016 the fasb amended current cash flow guidance to add guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash these amendments require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginningofperiod and endofperiod total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years we do not expect the adoption of the amendments to have a material impact our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			 		 		 			in january 2017 the fasb amended business combination guidance to modify the definition of a business the amended definition of a business is an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends lower costs or other economic benefits directly to investors or other owners members or participants in order to be considered a business the three elements of inputs processes and outputs must be present in a business acquisition if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets the integrated set of assets and activities acquired is not considered a business the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted this amendment may impact the allocation of purchase price in future acquisitions depending on the structure of future acquisitions 		 		 			 		 		 			in january 2017 the fasb amended the goodwill guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test instead an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value however the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill the amendments are effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment test in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january 1 2017 we do not expect the adoption of the amendments to have a material impact our

estimate our expected stock price volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over periods that are similar to the expected terms of grants and other relevant factors we derive the expected term based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected employee behavior with regard to option exercise the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury yields for a maturity approximating the expected term calculated at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards  		 		 			 		 		 			we determine the assumptions used in the valuation of option awards as of the date of grant differences in the expected stock price volatility expected term or riskfree interest rate may necessitate distinct valuation assumptions at those grant dates as such we may use

intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized  		 		 			 		 		 			our business combinations regularly include contingent consideration arrangements that require additional consideration to be paid based on the achievement of established objectives most commonly surrounding the retention of customers during the postcombination period we assess contingent consideration to determine if it is part of the business combination or if it should be accounted for separately from the business combination in the postcombination period contingent consideration is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved with changes in fair value recognized in earnings changes in fair value of contingent consideration and differences arising upon settlement were not material during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 see note 3 for additional information regarding contingent consideration arising from recent business acquisitions 		 		 			 		 		 			we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist in evaluating goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would then perform step one of the twostep impairment test otherwise no further impairment test would be required in contrast we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the twostep impairment test doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 		 		 			 		 		 			in the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015 we elected to bypass the qualitative approach and instead proceeded directly to step one of the twostep impairment test to assess the fair value of all of our reporting units as part of step one of the twostep impairment test we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows we make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions in addition we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit changes in forecasted cash flows or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period  		 		 			 		 		 			no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 or 2014 		 		 		 		  		 			f24 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			we assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a riskadjusted discount rate  		 		 			 		 		 			during the first half of 2016 management reviewed the opti medical product offerings as a result of this review we discontinued certain development

million respectively comprise unrecognized tax positions that would if recognized affect our effective tax rate the increase in net liability is primarily related to two uncertain tax positions taken

deferred stock units outstanding during the year the computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased for the assumed exercise of dilutive options and assumed issuance of unvested restricted stock units and unvested deferred stock units using the treasury stock method unless the effect is antidilutive the treasury stock method assumes that proceeds including cash received from the exercise of employee stock options the total unrecognized compensation expense for unvested sharebased compensation awards and the excess tax benefits resulting from sharebased compensation tax deductions in excess of the related expense recognized for financial reporting purposes would be used to purchase our common stock at the average market price during the period vested deferred stock units outstanding are included in shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share because the associated shares of

benefits had this officer been terminated without cause at december 31 2016 other than following a change in control we would have had an obligation for salaries and benefits of approximately 16 million under such agreement in addition the agreement provides for continued vesting of his outstanding equity awards for a period of two years  		 		 			 		 		 			we have entered into employment agreements with each of our officers that require us to make certain payments in the event the officers employment is terminated under certain circumstances within a certain period following a change in control the amount payable by us under each of these agreements is based on the officers salary and bonus history at the time of termination and the cost to us of continuing to provide certain benefits had all of our officers been terminated in qualifying terminations following a change in control at december 31 2016 we would have had aggregate obligations of approximately 271 million under these agreements these agreements also provide for the acceleration of the vesting of all stock options and restricted stock units upon any qualifying termination following a change in control at this time we believe the likelihood of terminations as a result of the scenarios described is remote and therefore we have not accrued for such loss contingencies 		 		 			 		 		 			we have total contingent consideration liabilities outstanding of up to 64 million primarily related to the achievement of certain revenue milestones we have recorded 09 million and 59 million of contingent consideration liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively we have not accrued for 55 million of contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisition of an intangible asset in 2008 as we do not deem the achievement of associated revenue milestones to be probable of occurring as of december 31 2016  		 		 		 		  		 			f34 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			from time to time we have received notices alleging that our products infringe thirdparty proprietary rights although we are not aware of any pending litigation with respect to such claims patent litigation frequently is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any infringement proceedings that may be commenced against us if we lose any such litigation we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages as a result of the litigation 		 		 			 		 		 			guarantees 		 		 			 		 		 			we enter into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses the precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement in many cases we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically unlimited we have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved we believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal accordingly we have recorded no liabilities for these obligations at december 31 2016 and 2015 		 		 			 		 		 			when acquiring a business we sometimes assume liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition we have recorded 18 million and 14 million of probable preacquisition liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively 		 		 			 		 		 			note 15 segment reporting 		 		 			 		 		 			we operate primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as cag water quality products water and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food which we refer to as lpd our other operating segment combines and presents products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market with our pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments  		 		 			 		 		 			during the second quarter of 2016 we renamed our customer information management and diagnostic imaging systems line of business in the cag segment to veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems financial results were not adjusted as a result of this name change 		 		 			 		 		 			during the fourth quarter of 2016 we modified our management reporting to rename idexx vetlab service and accessories to cag diagnostics service and accessories and reclassified the location of snap pro service plans previously located in cag diagnostics capital  instruments to cag diagnostics service and accessories the amount of revenue reclassified was 14 million during the year ended december 31 2016 and 05 million during the year ended december 31 2015 the amount reclassified was immaterial during the year ended december 31 2014 		 		 			 		 		 			prior to january 1 2015 our cag segment included certain herd health screening services processed within our cag reference laboratories we have transitioned the responsibility for these diagnostic services from our cag segment to our lpd segment to more effectively align our business with the nature and customers of these livestock services segment revenue and income from operations for the year ended december 31 2014 has been retrospectively revised in this annual report on form 10k to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments revenue related to these livestock diagnostic services was 138 million for the year ended december 31 2014  		 		 			 		 		 			operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decisionmaker or decisionmaking group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance our chief operating decisionmaker is our chief executive officer our operating segments include cag water lpd and other assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting purposes  		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			f35 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			cag develops designs manufactures and distributes products and performs services for veterinarians and the bioresearch market primarily related to diagnostics and information management water develops designs manufactures and distributes a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological parameters in water lpd develops designs manufactures and distributes diagnostic tests and related instrumentation and performs services that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry to improve bovine reproductive efficiency and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food opti medical develops designs manufactures and distributes pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the human medical diagnostics market  		 		 			  		 		 			the accounting policies of our segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note 2 except for inventories as discussed below intersegment revenues which are not included in the table below were not material for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014  		 		 			 		 		 			certain costs are not allocated to our operating segments and are instead reported under the caption unallocated amounts these costs include costs that do not align with one of our existing operating segments or are cost prohibitive to allocate which primarily consist of our rampd function regional or country expenses certain foreign currency revaluation gains and losses on monetary balances in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currency and unusual items corporate support function costs such as information technology facilities human resources finance and legal health benefits and incentive compensation are charged to our business segments at predetermined budgeted amounts or rates differences from these predetermined budgeted amounts or rates are captured within unallocated amounts  		 		 			 		 		 			effective january 1 2016 we modified our management reporting to the chief operating decision maker to provide a more comprehensive view of the performance of our operating segments by including the capitalization and subsequent recognition of variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs which adjusts the timing of cost recognition from when the variance is created to the period in which the related inventory is sold prior to january 1 2016 the capitalization and subsequent recognition of these variances were not allocated to our operating segments and were instead reported under the caption unallocated amounts  		 		 			 		 		 			the segment income loss from operations within this annual report on form 10k for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 has been retrospectively revised to reflect the changes to our segment performance metrics described above the following is a summary of revised segment gross profit from operations for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014

value measurements 		 		 			 		 		 			us gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date us gaap requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs where available and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value  		 		 			 		 		 			we have certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities that may be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and certain financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets but for which we disclose the fair value the fair value disclosures of these assets and liabilities are based on a threelevel hierarchy which is defined as follows 		 		 			  		 		 			 				 					 						level 1 				 				 					 						quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date 				 			 			 				 					 						level 2 				 				 					 						observable inputs other than level 1 prices

are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities  				 			 		 		 			 		 		 			assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of

instruments are foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into other foreign currency exchange contracts or foreigndenominated debt issuances to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific balance sheet exposures including net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries we enter into interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with borrowings under our variablerate credit facility 		 		 			 		 		 			the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions including transactions denominated in euro british pound japanese yen canadian dollar australian dollar and swiss franc we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with wellcapitalized multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving hedging instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 		 		 			 		 		 			cash flow hedges 		 		 			 		 		 			we have designated our foreign currency exchange contracts and variabletofixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges as these derivative instruments mitigate the exposure to variability in the cash flows of forecasted transactions attributable to foreign currency exchange and interest rates unless noted otherwise we have also designated our derivative instruments as qualifying for hedge accounting treatment  		 		 			 		 		 			we did not dedesignate any instruments from hedge accounting treatment during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 gains or losses related to hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 were not material at december 31 2016 the estimated amount of net gains net of income tax expense which are expected to be reclassified out of aoci and into earnings within the next twelve months is  49 million if exchange and interest rates do not fluctuate from the levels at december 31 2016 		 		 			 		 		 			we hedge approximately 85 percent of the estimated exposure from intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and swiss franc we have additional unhedged foreign currency exposures related to foreign services and emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year as a result our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the notional value of foreign currency exchange contracts may vary throughout the year the us dollar is the currency purchased or sold in all of our foreign currency exchange contracts the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales totaled 1759 million at december 31 2016 and 1761
