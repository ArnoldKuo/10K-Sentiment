agencies that relate to among other things product approvals manufacturing distribution marketing and promotion labeling recordkeeping testing quality storage and product disposal the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses 		 		 			  		 		 			veterinary diagnostic products diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products are regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the united states department of agriculture usda animal and plant health inspection service aphis these products must be approved by aphis before they may be sold in the us the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in japan germany the netherlands and many other countries we also are required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products we have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine and our distribution center in memphis tennessee our manufacturing facility in montpellier france has been approved by aphis and we have a permit to import products manufactured in montpellier france to the us for distribution 		 		 			  		 		 			our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are veterinary medical devices regulated by the us food and drug administration fda under the food drug and cosmetics act the fdc act while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the fda and does not subject us to the fdas current good manufacturing practices regulations cgmp these products must not be adulterated mislabeled or misbranded under the fdc act 		 		 			  		 		 			these instrument systems also are subject to the european medical device directives which create a single set of medical device regulations for all european union eu member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to obtain european conformity marking for their products 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			15 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			water testing products our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is regulated by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert colilert18 colisure quantitray filtamax xpress enterolert and simplate for heterotrophic plate counts products have been approved by the epa for use under various regulatory programs water testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world 		 		 			  		 		 			dairy testing products dairy products used in national conference on interstate milk shipments ncims milkmonitoring programs in the us are regulated by the fda as veterinary medical devices however before products requiring fda approval can be sold in the us performance data must be submitted in accordance with an fdaapproved protocol administered by an independent body such as the association of analytical communities research institute aoac ri following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by ncims an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap betalactam antibiotic residue test product has been approved by the fda ncims and aoac ri for sale in the us while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 		 		 			  		 		 			human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers our opti instrument systems are classified as class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti products the fdas quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing and which are submitted as a 510k application opti medical products are also subject to the european medical device directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold 		 		 			  		 		 			in addition to the foregoing

differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those factors discussed elsewhere in this report 		 		 			  		 		 			our business lines are highly competitive and our failure to successfully execute certain strategies could have a material negative impact on our growth and profitability  		 		 			  		 		 			the companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy including  		 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			developing manufacturing and marketing innovative new or improved and cost competitive inclinic laboratory analyzers that drive sales of idexx vetlab instruments grow our installed base of instruments and increase demand for related consumable products services and accessories

products and services from those of our competitors 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of these products and the management of diagnostic information derived from our products 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			providing our veterinary customers with the medical and business tools information and resources that enable them to grow their practices through increased pet visits and enhanced practice of realtime care 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			achieving cost improvements in our worldwide network of laboratories by implementing global best practices including lean processing techniques incorporating technological enhancements including laboratory automation and a global laboratory information management system employing purchasing strategies to maximize leverage of our global scale increasing the leverage of existing infrastructure and consolidating testing in high volume laboratory hubs 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			achieving cost improvements in the manufacture and service of our inclinic laboratory analyzers by employing the benefits of economies of scale in both negotiating supply contracts and leveraging manufacturing overhead and by improving reliability of our instruments

suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			we rely on thirdparty suppliers to provide components in our products manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves including packagedelivery services because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives actions taken by them could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations the risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with thirdparty suppliers on reasonable terms inconsistent or inadequate quality control relocation of supplier facilities supplier work stoppages and suppliers failure to comply with their contractual obligations problems with suppliers could materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market substantially decrease sales lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers 		 		 			  		 		 			in addition we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include the majority of our catalyst dx and catalyst one consumables procyte dx hematology idexx vetautoread hematology vetlyte electrolyte vettest chemistry analyzers and related consumables and accessories image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems and certain components and raw materials used in our snap rapid assay kits and snap pro mobile device livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products catalyst one lasercyte and lasercyte dx hematology analyzers to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers we seek when possible to enter into longterm contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices however some suppliers decline to enter into longterm contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers we may be unable to supply the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market  		 		 			  		 		 			many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products which are products that include materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products samples and the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products and could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			18 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			our business sells many products through distributors which present risks that could negatively affect our operating results 		 		 			  		 		 			we sell many of our products outside of the us through distributors as a result we are dependent on these distributors to sell our products and assist us in promoting and creating a demand for our products outside the us our distributors often offer products from several different companies and certain of our distributors may carry our competitors products and promote our competitors products over our own products we have limited ability if any to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting marketing selling and supporting our products we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market sell and support our products effectively we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results in addition violations of anticorruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction failing to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the us may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position which could have a negative effect on our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets and new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services which could be superior to our products and services some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services similar to ours at lower sales prices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering with our transition to an alldirect sales strategy for our kits and consumables in the us effective january 1 2015 we did not renew our distribution agreements with our former key us distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014 including exclusive distribution agreements with some of the largest us distributors of companion animal veterinary products we historically sold significant amounts of our kits and consumables through our former us distribution partners and two of our previously exclusive us distribution partners joined a third former us distribution partner by beginning to carry competitive instruments consumables and rapid assay products in the fourth quarter of 2014 the promotion and sale of our competitors products by our former us distribution partners may adversely affect the retention of our customers for our kits and consumables and the sales and distribution of our products which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies also have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do  		 		 			  		 		 			various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 		 		 			  		 		 			in the us the manufacture and sale of many of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda or the epa our infectious disease diagnostic tests for animal health applications including most rapid assay canine and feline snap tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our dairy testing products require approval by the fda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa the manufacture and sale of our opti line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries in addition delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability  		 		 		 		  		 			19 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws these legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future in addition any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could result in fines penalties and sanctions suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture market or sell our products and damage to our reputation 		 		 			  		 		 			increase in corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business  		 		 			  		 		 			an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include banfield pet hospital national veterinary associates and vca antech inc a similar trend exists in other countries such as in the uk and nordic countries and may in the future also develop in other international markets furthermore an increasing percentage of individuallyowned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech inc our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline  		 		 			  		 		 			our success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technologies  		 		 			  		 		 			we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights we also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of thirdparty technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license thirdparty patents and technologies on reasonable terms our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us  		 		 			  		 		 			we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights  		 		 			  		 		 			in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be prohibited from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			20 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			the market for our companion animal livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence for example the demand for our bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of regulatory changes in the european union including the european unions standing committee on the food chain and animal health agreement to allow european union member states the option to eliminate bse testing of healthy cattle at slaughter effective march 2013 in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			our operations and reputation may be impaired if we our products or our services do not comply with regulations and policies regarding privacy and protection of user data 		 		 			  		 		 			we offer products and services that store and use practice and client information including practice management systems for veterinary practices eg cornerstone online client communication tools and services eg pet health network pro and cloudbased technology through vetconnect plus that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients diagnostic data from idexx inclinic analyzers our rapid assays and reference laboratories in one place some of these products and services rely on thirdparty providers for cloud storage we also engage in ecommerce through various idexx websites and collect contact and other personal or identifying information from our customers and visitors to our websites 		 		 			  		 		 			federal state and international laws and regulations govern the collection use retention sharing and security of personal information including data that we receive from our employees customers and visitors to our websites and data collected by our customers and others when using our products and services the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future in addition we have and post on our website our own privacy policy concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us or our products and services to protect employee or customer data including as a result of a breach by or of a thirdparty provider or to comply with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles or our posted privacy policies could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or otherwise which could have an adverse effect on our business 		 		 			  		 		 			strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business  		 		 			  		 		 			any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against nonus currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the profits on products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and exported to international markets approximately 28 of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 and 26 of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			21 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			a weak economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk  		 		 			  		 		 			a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems these conditions if they continue could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human pointofcare diagnostic instruments economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all  		 		 			  		 		 			risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 		 		 			  		 		 			for the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 43 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us compared to 42 and 41 for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively although we intend to continue to expand our international operations and business we may not be able to successfully promote market sell or distribute our products and services outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and licensing requirements natural disasters unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets security concerns and local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices prohibited by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations  		 		 			  		 		 			further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors in addition foreign government regulations may restrict our ability to repatriate funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions and any repatriation of such funds to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for us our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period  		 		 			  		 		 			our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market  		 		 			  		 		 			we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of thirdparty reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market  		 		 		 		  		 			22 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		our operations are vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters system disruptions and security breaches 		 		 			  		 		 			the operation of all of our facilities may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters interruptions in power supply or other system failures while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events  		 		 			  		 		 			we manufacture many of our significant companion animal products including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock poultry and dairy testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine certain of our companion animal products as well as our human pointofcare products are manufactured in roswell georgia we also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in bern switzerland and montpellier france in addition we maintain major distribution facilities in north america and in the netherlands and major reference laboratories in memphis tennessee leipzig germany ludwigsburg germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia markham ontario wetherby uk and tokyo japan interruption of operations at any of these facilities could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			 we rely on several information systems throughout our company to keep financial records process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions although we employ system backup measures our current disaster recovery plan may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities further our information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches including computer viruses any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen if we were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions it could result in the loss of sales and customers financial misstatement and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business furthermore any access to public disclosure of or other loss of information as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings which could damage our reputation cause a loss of confidence in our products and services and adversely affect our business 		 		 			  		 		 			we maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for the longterm competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations  		 		 			  		 		 			if our quarterly or annual results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline  		 		 			  		 		 			our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures customer marketing and incentive programs changes in foreign currency exchange rates and litigation and claimrelated expenditures increase in the number and type of competitors changes in competitors product offerings changes in our sales and distribution model changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			23 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			future operating results could be negatively affected by changes in tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 		 		 			  		 		 			we are subject to local state regional and federal tax laws in the us and many other international jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions the various tax rates applied to the earnings of our activities are subject to significant change our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation also we have received tax rulings from various governments that have jurisdictional authority over our operations if we are unable to meet the requirements of such agreements or if they expire or are renewed on less favorable terms the result could negatively impact our future earnings additionally the european commission has opened formal investigations into specific tax rulings granted by several countries to specific taxpayers while we believe that our rulings are different than those being discussed the ultimate resolution of such activities cannot be predicted and could also have an adverse impact on future operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			our income tax filings are regularly under audit by various tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we regularly assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes any reduction in these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination is made  		 		 			  		 		 			restrictions in our debt agreements or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may limit our activities 		 		 			  		 		 			our ability to make scheduled payments and satisfy our other obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility and senior notes depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative negative and financial covenants our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility and senior notes could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms in addition adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing  		 		 			  		 		 			our senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior to their stated maturity dates should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior notes the prepayment penalty we incur could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 		 		 			  		 		 			we fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility if we were unable to obtain financing on favorable terms we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability
