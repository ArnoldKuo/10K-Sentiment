caused and could continue to cause pet owners to skip or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or could affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems a decline in patient visits to the hospital in the willingness of pet owners to treat certain health conditions or approve certain tests in pet ownership in general or in the inclination of veterinarians to recommend certain tests or make capital purchases could result in a decrease in

potential negative consequence this agreement satisfies the requirements of the consent agreement that we may have exclusive distribution agreements with only two of the three largest us distributors of companion animal veterinary products the modification of our agreement with mwi will result in one or more of our competitors selling products through mwi which we expect will increase the field sales resources of mwi used by those competitors to sell their products under the modified agreement with mwi we will provide lower compensation to mwi on sales of our products since we will no longer receive the benefits of mwis exclusive focus on our products we expect to reinvest savings from this lower rate of compensation in other sales and marketing resources and the selling efforts of our other distributors we believe that the reallocation of these sales resources will help mitigate the potential effects of the loss of exclusive focus of mwi and the additional field sales resources used by our competitors however there can be no assurances that we will be able to fully mitigate the competitive effects of the changes in the nature of our agreement with mwi any reduction in the relative effectiveness of our overall selling efforts could have an adverse effect on our results of operations which we do not believe would be material  		 		 			  		 		 			our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technologies  		 		 			  		 		 			we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us  		 		 			  		 		 			we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights  		 		 			  		 		 			in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			distributor purchasing patterns could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			we sell many of our products including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us through distributors distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the enduser demand for our products in addition our agreements with us distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason on 60 days prior written notice because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors the unanticipated loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency timing or size of distributor purchases could have a negative effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies consolidation within distribution channels increases our customer concentration level which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			17 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets and new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services which could be superior to our products and services some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering similar products and services to ours at lower sales prices which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do  		 		 			  		 		 			changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			the market for our companion animal and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			effective january 1 2009 the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease in the european union was increased from 30 months to 48 months which reduced the population of cattle tested by approximately 30 in february 2011 the european unions standing committee on the food chain and animal health scfcah agreed to allow its member states to further raise the recommended testing age to 72 months effective july 1 2011 which further reduced the population of cattle tested in december 2012 the scfcah agreed to allow european union member states the option to eliminate bse testing of healthy cattle at slaughter effective march 2013 the demand for our bse testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of these regulatory changes and could be further impacted by further changes that could be made in the future revenue from bse testing products was less than 10 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2012

consortiums could negatively affect our business  		 		 			  		 		 			an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us is owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include vca antech inc national veterinary associates and banfield pet hospital each of which is currently a customer of idexx a similar trend exists in the uk and may in the future also develop in other countries furthermore an increasing percentage of individually owned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums that we believe are positive for our business decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums in particular banfield pet hospital to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations which could be material in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech inc our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally use their reference laboratory services almost exclusively and shift a large portion of their testing from inclinic testing to their reference laboratories furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline  		 		 			  		 		 			our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market  		 		 			  		 		 			we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market  		 		 			  		 		 			 risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 		 		 			  		 		 			for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 41 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us compared to 43 and 41 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively various possible risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and licensing requirements natural disasters and unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results of operations for that period  		 		 			  		 		 			our operations are vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters or system failures  		 		 			  		 		 			the operation of all of our facilities may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters interruptions in power supply or other system failures while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			19 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		we manufacture many of our significant companion animal products including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock and poultry testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine certain of our companion animal products as well as our human pointofcare products are manufactured in roswell georgia we also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in bern switzerland and montpellier france in addition we maintain major distribution facilities in north america and in the netherlands and major reference laboratories in memphis tennessee leipzig germany ludwigsburg germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia markham ontario and wetherby the united kingdom therefore interruption of operations at any of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			 we rely on several information systems throughout our company to keep financial records process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions if we were to experience a system disruption that impacts any of our critical functions it could result in the loss of sales and customers financial misstatement and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business  		 		 			  		 		 			we maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for the longterm competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations  		 		 			  		 		 			we could be subject to class action litigation due to stock price volatility which if it occurs could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us  		 		 			  		 		 			 the market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities we may be the target of similar litigation in the future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention and resources which could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition  		 		 			  		 		 			if our quarterly or annual results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline resulting in losses to you  		 		 			  		 		 			our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures marketing programs changes in foreign currency exchange rates and litigation and claimrelated expenditures changes in competitors product offerings changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall  		 		 			  		 		 			future operating results could be negatively affected by the resolution of various uncertain tax positions and by potential changes to tax incentives  		 		 			  		 		 			in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions if we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives or if they expire or are renewed at less favorable terms our inability to realize these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			20 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		restrictions in our credit facility or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may limit our activities 		 		 			  		 		 			our ability to satisfy our obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility credit facility depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative negative and financial covenants our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under the credit facility which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt and possibly on terms not deemed favorable  		 		 			  		 		 			 we fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility if we were unable to obtain financing on favorable terms we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute

			description of segments during 2012 we operated primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary and bioresearch markets which we refer to as the companion animal group cag water quality products water and products for livestock and poultry health which we refer to as livestock and poultry diagnostics lpd prior to the second quarter of 2010 we referred to our lpd segment as our production animal segment we also operate two smaller segments that comprise products for milk quality and safety dairy and products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostic market opti medical financial information about the dairy and opti medical operating segments and about a product line and outlicensing arrangements remaining from our pharmaceutical business is combined and presented in an other category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including geographic information and about our product and service categories 		 		 			  		 		 			items that are not allocated to our operating segments are as follows a portion of corporate support function and personnelrelated expenses certain manufacturing costs corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories the difference between estimated and actual sharebased compensation expense and certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses in our segment disclosure these amounts are shown under the caption unallocated amounts 		 		 			  		 		 			the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 		 		 			  		 		 			companion animal group 		 		 			  		 		 			cag offers a set of discrete products and services as described below however our strategy is to provide these products and services as integrated diagnostic and information management solutions to veterinary practices that collectively create more value for the customer than the value derived from individual products and services and that provide strong incentives for the customer to adopt full idexx solutions and to remain longterm users of our products and services the breadth and complementary nature of our products and services permit us to offer integrated diseasemanagement diagnostic solutions that leverage the advantages of both pointofcare and outside laboratory testing facilitate the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary practice and between the veterinary practice and its clients and provide us with scale in sales and distribution our objective is to provide veterinarians with the tools and services to enhance the pet owner experience with veterinary medical care while also growing veterinary practice revenues and improving staff efficiencies 		 		 			  		 		 			instruments and consumables within the idexx vetlab instrument line of business we seek to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that individually and together provide superior diagnostic information and performance features enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and improve practice efficiency and in doing so achieve their practice economic objectives including growth and profitability we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument additionally we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments 		 		 			  		 		 			during the early stage of an instruments life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline instrument sales have significantly lower gross margins than sales of consumables and therefore the mix of instrument and consumable sales in a particular period will impact our gross margins in this line of business in the early stage of an instruments life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as reagent rentals in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a longterm customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			31 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		our catalyst dx analyzer is our latest generation chemistry analyzer which was launched in 2008 we place our catalyst dx analyzer through sales leases rental and other programs in addition we continue to place vettest instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales as of december 31 2012 these two chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 33000 units  		 		 			  		 		 			a substantial portion of 2012 catalyst dx analyzer placements were to customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst dx placement at a vettest customer substitutes a catalyst dx consumable stream for a vettest consumable stream nonetheless we have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a vettest analyzer to a catalyst dx analyzer due to the superior capability and flexibility of the catalyst dx which leads to additional testing by the customer  		 		 			  		 		 			the procyte dx analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer which we launched in the third quarter of 2010 in addition we sell the lasercyte analyzer and vetautoread analyzer as of december 31 2012 these three hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 24000 units a substantial portion of procyte dx analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their lasercyte analyzer to a procyte dx analyzer however an increasing number of placements have been made at competitive accounts since the launch of this instrument in 2010 while customers continue to upgrade from their lasercyte analyzer to a procyte dx analyzer we continue to place a substantial number of lasercyte instruments both new and refurbished as tradeups from the vetautoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts in 2012 a significant number of lasercyte instruments that were placed were refurbished instruments that had been received in trade in the sale of a procyte dx analyzer as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte dx analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte and vetautoread analyzers and in sales of related consumables  		 		 			  		 		 			our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer loyalty and retention and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing workflows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results greater sample throughput broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry and hematology testing at the pointofcare for a variety of diagnostic purposes in connection with the purchase of instruments we also offer protocolbased rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers in addition we provide marketing tools and consultative services that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis 		 		 			  		 		 			with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab station client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			32 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		rapid assay products our rapid assay strategy is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate our tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers through easeofuse and superior performance including by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for multiple analytes we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing  		 		 			  		 		 			we also seek to enhance the attractiveness of our tests by providing the snapshot dx analyzer which automatically reads certain snap test results and records those results in the electronic medical record this promotes practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of the snapshot dx analyzer to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products 		 		 			  		 		 			reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories in many markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of our competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of test menu technology employed quality customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our pointofcare offerings  		 		 			  		 		 			revenue growth in this line of business is achieved both through increased sales to existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers including through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions and the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers our upfront loyalty programs have been a source of revenue growth in 2012 2011 and 2010 under these arrangements we provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services in the future  		 		 			  		 		 			in november 2011 we acquired the research and diagnostic laboratory radil business of the college of veterinary medicine from the university of missouri radil provides health monitoring and diagnostic testing services to bioresearch customers we believe the acquisition of radil allows us to leverage our expertise in veterinary diagnostics and expand our integrated offering of reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and inclinic testing solutions in an adjacent market in 2012 we began to place procyte dx analyzers containing a more advanced and research focused user interface with customers in the bioresearch market  		 		 			  		 		 			profitability of our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements startup laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services line of business 		 		 			  		 		 			 practice management and digital imaging systems and services our strategy in the practice management systems line of business is to provide superior integrated information solutions backed by superior customer support and education to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practices business objectives including superior client experience staff efficiency and practice profitability we differentiate our practice management systems through enhanced functionality ease of use and connectivity with inhouse and reference laboratory test results pet health network pro online client communication tools and services complement the entire idexx product offering by educating pet owners and building loyalty through engaging the pet owner before during and after the visit thereby driving more patient visits our strategy in digital radiography is to offer a convenient system that provides superior image quality and software capability that enables sharing of these images with clients virtually anywhere and enhanced diagnostic features and customer workflow backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in cag 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			33 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		water  		 		 			  		 		 			our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers primarily consist of water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support sales of water testing products outside of the us represented 51 of total water product sales in 2012 and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe  		 		 			  		 		 			livestock and poultry diagnostics 		 		 			  		 		 			we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests for various cattle swine and poultry diseases and conditions and have active research and development and inlicensing programs in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics with demand for tests primarily created by government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and to a lesser degree disease and reproductive management programs initiated by livestock and poultry producers disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products in addition increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products the performance of this business therefore can fluctuate in 2012 lpd revenues declined approximately 4 resulting primarily from lower sales of bovine test products due to the changes in european union testing requirements and declines in certain government programs in 2012 approximately 88 of our sales in this business were from markets outside of the us most notably europe the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally see part i item 1a risk factors 		 		 			  		 		 			other 		 		 			  		 		 			 dairy our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of milk by processors and producers and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverages almost exclusively the snap platform as well as the production equipment of our rapid assay business incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection the majority of our sales in this business are international to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penetration in the processor and producer segments of the dairy market and to develop product line enhancements and extensions in 2012 approximately 86 of our sales in this business were from markets outside of the us most notably china and europe the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally see part i item 1a risk factors 		 		 			  		 		 			opti medical systems our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals we seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instruments life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			34 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this units knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat and catalyst dx platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale  		 		 			  		 		 			in 2012 approximately 81 of our sales in the opti medical systems business were from markets outside of the us most notably europe the middleeast and asia the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally see part i item 1a risk factors 		 		 			  		 		 			critical accounting policies and estimates 		 		 			  		 		 			the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 		 		 			  		 		 			we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 		 		 			  		 		 			revenue recognition 		 		 			  		 		 			we recognize revenue when four criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured see note 2i to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 		 		 			  		 		 			multiple element arrangements meas arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the idexx vetlab suite of analyzers digital radiography systems or practice management software combined with one or more of the following products extended maintenance agreements emas consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services practice management software is frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide delivery of our idexx vetlab instruments digital radiography systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement emas consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services typically are delivered over future periods generally one to six years in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future  		 		 			  		 		 			we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element if available we establish the selling price of each element based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately we use thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available we generally determine selling price based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements when these arrangements include a separatelypriced ema we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straightline basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive if there is no stated contractual price for an ema or the separately stated price is not substantive we recognize revenue according to the mea policy stated above  		 		 		 		  		 			35 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 when arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value when vsoe exists for all elements or by using the residual method when there is vsoe for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered element all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered we determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 		 		 			  		 		 			certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services we apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement if the future discount is significant and incremental we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement if the discount in the mea approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales that discount is not considered incremental 		 		 			  		 		 			customer programs we record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs which include enduser rebates and other volumebased incentives incentives may be provided in the form of idexx points credits or cash and are earned by endusers upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows 		 		 			  		 		 			customer loyalty programs our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of idexx products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized revenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future based on applicable product inventories held by distributors at the end of the period  		 		 			  		 		 			upfront customer loyalty programs our upfront loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services if a customer breaches its agreement it is required to refund a prorated portion of the upfront cash or idexx points these incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized and recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase idexx vetlab instruments digital radiography systems or cornerstone practice management systems product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer we monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 impairments of customer acquisition costs were immaterial 		 		 			  		 		 			idexx vetlab instrument marketing programs our instrument marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program these arrangements are considered meas in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above revenue reductions related to instrument marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program and require us to apply judgment to approximate future product purchases and utilization

		 			reagent rental programs our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation we recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables we determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on vsoe and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customers minimum volume commitment the cost of the instrument is reclassified from inventory to equipment and charged to cost of product revenue on a straightline basis over the term of the rental agreement  		 		 			  		 		 			idexx points may be applied against the purchase price of idexx products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade receivables due to us idexx points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs we estimate the amount of idexx points expected to expire or breakage based on historical expirations and we recognize the estimated benefit of breakage as idexx points are issued to customers on november 30 of each year unused idexx points earned before january 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate this variance was not material for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 		 		 			  		 		 			 future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to approximate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive in determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected directly from endusers which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by endusers via idexx smartservicetm a secure internet link that enables us to extract data and provide diagnostic service and support for certain idexx vetlab instruments through remote access differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing

specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in allocating the purchase prices for acquired businesses to the fair values of the identified intangible assets and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair values of acquired net assets including intangible assets contingent consideration is included within the acquisition cost and is recognized at its fair value on acquisition date a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved changes in

may exist an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our cag operating segment our water and lpd operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 referred to herein as the technology reporting unit a substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business included in our other segment is associated with products that have been or that we expect to be licensed to third parties realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments our dairy and opti medical businesses for which there is no goodwill associated are also presented in our other segment 		 		 			  		 		 			on january 1 2012 we adopted an amendment to the accounting guidance for goodwill which simplified how companies test goodwill for impairment the amendment provides an entity the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the morelikelythannot threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount it would then perform the twostep impairment test otherwise no further impairment test would be required  		 		 			  		 		 			as part of our goodwill qualitative testing process we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit examples of the qualitative factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include the results of the most recent impairment test the competitive environment anticipated changes in product or labor costs revenue growth trends the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and longrange financial forecasts the longrange financial forecasts of the reporting units which are based upon managements longterm view of our markets are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 		 		 			  		 		 			in the fourth quarter of 2012 we elected to assess the qualitative factors discussed above and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units comprising our cag water and lpd operating segments exceeded the respective carrying amounts therefore we did not perform the twostep impairment test for these reporting units a prolonged economic downturn resulting in lower longterm growth rates and reduced longterm profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting units fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment tests in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill depending on the outcome of a qualitative assessment and if necessary the twostep impairment test an impairment of goodwill would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 		 		 			  		 		 			we did not elect to use the simplified qualitative approach to assess goodwill in our technology reporting unit due to the nature of these products that are dependent on the success of third parties to develop and commercialize therefore we performed the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows to estimate the fair value of the technology reporting unit valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates the results of the technology reporting unit goodwill impairment test indicated the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value of 7 million by approximately 160  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			39 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		while we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of our technology reporting unit are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates or the inability of third parties to successfully develop or commercialize these products could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value we use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for this reporting unit actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital wacc derived from industry peers changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of a reporting unit and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 or 2010 		 		 			  		 		 			we assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset using a riskadjusted discount rate 		 		 			as a result of recent operating losses incurred by our opti medical systems business in the human market we tested the related asset group including intangible assets for impairment in the third quarter of 2012 simultaneously we also reviewed the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets and determined that based on investments in our next generation opti analyzer it is likely we will experience a reduction in revenues from the existing products based on the acquired technologies sooner than previously estimated as a result we reduced the estimated useful lives for certain opti medical systems intangible assets resulting in increased amortization in the fourth quarter of 2012 and future periods the impact of this change in estimated useful lives is not expected to have a material impact on our future financial results  		 		 			  		 		 			we determined the future net undiscounted cash flow for our opti medical systems business in the human market which is comprised of those cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the asset group exceeded the 17 million carrying value of the related asset group including intangible assets of 5 million by approximately 60  		 		 			  		 		 			inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results approved business plans expected growth rates and tax rates many of the factors used in assessing future cash flows are outside the control of management and changes in the assumptions or estimates could materially affect the future cash flows of an asset group and therefore could affect the amount of potential future impairment of the asset in addition the performance of the business is subject to the various risks described above that are associated with our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market see part i item 1a risk factors no impairments of intangible assets were identified during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010  		 		 			  		 		 			sharebased compensation 		 		 			  		 		 			our sharebased compensation programs provide for grants of stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units along with the issuance of employee stock purchase rights the total fair value of

options the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no present intention to pay a dividend therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates however substantially all of our options granted during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were granted in the first quarter of each year the weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant

historical volatility of our stock over a period similar to the expected term and other relevant factors lower estimated volatility reduces the fair value of a stock option while higher estimated volatility has the opposite effect the total fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december 31 2012 was 80 million if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption was increased or decreased by 1 the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2012 would have increased or decreased by approximately 3 and the total expense

assumption for stock options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected behavior with regard to option exercises the expected term is determined using a consistent method at each grant date a longer expected term assumption increases the fair value of stock option awards while a shorter expected term assumption has the opposite effect if the weighted average of the expected term was increased or decreased by one year the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2012 would have increased by 10 or decreased by 11 respectively

is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which ranges from one to five years depending on the award sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards

and compensation expense is adjusted for actual results total sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2012 was 159 million which is net of a reduction of 29 million for actual and estimated forfeitures changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant unanticipated increases or decreases in sharebased compensation expense from period to period the termination of employment of certain employees who hold large numbers of sharebased compensation instruments may also have a significant

to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2012 would not result in the recognition of incremental valuation allowances 		 		 			  		 		 			for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies alternatively in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made  		 		 			  		 		 			our net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made for example an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated us state income tax rate would cause us to increase our net deferred tax asset balance by 03 million this increase in the net deferred asset would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted likewise a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated us state income tax rate would have the opposite effect 		 		 			  		 		 			we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 		 		 			  		 		 			we consider the majority of the operating earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us the cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were 3145 million at december 31 2012 of which approximately 2224 million was held in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2012 no provision has been made for us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made a determination of related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually repatriated is not practicable for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the united states we have accounted for the tax impact on a current basis 		 		 			  		 		 			we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 63 million and 56 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively which includes estimated interest expense and penalties 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			42 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		results of operations and trends 		 		 			  		 		 			effects of certain factors on results of operations 		 		 			  		 		 			distributor purchasing and inventories the instrument consumables and rapid assay products in our cag segment are sold in the us and certain other geographies by third party distributors who purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices which are the end users as a result distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and in a given period may not be directly related to underlying enduser demand for our products consequently reported results may reflect fluctuations in inventory levels held at distributors and not necessarily reflect changes in underlying enduser demand therefore we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue  		 		 			  		 		 			where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to this as the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to this as the impact of changes in distributors inventories on growth if during the current year distributors inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors inventories have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the current year distributors inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors inventories have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period  		 		 			  		 		 			at the end of a quarter we believe that our us cag distributors typically hold inventory equivalent to approximately four weeks of the anticipated enduser demand for instrument consumables and rapid assay products 		 		 			  		 		 			currency impact for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 approximately 26 26 and 25 respectively of idexx consolidated revenues were derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured in the us and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offset this exposure  		 		 			 		 		 			the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not a measure defined by us gaap otherwise referred to herein as a nonus gaap measure we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the current year period  		 		 			  		 		 			during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2011 changes in foreign

economic conditions since mid2008 in our cag segment we believe that low economic growth and relatively high unemployment have led to negative or cautious consumer sentiment which has affected the number of patient visits to veterinary clinics based on data provided by a subset of our customers that use our practice management systems we observed patient visits were flat to slightly down beginning in 2009 with a slight improvement in the growth of patient visits beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011 and further improvement during 2012 over the previous year periods although the rate of improvement has not been steady we believe that this data though limited provides a fair and meaningful representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the us that is consistent with trends in the us economic environment and consumer sentiment in contrast economic conditions in certain european countries remain challenging which continues to negatively impact our cag segment in particular  		 		 			  		 		 			we believe that the overall trend in patient visits since the beginning of the economic downturn has had a slightly negative impact on the growth rate of sales of rapid assay tests instrument consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services in addition we believe the rate of growth of sales of our instruments and digital radiography systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians has also been affected by continued caution among veterinarians regarding economic conditions weaker economic conditions since mid2008 have also caused our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services resulting in lower revenue growth due to limited price increases for certain products  		 		 			  		 		 			we also believe that current economic conditions have affected purchasing decisions of our water and lpd business customers lower water testing volumes have resulted from a decline in discretionary testing and a decline in mandated testing as a result of lower home and commercial construction fiscal difficulties in certain european countries have also reduced government funding for some water and livestock testing programs  		 		 			  		 		 			we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets have partially mitigated the effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates looking forward we are cautiously optimistic that the improvements we began to see in the us commencing in the fourth quarter of 2011 and continuing in 2012 are reflective of a gradual improvement in the macroeconomic environment that over time will further reduce these effects  		 		 			  		 		 			twelve months

organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under managements control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends  		 		 			  		 		 			 organic revenue growth and the percentage changes in revenue from currency and acquisitions are

personnelrelated costs lower legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with the us federal trade commission ftc investigation and the absence of legal and other fees incurred in connection with the uk office of fair trading oft investigation which concluded in november 2011 these favorable factors were partly offset by the absence of a payment related to the sale of certain raw material inventory in connection with the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in 2008 that was recognized during the year ended december 31 2011 we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate the estimated expense to the operating segments this allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption unallocated amounts

effective income tax rate was 316 for the year ended december 31 2012 and 310 for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase in the tax rate is primarily due to federal research and development tax credits that were not available during 2012 but were available during 2011 partly offset by higher relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates  		 		 			  		 		 			on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law which retroactively reinstated and extended the federal research and development rampd tax credit from january 1 2012 to december 31 2013 as a result the company expects its income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will reflect the entire benefit of the rampd tax credit attributable to 2012

reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under managements control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends

		 		 			the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted primarily from the impact of higher testing volumes and to a lesser extent price increases higher

margins and an overall increase in average unit sales prices driven by our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services line of business these favorable impacts were partly offset by the unfavorable impact of currency as the net favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was more than offset by the impact of increased hedging losses during the year ended december

profit for unallocated amounts decreased due primarily to the unfavorable impact of certain manufacturing costs that we do not expect to continue at this level partly offset by a decrease in certain personnelrelated costs with respect to manufacturing costs the costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period we capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with us gaap we then record these costs as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold the impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent expense recognition is reported within the caption unallocated amounts with respect to personnelrelated costs we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate the estimated expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption unallocated amounts the decrease in certain personnelrelated costs for unallocated amounts is due primarily to lower

risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manufacturing operations are in the us but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 approximately 26 26 and 25 respectively of idexx consolidated revenues were derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for one of our subsidiaries located in the netherlands the functional currency is the us dollar  		 		 			  		 		 			the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are either recognized in earnings or deferred in other comprehensive income oci net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months  		 		 			  		 		 			our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific significant transactions as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we were not hedging any specific significant transactions 		 		 			  		 		 			our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2012 we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions thus no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year which is complete by the end of the preceding year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year that are in excess of amounts previously hedged accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle  		 		 			  		 		 			we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchase and sales outstanding at december 31 2012 and 2011 was 1570 million and 1618 million respectively at december 31 2012 we had 04 million in net unrealized losses on foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments recorded in other comprehensive income which is net of less than 01 million in taxes  		 		 			  		 		 			our foreign currency exchange risk is comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and expenses 2 the impact of settled hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projected revenues and expenses for 2013 excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 10 strengthening of the us dollar would reduce operating income by

million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of 300 million with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on july 25 2016 the new credit facility is referred to as the credit facility we are subject to interest rate risk based on the terms of our credit facility to the extent that the london interbank rate libor or the canadian dollardenominated bankers acceptance rate cdor increases borrowings under our credit facility bear interest in the range from 0875 to 125 percentage points credit spread above the libor or the cdor dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio and the interest period terms for the outstanding borrowings which range from one to six months as discussed below we have entered into forward fixed interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk in future periods borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2012 were 212 million at a weightedaverage effective interest rate of 13 based on amounts outstanding and our interest rate swap effective at december 31 2012 an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 would increase interest expense by approximately 17 million on an annualized basis 		 		 			  		 		 			  in 2009 we entered into two forward fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage the economic effect of variable interest obligations under these agreements beginning on march 31 2010 the variable interest rate associated with 80 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility became effectively fixed at 2 plus the credit spread through march 30 2012 in august 2011 we entered into two additional forward fixed interest rate swap agreements for the same purpose under these agreements beginning on march 30 2012 the variable interest rate associated with 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility will become effectively fixed at 136 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 and beginning on march 28 2013 the variable interest rate associated with an additional 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility will become effectively fixed at 164 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 we have designated these swaps as qualifying instruments to be accounted for as cash flow hedges see note 17 to the consolidated

active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in allocating the purchase prices for acquired businesses to the fair values of the identified intangible assets and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair values of acquired net assets including intangible assets contingent consideration is included within the acquisition cost and is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 		 		 			  		 		 			we provide for amortization primarily using the straightline method by charges to income in

			we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist on january 1 2012 we adopted an amendment to the accounting guidance for goodwill which simplified how companies test goodwill for impairment the amendment provides an entity the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the morelikelythannot threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount it would then perform the twostep impairment test otherwise no further impairment test would be required the impact of adopting this amendment to authoritative guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows  		 		 			  		 		 			if it is determined that the first step of the goodwill impairment test is required we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions changes in forecasted cash flows or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 or 2010 		 		 			  		 		 			we assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time no impairment charges were recorded on our intangible assets other than goodwill during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 see note 8 for further information regarding our goodwill and

revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for instruments sold in the current period but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for the portion of the aggregate installed base that is under warranty estimated warranty expense is based on a variety of inputs including historical instrument performance in the customers environment historical costs incurred in servicing instruments and projected instrument reliability should actual service rates or costs differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required the liability for warranties is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets see note 10 for further information regarding our warranty reserves 		 		 			  		 		 			g income taxes  		 		 			  		 		 			we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable respectively and a deferred tax liability or asset as the case may be for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made  		 		 			  		 		 			we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes  		 		 			  		 		 			significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities any audit result differing from amounts recorded would increase or decrease income in the period that we determine such adjustment is likely interest expense and penalties associated with the underpayment of income taxes are included in income tax expense see note 12 for

management systems sales where the system includes software that is considered more than incidental either by allocating the revenue to each element of the sale based on relative fair values of the elements including postcontract support when fair value for all elements is available or by use of the residual method when only the fair value of the postcontract support is available we recognize revenue for the system upon installation and customer acceptance and recognize revenue equal to the fair value of the postcontract support over the support period 		 			 				  			 		 			 			shipping

frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide delivery of our idexx vetlab instruments digital radiography systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement emas consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services typically are delivered over future periods generally one to six years in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future 		 		 			  		 		 			we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element if available we establish the selling price of each element based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately we use thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available we generally determine selling price based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements when these arrangements include a separatelypriced ema we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straightline basis over

software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value when vsoe exists for all elements or by using the residual method when there is vsoe for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered element all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered we determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 		 		 			  		 		 			certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services we apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement if the future discount is significant and incremental we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement if the discount in the mea approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales that discount is not considered incremental 		 		 			  		 		 			customer programs we record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs which include enduser rebates and other volumebased incentives incentives may be provided in the form of idexx points credits or cash and are earned by endusers upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows 		 		 			  		 		 			customer loyalty programs our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of idexx products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized revenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future based on applicable product inventories held by distributors at the end of the period 		 		 			  		 		 			upfront customer loyalty programs our upfront loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services if a customer breaches its agreement it is required to refund a prorated portion of the upfront cash or idexx points these incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized and recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase idexx vetlab instruments digital radiography systems or cornerstone practice management systems product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer we monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of

marketing programs our instrument marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program these arrangements are considered meas in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above revenue reductions related to instrument marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program and require us to apply judgment to approximate future product purchases and utilization differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate these differences were not material for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010

receivables due to us idexx points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs we estimate the amount of points expected to expire or breakage based on historical expirations and we recognize the benefit of breakage as idexx points are issued to customers on november 30 of each year unused points earned before january 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate this variance was not material for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 		 		 			  		 		 			 future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to approximate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive in determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected directly from endusers which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by endusers via idexx smartservicetm a secure internet link that enables us to extract data and provide diagnostic service and support for certain idexx vetlab instruments through remote access differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition  		 		 			  		 		 			doubtful accounts receivable we recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is reasonably assured we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we base our estimates on a detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments additional allowances might be required account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered we do not have any

computation of basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased for the assumed exercise of dilutive options and assumed issuance of unvested restricted stock units and unvested deferred stock units using the treasury stock method unless the effect is antidilutive the treasury stock method assumes that proceeds including cash received from the exercise of employee stock options the total unrecognized compensation expense for unvested sharebased compensation awards and the excess tax benefits resulting from sharebased compensation tax deductions in excess of the related expense recognized for financial reporting purposes would be used to purchase our common stock at the average market price during the period vested deferred stock units outstanding are included in shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share because the associated shares of our common stock are issuable for no cash consideration the number of shares of our common

other comprehensive income oci net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value we dedesignate derivative instruments from hedge accounting when the likelihood of the hedged transaction occurring becomes less than probable for dedesignated instruments the gain or loss from the time of dedesignation through maturity of the instrument is recognized in earnings any gain or loss in oci at the time of dedesignation is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we enter into master netting arrangements with the counterparties to our derivative transactions which permit outstanding receivables and payables to be offset in the event of default we present our derivative assets and liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis all cash flows related to our foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are classified as operating cash flows which is

measurements 		 		 			  		 		 			us gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date us gaap requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs where available and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value  		 		 			  		 		 			the company has certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities that may be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and certain financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets but for which we disclose the fair value the fair value disclosures of these assets and liabilities are based on a threelevel hierarchy which is defined as follows 		 		 			  		 		 			 				 					 						level 1 				 				 					 						quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date 				 			 			 				 					 						level 2 				 				 					 						observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  				 			 			 				 					 						level 3 				 				 					 						unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities  				 			 		 		 			  		 		 			assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 		 		 			  		 		 			our foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets we measure the fair value of our foreign currency exchange contracts classified as derivative instruments using an income approach based on prevailing market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount the product of this calculation is then adjusted for counterparty risk we measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps classified as derivative instruments using an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve adjusted for counterparty risk

fair value of the amount outstanding under our credit facility notes receivable and longterm debt using an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market interest rates for debt issues with similar remaining years to maturity adjusted for applicable credit risk our credit facility and longterm debt are valued using level 2 inputs while our notes receivable representing a strategic investment in a privately held company with a carrying value of 46 million as of december 31 2012 is valued using level 3 inputs the results of these calculations yield fair values that approximate carrying values  		 		 			  		 		 			s comprehensive income 		 		 			  		 		 			we report all changes in equity during a period resulting from net income and transactions or

income or in two separate but consecutive statements we have chosen to retrospectively present comprehensive income which encompasses net income foreign currency translation adjustments and the difference between the cost and the fair market value of investments in debt and equity securities forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income we consider the foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment to be permanently invested and therefore have not provided income taxes on those amounts

customers to whom we make substantial sales to reduce risk we routinely assess the financial strength of our most significant customers and monitor the amounts owed to us taking appropriate action when necessary as a result we believe that accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts but historically have not experienced any material losses related to an individual customer or group of customers in any particular industry or geographic area  		 		 			  		 		 			to mitigate concentration of credit risk with respect to derivatives we enter into transactions with highlyrated financial institutions enter into master netting arrangements with the counterparties to our derivative transactions and frequently monitor the credit worthiness of our counterparties our master netting arrangements reduce our exposure in that they permit outstanding receivables and payables with the counterparties to our derivative transactions to be offset in the event of default we have not incurred such losses and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal 		 		 			  		 		 			though our longterm notes receivable are secured by certain assets

assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over periods that are similar to the expected terms of grants and other relevant factors we derive the expected term based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected employee behavior with regard to option exercise the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury yields for a maturity approximating the expected term calculated at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no present intention to pay a dividend therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards  		 		 			  		 		 			we determine the assumptions used in the valuation of option awards as of the date of grant differences in the stock price volatility expected term or riskfree interest rates may necessitate distinct valuation assumptions at those grant dates as such we may use different assumptions for options granted throughout the year the weighted averages of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option award on the date of grant and the weighted average estimated fair values were as follows

restated credit agreement relating to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of 300 million with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on july 25 2016 the new credit facility is referred to as the credit facility and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date though the credit facility does not mature until july 25 2016 all amounts borrowed under the terms of the credit facility are reflected in the current liabilities section in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because the credit facility contains a subjective material adverse event clause which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the credit facility if we fail to notify the syndicate of such an event at december 31 2012 and 2011 we had 2120 million and 2430 million respectively outstanding under our credit facility with weighted average effective interest rates of 13 and 17 respectively the funds available under the credit facility at december 31

the years 2009 through 2012 applicable interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility generally range from 0875 to 125 percentage points credit spread above the london interbank offered rate or the canadian dollardenominated bankers acceptance rate dependent on our leverage ratio or the prevailing prime rate plus a maximum spread of up to 025 dependent on our leverage ratio we have entered into forward fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage the economic effect of this variable interest obligation see note 17 for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging

federal research and development tax credits that were not available during 2012 but were available during 2011 partly offset by higher relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates  		 		 			  		 		 			our effective income tax rate was 310 for the year ended december 31 2011 and 301 for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in the tax rate was due primarily to lower tax benefits recognized related to the federal research and development tax credits lower benefits recognized in connection with the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and increased state tax 		 		 			  		 		 			we benefit from tax holidays in the netherlands and switzerland which are set to expire december 31 2015 as a result of the tax holidays our net income was higher by 60 million 53 million and 39 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the benefit from these tax holidays is reflected within the overall benefit received from international income taxes in the table above 		 		 			  		 		 			we consider the majority of the operating earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states the cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were 3145 million at december 31 2012 no provision has been made for united states federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made a determination of related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually repatriated is not practicable for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the united states we have accounted for the tax impact on a current basis 		 		 			  		 		 			the components of the net

respectively comprise unrecognized tax positions that would if recognized affect our effective tax rate the ultimate deductibility of the remaining unrecognized tax positions is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility because of the impact of deferred tax accounting other than interest and penalties the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period  		 		 			  		 		 			during each of the years ended december 31

could be greater or less than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on income tax matters or reductions of previously accrued provisions could be recorded in the future as we revise our estimates due to changing facts and circumstances or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved we are currently undergoing tax examinations by various state tax authorities and we anticipate that these examinations will be concluded within the next year we are no longer subject to us federal examinations for tax years before 2009 with few exceptions we are no longer subject to income tax examinations in any state and local or international jurisdictions in which we conduct significant taxable activities for years before 2004 		 		 			  		 		 			 at december 31 2012 we had net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and international jurisdictions of approximately 440 million available to offset future taxable income most of these net operating loss carryforwards

million respectively claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 are relatively undeveloped as of december 31 2012 therefore it is possible that we could incur additional

following a change in control at december 31 2012 we would have had aggregate obligations of approximately 207 million under these agreements these agreements also provide for the acceleration of the vesting of all stock options and restricted stock units upon any qualifying termination following a change in control at this time we believe the likelihood of terminations as a result of the

dealing or tying arrangements with distributors or endusers of those products or services the investigation  		 		 			  		 		 			on december 5 2012 we entered into an agreement containing consent

agreements with two of the following three distributors mwi veterinary supply inc mwi butler schein animal health and webster veterinary the ftc commissioners granted final approval of the consent agreement on february 11 2013 resulting in the final resolution of the investigation  		 		 			  		 		 			we continue to believe that our marketing and sales practices for companion animal veterinary

our business will not be materially adversely affected  		 		 			  		 		 			guarantees 		 		 			  		 		 			we enter into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses the precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement in many cases we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically unlimited we have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved we believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal accordingly we have recorded no liabilities for these obligations at december 31 2012 and 2011 		 		 			  		 		 			 when acquiring a business we sometimes assume liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition

			we are exposed to certain risks related to our ongoing business operations the primary risks that we manage by using derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific significant transactions we enter into interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with our variablerate debt 		 		 			  		 		 			the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 		 		 			  		 		 			cash flow hedges 		 		 			  		 		 			we have designated our foreign currency exchange contracts and variabletofixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges as these derivative instruments mitigate the exposure to variability in the cash flows of forecasted transactions attributable to foreign currency exchange and interest rates unless noted otherwise we have also designated our derivative instruments as qualifying for hedge accounting treatment  		 		 			  		 		 			we did not dedesignate any instruments from hedge accounting treatment during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 gains or

value of forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year which is complete by the end of the preceding year we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year as a result our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the notional value of foreign currency exchange contracts may vary throughout the year  		 		 			  		 		 			in march 2009 we entered into two forward fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage the economic effect of variable interest obligations on amounts borrowed under the terms of our credit facility under these agreements beginning on march 31

we entered into two additional forward fixed interest rate swap agreements for the same purpose under these agreements beginning on march 30 2012 the variable interest rate associated with 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility became effectively fixed at 136 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 and beginning on march 28 2013 the variable interest rate associated with an additional 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility will become effectively fixed at 164 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 		 		 			  		 		 			the us dollar is
