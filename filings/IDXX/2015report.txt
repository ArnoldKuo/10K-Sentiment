predictable prices however some suppliers decline to enter into longterm contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers we may be unable to supply the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market  		 		 			  		 		 			many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products which are products that include materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products samples and the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products and could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations

			we sell many of our products outside of the us through distributors as a result we are dependent on these distributors to sell our products and assist us in promoting and creating a demand for our products outside the us our distributors often offer products from several different companies and certain of our distributors may carry our competitors products and promote our competitors products over our own products we have limited ability if any to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting marketing selling and supporting our products we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market sell and support our products effectively we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results in addition violations of anticorruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction failing to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the us may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position which could have a negative effect on our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets and new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services which could be superior to our products and services some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services similar to ours at lower sales prices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering with our transition to an alldirect sales strategy for our kits and consumables in the us effective january 1 2015 we did not renew our distribution agreements with our former key us distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014 including exclusive distribution agreements with some of the largest us distributors of companion animal veterinary products we historically sold significant amounts of our kits and consumables through our former us distribution partners and two of our previously exclusive us distribution partners joined a third former us distribution partner by beginning to carry competitive instruments consumables and rapid assay products in the fourth quarter of 2014 the promotion and sale of our competitors products by our former us distribution partners may adversely affect the retention of our customers for our kits and consumables and the sales and distribution of our products which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies also have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do  		 		 			  		 		 			various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 		 		 			  		 		 			in the us the manufacture and sale of many of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda or the epa our infectious disease diagnostic tests for animal health applications including most rapid assay canine and feline snap tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our dairy testing products require approval by the fda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa the manufacture and sale of our opti line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries in addition delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability  		 		 		 		  		 			19 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws these legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future in addition any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could result in fines penalties and sanctions suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture market or sell our products and damage to our reputation 		 		 			  		 		 			increase in corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business  		 		 			  		 		 			an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include banfield pet hospital national veterinary associates and vca antech inc a similar trend exists in other countries such as in the uk and nordic countries and may in the future also develop in other international markets furthermore an increasing percentage of individuallyowned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech inc our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline  		 		 			  		 		 			our success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technologies  		 		 			  		 		 			we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights we also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of thirdparty technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license thirdparty patents and technologies on reasonable terms our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us  		 		 			  		 		 			we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights  		 		 			  		 		 			in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be prohibited from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			20 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			the market for our companion animal livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence for example the demand for our bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of regulatory changes in the european union including the european unions standing committee on the food chain and animal health agreement to allow european union member states the option to eliminate bse testing of healthy cattle at slaughter effective march 2013 in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			our operations and

the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business  		 		 			  		 		 			any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against nonus currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the profits on products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and exported to international markets approximately 28 of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 and 26 of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies a strengthening us dollar could

economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk  		 		 			  		 		 			a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems these conditions if they continue could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human pointofcare diagnostic instruments economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all  		 		 			  		 		 			risks associated with doing business internationally

repatriate funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions and any repatriation of such funds to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for us our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period  		 		 			  		 		 			our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market  		 		 			  		 		 			we have limited experience in the human

7managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 		 		 			  		 		 			description of segments prior to january 1 2013 we operated primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we continue to refer to as the companion animal group cag water quality products water and diagnostic products for livestock and poultry health which we referred to as livestock and poultry diagnostics we also operated two smaller operating segments that comprised products for milk quality and safety dairy and products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market opti medical financial information about our dairy and opti medical operating segments was combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements in an other category because they did not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments  		 		 			  		 		 			in 2013 we combined the management of our livestock and poultry diagnostics and dairy lines of business to more effectively realize the market synergies between the product lines and to achieve operational efficiencies we refer to this segment as livestock poultry and dairy lpd our opti medical operating segment remains combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements in an other category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments the segment income loss from operations discussed within this report for the year ended december 31 2012 has been retrospectively revised to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including our product and service categories and our geographic areas 		 		 			  		 		 			items that are not allocated to our operating segments are as follows a portion of corporate support function and personnelrelated expenses certain manufacturing costs corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories the difference between estimated and actual sharebased compensation expense certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses and variances from standard cost for products sold resulting from changes in certain currency exchange rates in our segment disclosure these amounts are shown under the caption unallocated amounts 		 		 			  		 		 			the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 		 		 			  		 		 			companion animal group 		 		 			  		 		 			our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management by doing so we are able to build a mutually successful partnership with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets loyal customers and expanding practice revenues 		 		 			  		 		 			cag diagnostics we refer to the extensiveness and integration of our diagnostic and information management offerings as the idexx diagnostic advantage we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratories veterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patients diagnostic results which allows them to spot trends and achieve greater medical insight  		 		 			  		 		 			the breadth and complementary nature of our diagnostic solutions also provides us scale in sales and distribution during 2013 we reorganized our companion animal diagnostic sales organization in north america transitioning our specialty sales force that represented either inclinic or outside reference laboratory diagnostics to account representatives who represent all cag diagnostic modalities in addition to this reorganization we increased the size of our sales force resulting in smaller geographically sized sales territories these changes allowed for more frequent customer contact by a consistent sales professional we have experienced accelerated revenue growth subsequently to implementing this change 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			30 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			to further increase our customer reach effective january 1 2015 we transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us and did not renew our current annual contracts with our us distribution partners under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables in the us aligning with our direct model for instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services we believe these changes will continue to strengthen customer loyalty and help support growth of our diagnostic revenues in north america 		 		 			  		 		 			our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and nonrecurring revenues revenues related to capital placements of our inclinic vetlab suite of instruments and our snap pro mobile device are nonrecurring in nature while revenues from the associated proprietary vetlab consumables snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our vetlab instruments are recurring in nature instrument sales have significantly lower gross margins than those provided by our recurring revenues especially in the case of vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits therefore the mix of nonrecurring and recurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins  		 		 			  		 		 			diagnostic capital revenue revenues related to the placement of the vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes during the early stage of an instruments life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline in the early stage of an instruments life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as reagent rentals in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a longterm customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables 		 		 			  		 		 			prior to the catalyst one instrument launch during november 2014 we presold the instrument under a customer marketing program through which customers preordering a catalyst one were initially provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument under this marketing program we deferred 7 million of instrument revenue in 2014 which will not be recognized until delivery of the catalyst one instrument occurs in 2015  		 		 			  		 		 			we place our catalyst chemistry analyzers through sales leases rental and other programs in addition we continue to place vettest instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales as of december 31 2014 these three chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 38000 units approximately half of 2014 catalyst analyzer placements were to customers that are new to idexx including customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst placement at a vettest customer substitutes a catalyst consumable stream for a vettest consumable stream we have found that the consumables revenues increase by approximately 25 when a customer upgrades from a vettest analyzer to a catalyst analyzer due to the superior capability flexibility and ease of use of the catalyst which leads to additional testing by the customer  		 		 			  		 		 			as we continue to experience growth in placements of catalyst analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of vettest analyzers and in sales of related consumables  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			31 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			the procyte dx analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer which we launched in 2010 in addition we sell the lasercyte dx and lasercyte analyzers and vetautoread analyzers as of december 31 2014 these four hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 27000 units a substantial portion of procyte dx analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their lasercyte analyzer to a procyte dx analyzer in 2014 slightly less than half of procyte placements were made at competitive accounts we also continue to place a substantial number of lasercyte dx and lasercyte instruments both new and recertified as tradeups from the vetautoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts in 2014 a significant number of lasercyte instruments that were placed were recertified instruments that had been received in trade in the sale of a procyte dx analyzer as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte dx analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte and vetautoread analyzers and in sales of related consumables  		 		 			  		 		 			we seek to enhance the attractiveness of our snap rapid assay tests by providing the snap pro mobile device which activates snap tests properly times the run captures and saves images of the results and in conjunction with ivls records invoice charges in the patient record this promotes practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced in addition snap pro mobile device results can be shared with pet owners on the snap pro screen or in conjunction with ivls via vetconnect plus we also sell the snapshot dx which automatically reads certain snap test results and in conjunction with ivls records those results in the electronic medical record we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products  		 		 			  		 		 			prior to 2014 the snapshot dx was our primary inclinic solution which screened for thyroid disease with the recent launch of the total thyroxine t4 slide for use with the catalyst one analyzer we anticipate a decline in placements of the snapshot dx although we will continue to service the existing install base 		 		 			  		 		 			our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer loyalty and retention and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing work flows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results greater sample throughput broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments in addition we provide marketing tools and consultative services that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis 		 		 			  		 		 			with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab station and vetconnect plus client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 		 		 			  		 		 			recurring diagnostic revenue revenues from our proprietary vetlab consumable products our snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our vetlab instruments are considered recurring in nature recurring diagnostic revenue accounts for approximately 71 of our consolidated revenue and is both highly durable and profitable 		 		 			  		 		 			our inclinic diagnostic solutions consisting of our vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with boardcertified veterinary specialists and pathologists combined with the benefit of sameday or nextday turnaround times  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			32 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in vetlab instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry and hematology testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians additionally we have found that veterinarian adoption of vetconnect plus drives utilization by spurring testing across all idexx diagnostic modalities in connection with the purchase of instruments we also offer protocolbased rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers  		 		 			  		 		 			our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers through easeofuse superior performance sensitivity specificity and by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing  		 		 			  		 		 			we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories in several markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of test menu technology employed quality turnaround time customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our inclinic offerings  		 		 			  		 		 			profitability from our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements when possible we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other countries expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference laboratory footprint startup laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on our operating margin recurring revenue growth is achieved both through increased sales to existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers we believe the increased number of customer visits resulting from our alldirect sales strategy in the us will lead to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our inclinic diagnostic modalities in recent years recurring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers and as a result of our upfront customer loyalty programs under these arrangements we provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services in the future  		 		 			  		 		 			health monitoring and biological materials testing we believe the acquisition of the research and diagnostic laboratory business of the college of veterinary medicine from the university of missouri allows us to leverage our expertise in veterinary diagnostics and expand our integrated offering of reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and inclinic testing solutions in the adjacent bioresearch market  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			33 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			customer information management and digital imaging systems our cornerstone practice management system provides a superior integrated information solution backed by exceptional customer support and education to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practices business objectives including a quality client experience staff efficiency and practice profitability we differentiate our practice management systems through enhanced functionality ease of use and connectivity with inclinic vetlab instruments and outside reference laboratory test results our client communication services create more meaningful pet owner experiences through personalized communication pet health network pro online client communication and education service complements the entire idexx product offering by educating pet owners and building loyalty through engaging the pet owner before during and after the visit thereby building client loyalty and driving more patient visits  		 		 			  		 		 			our digital imaging systems offer a convenient system that provides superior image quality and software capability that enables sharing of these images with clients virtually anywhere and enhanced diagnostic features and customer workflow backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in cag 		 		 			  		 		 			water  		 		 			  		 		 			our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers primarily consist of water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support sales of water testing products outside of the us represented 52 of total water product sales in 2014 and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe further we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition  		 		 			  		 		 			livestock poultry and dairy 		 		 			  		 		 			we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests for various cattle swine and poultry diseases and conditions and have active research and development and inlicensing programs in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers disease and reproductive management programs disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products in addition increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products as result the performance of this business can fluctuate 		 		 			  		 		 			our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements or dairy processor standards for testing of milk and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverages the snap platform as well as the manufacturing equipment of our rapid assay business incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penetration in dairy processors and develop product line enhancements and extensions 		 		 			  		 		 			we also distribute food safety products including randox food diagnostics a wide range of cost effective elisas sensitive and reproducible diagnostic assays for the detection of multiple compounds in one test based on a multianalyte quantitative screening drug residue analyzer called the evidence investigator our technology for food safety screening reduces the number of samples sent to confirmation laboratories lowering costs on expensive confirmation tests we believe distributing food safety products provides us opportunities at a later stage in the food value chain 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			34 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		in 2014 approximately 90 of our sales in this business were from markets outside of the us most notably europe and china the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally see part i item 1a risk factors 		 		 			  		 		 			other 		 		 			  		 		 			opti medical systems our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals we seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instruments life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments  		 		 			  		 		 			our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this units knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat and catalyst dx platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale  		 		 			  		 		 			in 2014 approximately 83 of our sales in the opti medical systems business were from markets outside of the us most notably asia and europe the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally see part i item 1a risk factors 		 		 			  		 		 			critical accounting policies and estimates 		 		 			  		 		 			the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 		 		 			  		 		 			we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 		 		 			  		 		 			revenue recognition 		 		 			  		 		 			we recognize revenue when four criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured see note 2i to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			35 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			multiple element arrangements meas arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the idexx vetlab suite of analyzers digital imaging systems or practice management software combined with one or more of the following products extended maintenance agreements emas consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services practice management software is frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide delivery of our idexx vetlab instruments digital imaging systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement emas consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services typically are delivered over future periods generally one to six years in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future  		 		 			  		 		 			we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element if available we establish the selling price of each element based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately we use thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available when these arrangements include a separatelypriced ema we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straightline basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive if there is no stated contractual price for an ema or the separately stated price is not substantive we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element 		 		 			  		 		 			when arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value when vsoe exists for all elements or by using the residual method when there is vsoe for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered element all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered we determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 		 		 			  		 		 			certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services we apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement if the future discount is significant and incremental we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement if the discount in the mea approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales that discount is not considered incremental 		 		 			  		 		 			customer programs we record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs which include enduser rebates and other volumebased incentives incentives may be provided in the form of idexx points credits or cash and are earned by end users upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods the summary of revenue reductions presented below reflects all revenue reductions recorded for the year for each particular program these amounts are presented on a net basis when applicable which accounts for any differences between estimates and actual incentives earned for the relevant customer marketing or incentive program these differences have been insignificant in all quarterly or annual periods our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			36 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			customer loyalty programs our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of idexx products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized revenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future  		 		 			  		 		 			upfront customer loyalty programs our upfront loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services if a customer breaches its agreement it is required to refund a prorated portion of the upfront cash or idexx points among other things these incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized and recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase idexx vetlab instruments digital imaging systems or cornerstone practice management systems product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer we monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 impairments of customer acquisition costs were immaterial 		 		 			  		 		 			idexx instrument marketing programs our instrument marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program these arrangements are considered meas in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above revenue reductions related to instrument marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program and require us to apply judgment to approximate future product purchases and utilization differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate these differences were not material for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 at december 31 2014 a 5 change in our estimate of future customer utilization would increase or reduce revenue by approximately 04 million 		 		 			  		 		 			reagent rental programs our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation we recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables we determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on relative selling prices and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customers minimum volume commitment the cost of the instrument is charged to cost of product revenue on a straightline basis over the term of the minimum purchase agreement  		 		 			  		 		 			idexx points may be applied against the purchase price of idexx products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade receivables due to us idexx points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs we estimate the amount of idexx points expected to expire or breakage based on historical expirations and we recognize the estimated benefit of breakage in proportion to actual redemptions of idexx points by customers on november 30 of each year unused idexx points earned before january 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate this variance was not material for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 		 		 			  		 		 			future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to approximate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive in determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected directly from end users which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by end users via idexx smartservice differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			37 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		following is a summary of

			inventory valuation 		 		 			  		 		 			we write down the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value when warranted based on assumptions of future demand market conditions remaining shelf life or product functionality if actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 		 		 			  		 		 			a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized we assess contingent consideration to determine if it is part of the  		 		  		 			38 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		business combination or if it should be accounted for separately from the business combination in the postcombination period contingent consideration is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in earnings  		 		 			  		 		 			we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our cag operating segment our water and lpd operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 referred to herein as the technology reporting unit a substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business included in our other segment is associated with products that have been or that we expect to be licensed to third parties realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments  		 		 			  		 		 			in evaluating goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the morelikelythannot threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would then perform step one of the twostep impairment test otherwise no further impairment test would be required in contrast we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the twostep impairment test doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 		 		 			  		 		 			as part of our goodwill testing process we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include the results of the most recent impairment test the competitive environment anticipated changes in product or labor costs revenue growth trends the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and longrange financial forecasts the longrange financial forecasts of the reporting units which are based upon managements longterm view of our markets are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 		 		 			  		 		 			in the fourth quarter of 2014 we elected to bypass the qualitative approach and instead proceeded directly to step one of the twostep impairment test to assess the fair value of all of our reporting units  		 		 			  		 		 			as part of step one of the twostep impairment test we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows we make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions in addition we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit as of september 30 2014 the date that we performed our assessment of goodwill for impairment the total aggregate fair value of the reporting units approximated the companys market capitalization valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates the results of our goodwill impairment test indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount for each of our reporting units by a range of approximately 120 million to 21 billion and 125 to 1063 of the reporting units carrying value 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			39 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			while we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value we use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlooks for our reporting units actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital derived from industry peers changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 or 2012 		 		 			  		 		 			a prolonged economic downturn in the us or internationally resulting in lower longterm growth rates and reduced longterm profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting units fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill depending on the outcome of future impairment tests an impairment of goodwill would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 		 		 			we assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a riskadjusted discount rate no material impairments of intangible assets were identified during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  		 		 			  		 		 			sharebased compensation 		 		 			  		 		 			our sharebased compensation programs provide for grants of stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units along with the issuance of employee stock purchase rights the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 		 		 			  		 		 			we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates substantially all of our options granted during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were granted in the first quarter of each year the weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the previous three years is as follows

volatility and the expected term of options can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period similar to the expected term and other relevant factors lower estimated volatility reduces the fair value of a stock option while higher estimated volatility has the opposite effect the total fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december 31 2014 was 107 million if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption was increased or decreased by 1 the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2014 would have increased or decreased by approximately 03 million and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2014 for options awarded during the same period would have increased or decreased by less than 01 million  		 		 			  		 		 			we derive the expected term assumption for stock options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected behavior with regard to option exercises the expected term is determined using a consistent method at each grant date a longer expected term assumption increases the fair value of stock option awards while a shorter expected term assumption has the opposite effect if the weighted average of the expected term was increased or decreased by one year the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2014 would have increased or decreased by approximately 10 million and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2014 for options awarded during 2014 would have increased or decreased by 02 million 		 		 			  		 		 			sharebased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which ranges from one to five years depending on the award sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors sharebased compensation expense is adjusted annually for actual results total sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2014 was 181 million which is net of a reduction of 32 million for actual and estimated forfeitures fluctuations in our overall employee turnover rate may result in changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience and therefore could have a significant unanticipated impact on sharebased compensation expense  		 		 			  		 		 			modifications of the terms of outstanding awards may result in significant increases or decreases in sharebased compensation there were no material modifications to the terms of outstanding options restricted stock units or deferred stock units during 2014 2013 or 2012 		 		 			  		 		 			the fair value of stock options restricted stock units deferred stock units and employee stock purchase rights issued during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 totaled 240 million 222 million and 182 million respectively the total unrecognized compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures for unvested sharebased compensation awards outstanding at december 31 2014 was 359 million which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 16 years  		 		 			  		 		 			income taxes 		 		 			  		 		 			the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 		 		 			  		 		 			on a quarterly basis we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2014 would not result in the recognition of material incremental valuation allowances 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			41 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies alternatively in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made   		 		 			  		 		 			our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax liability would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made for example an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated us state income tax rate would cause us to decrease our net deferred tax liability balance by 02 million this decrease in the net deferred liability would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted likewise a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated us state income tax rate would have the opposite effect 		 		 			  		 		 			we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 		 		 			  		 		 			we consider the majority of the operating earnings of nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us the cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were 4317 million at december 31 2014 of which approximately 3215 million was held in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2014 no provision has been made for the payment of us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made a determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the us we have accounted for the tax impact on a current basis 		 		 			  		 		 			we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 61 million and 66 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively which includes estimated interest expense and penalties 		 		 			  		 		 			results of operations and trends 		 		 			  		 		 			effects of certain factors on results of operations 		 		 			  		 		 			distributor purchasing and inventories the instrument consumables and rapid assay products in our cag segment were sold in the us and continue to be sold in certain other geographies by third party distributors who purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices which are the end users as a result distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and in a given period may not be directly related to underlying enduser demand for our products consequently reported results may reflect fluctuations in inventory levels held at distributors and not necessarily reflect changes in underlying enduser demand therefore we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			42 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to this as the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to this as the impact of changes in distributors inventories on growth if during the current year distributors inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors inventories have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the current year distributors inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors inventories have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period  		 		 			  		 		 			effective january 1 2015 we fully transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us and did not renew our existing contracts with our former key us distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014 under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables in the us aligning with our direct model for instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services 		 		 			  		 		 			we incurred transition costs to implement this alldirect sales strategy in the us including approximately 5 million in incremental expense during the year ended december 31 2014 resulting from the ramp up of sales and operating resources we also incurred 95 million in nonrecurring expenses during the year ended december 31 2014 associated with project management and other onetime costs required to implement this new strategy further we incurred onetime transitional impacts related to the drawdown of distributor inventory in the fourth quarter of 2014 resulting in a reduction in revenue and operating profit of 25 million and 21 million respectively  		 		 			  		 		 			during the three months ended december 31 2014 we began recognizing revenue on rapid assay kits and instrument consumables upon delivery to end users in the us instead of at distribution we continue to expect to capture an additional 50 million to 55 million in annual revenue on these direct sales we estimate that annual operating profit associated with this incremental revenue stream will increase approximately 5 million to 8 million in 2015 and will continue to provide accretive benefits that will scale over time based on our expected future growth rates also as a result of the transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us we anticipate increased working capital demands of approximately 15 million to 20 million including inventory costs previously held by our distributors and incremental accounts receivable resulting from a potentially longer elapsed time to collect our receivables 		 		 			  		 		 			currency impact approximately 28 of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 and 26 of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured in the us and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure additionally our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on nonus denominated revenues see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact  		 		 			  		 		 			the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not a measure defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap otherwise referred to herein as a nongaap financial measure as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results normalized for changes in currency in addition to reported results helps improve investors ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			43 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			effective january 1 2014 we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period prior to january 1 2014 we calculated this impact by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the current year period this change in methodology which was implemented to achieve operational efficiencies has not had a material impact on organic revenue growth see the subsection below titled results of operations for the definition of and other information regarding organic revenue growth 		 		 			  		 		 			during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2013 changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total company revenue by approximately 83 million due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar australian dollar and japanese yen partly offset by a weakening of the us dollar against the british pound 		 		 			  		 		 			during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2012 changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total company revenue by approximately 95 million due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the japanese yen and the australian dollar 		 		 			  		 		 			effects of economic conditions demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment including slow economic growth high unemployment and credit availability negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments digital radiography and practice management systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians additionally economic turmoil can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our cag customers although limited and susceptible to shortterm impacts such as weather we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful longterm representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the us providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services we believe the overall trends in patient visits and capital investments since the beginning of the economic downturn in 2008 have had a slightly negative impact on our cag segment revenue growth rates although the rate of growth has not been steady we have seen an improvement in growth of patient visits since the beginning of 2012  		 		 			  		 		 			economic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our water and lpd business customers in the past water testing volumes have been susceptible to declines in discretionary testing and in mandated testing as a result of decreases in home and commercial construction fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and livestock testing programs 		 		 			  		 		 			we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets partially mitigate the effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates 		 		 			  		 		 			effects of patent expiration although the company had and will have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties expire during 2014 and 2015 the expiration of these patents or licenses individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the companys financial position or future operations due to a range of factors including our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace the breadth quality and integration of our product offerings our existing customer relationships and our customer support our sales force the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies andor additional patents and our significant knowhow scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings

following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth organic revenue growth is a nongaap financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 as compared to the same period for the prior year net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under managements control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends  		 		 			  		 		 			the percentage changes in revenue from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions are nongaap financial measures see the subsection above titled effects of certain factors on results of operations  currency impact for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in

diagnostics recurring revenue was due primarily to increased volumes and higher realized prices in both our reference laboratory diagnostic services and our vetlab consumables the drawdown of inventory held by distributors as a result of our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourth quarter of 2014 reduced reported cag diagnostics recurring revenue by 3  		 		 			  		 		 			vetlab consumables revenue growth was due primarily to higher unit volumes the increase in unit volumes resulted primarily from growth of our installed base of catalyst and procyte dx instruments as a result of new customer acquisitions as well as an increase in testing from existing customers including those who upgraded to these instruments additionally vetlab consumables revenue benefited from higher average unit sales prices resulting from price increases these favorable impacts were partly offset by lower consumables volumes from our vettest chemistry instrument as customers continue to upgrade from our vettest instrument to our catalyst instruments the drawdown of inventory held by distributors resulting from our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourth quarter of 2014 reduced reported consumables revenue growth by 5  		 		 			  		 		 			vetlab service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our

		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			the decrease in cag diagnostics capital instruments revenue was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of deferred revenue associated with preorders for our catalyst one analyzer which we launched during the fourth quarter of 2014 and the impact of lower realized prices under our catalyst one introductory offer customers are provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument through the catalyst one delivery date as a result we do not recognize instrument revenue for preorders relating to the catalyst one introductory offer until the catalyst one is delivered these unfavorable impacts were partly offset by higher placements of our catalyst dx and procyte dx instruments primarily in europe and the asiapacific region and placements of our snap pro mobile device in north america for the year ended december 31 2014 the majority of snap pro mobile device placements were made under a reagent rental program for which instrument revenue will be recognized with the future sale of consumables 		 		 			  		 		 			the increase in customer information management and digital imaging systems revenue was due primarily to a growing pet health network pro subscriber base higher support revenue resulting from an increase in our installed base of digital imaging and practice management systems and higher revenue from hardware

to higher sales of certain bovine test products in the asiapacific region higher volumes in europe of our milkbased bovine pregnancy test and higher sales of poultry tests in europe and latin america lower european bovine volumes are expected to reduce revenue by less than 5 million for the year ending december 31 2015 the acquisition of a brazilian distributor of our lpd products in the third quarter of 2013 added 4 to reported revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the prior year 		 		 			  		 		 			other the increase in other revenue was due primarily to higher milestone revenue from our pharmaceutical outlicensing arrangements earned during the year ended december 31 2014 and higher sales volumes associated with our opti medical consumables and

related to the deferral of intercompany profits that were included in prior year tax provisions in error which is not material to current or prior interim or annual periods and the resolution of domestic and international tax audits which resulted in a net reduction in our provision for uncertain tax positions these favorable factors were partly offset by a reduction in the benefit from the

useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under managements control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends  		 		 			  		 		 			the

reference laboratory operations 		 		 			  		 		 			water gross profit for water increased due primarily to higher sales the gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year as the unfavorable impact of currency was mostly offset by higher average unit sales prices the unfavorable impact of currency was due primarily to hedging losses during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to hedging gains during the prior year 		 		 			  		 		 			livestock poultry and dairy gross profit for lpd decreased due to a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 55 from 59 partly offset by higher sales the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher overall manufacturing costs and the unfavorable impact of currency higher manufacturing costs were due primarily to an increase in materials costs and lower production volumes in certain product lines the unfavorable impact of currency was due primarily to hedging losses during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to hedging gains during the prior year  		 		 			  		 		 			other gross profit for other increased due to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 50 from 42 due primarily to lower overall opti medical manufacturing costs resulting from a reduction in materials costs and higher relative sales of consumables used with our opti medical instruments and milestone and royalty revenue earned from our remaining pharmaceutical outlicensing arrangements both of which yield higher relative margins 		 		 			  		 		 			unallocated amounts gross profit for unallocated amounts increased due primarily to changes in certain currency exchange rates and a decrease in certain manufacturing costs partly offset by an increase in personnelrelated costs  		 		 			  		 		 			in certain geographies where we maintain inventories in currencies other than the us dollar the product costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold which is stated at the budgeted currency exchange rate from the beginning of the fiscal year in these geographies the variances from standard cost for products sold related to changes in currency exchange rates are reported within the caption unallocated amounts for the year ended december 31 2013 these variances were due primarily to the cost of products sold in japanese yen 		 		 			  		 		 			the manufacturing costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period we capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with us gaap we then record these variances as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold the impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent recognition is reported within the caption unallocated amounts the decrease in certain manufacturing costs is due primarily to the recognition of previously favorable capitalized variances  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			54 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate the estimated expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption unallocated amounts the increase in personnelrelated costs for unallocated amounts is due primarily to higher selfinsured healthcare costs during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to

company partly offset by lower legal and other professional fees incurred as a result of the resolution of the ftc investigation in february 2013 and proceeds received during 2013 in connection with the demutualization of an insurance provider in march 2013 the freight service company provided notice to us that all freight payment services would cease immediately and that certain amounts paid by

to the research and development rampd tax credit for the year ended december 31 2012 the us legislation authorizing the rampd tax credit had expired and no associated tax benefit was recognized within this period on january 2 2013 us federal legislation was enacted that retroactively allowed an rampd tax credit for all of 2012 and extended the rampd tax credit through the year ending december 31 2013 because the related legislation was enacted in 2013 the full benefit of the rampd tax credit related to the prior years activities was recognized in 2013 in addition higher relative earnings

resulting from the tax increase prevention act that was enacted late in the year and the deferred cost of catalyst instrument placements under our catalyst one introductory offer launched in the first quarter of 2014 the tax increase prevention act retroactively extended the rampd tax credit and bonus depreciation and reduced our income taxes due related to the year ended december 31 2014 the increase in cash provided by accrued liabilities during the year ended december 31 2014 was greater than the prior year due primarily to the timing of income tax payments higher accruals related to employee incentive programs contingent consideration related to business combinations and accrued interest related to higher borrowings under our senior notes at december 31 2014 as compared to the

as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 are relatively undeveloped as of december 31 2014 therefore it is possible that we could

			  		 		 			our market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manufacturing operations and inventory supply contracts are in the us but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below approximately 28 of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 and 26 of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for two of our subsidiaries located in the netherlands and singapore the functional currency is the us dollar  		 		 			  		 		 			the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions if a derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months  		 		 			  		 		 			our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific significant transactions as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we were not hedging any specific significant transactions 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			62 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2014 we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions as a result no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle  		 		 			  		 		 			we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchases and sales totaled 1867 million and 1683 million at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively at december 31 2014 we had 81 million of net unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax expense  		 		 			  		 		 			our foreign currency exchange risk is comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and expenses 2 the impact of settled hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projected revenues and expenses for 2015 excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 10 strengthening of the us dollar would reduce operating income by approximately 9 million the impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have 		 		 			  		 		 			in june 2014 we refinanced our existing 4500 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of 700 million with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on june 18 2019 we are subject to interest rate risk based on the terms of the credit facility to the extent that the london interbank rate libor or the canadian dollardenominated bankers acceptance rate cdor increases borrowings under the credit facility bear interest in the range from 0875 to 1375 percentage points credit spread above the libor or the cdor dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio and the interest period terms for the outstanding borrowings which range from one to six months as discussed below we have entered into forward fixed interest rate swaps to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk in future periods borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2014 were 549 million at a weightedaverage effective interest rate of 15 based on amounts outstanding and our interest rate swap effective at december 31 2014 an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 would increase interest expense by approximately 47 million on an annualized basis 		 		 			  		 		 			beginning on march 30 2012 the variable interest rate associated with 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility became effectively fixed at 136 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 beginning on march 28 2013 the variable interest rate associated with an additional 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility became effectively fixed at 164 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 we have designated these swaps as qualifying instruments to be accounted for as cash flow hedges at december 31 2014 we had 07 million in unrealized losses net of income tax benefit on interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a

based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized we assess contingent consideration to determine if it is part of the business combination or if it should be accounted for separately from the business combination in the postcombination period contingent consideration is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in earnings 		 		 			  		 		 			we provide for amortization primarily using the straightline method by charges to income in amounts that allocate

may exist in evaluating goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the morelikelythannot threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would then perform step one of the twostep impairment test otherwise no further impairment test would be required in contrast we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the twostep impairment test doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 		 		 			  		 		 			in the fourth quarter of 2014 we elected to bypass the qualitative approach and instead proceeded directly to step one of the twostep impairment test to assess the fair value of all of our reporting units as part of step one of the twostep impairment test we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows we make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions in addition we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit changes in forecasted cash flows or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period

events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a riskadjusted discount rate no material impairments of our intangible assets were identified

including identifying contract performance obligations estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price among separate performance obligations additionally the amendment requires disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts significant judgments reached in the application of the guidance and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract effective for the company beginning on january 1 2017 the amendment allows for two methods of adoption a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application early adoption is not permitted we are in the process of determining the method of adoption and the impact of this amendment on our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			  		 		 			in august 2014 the fasb issued an amendment that requires management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in us auditing standards the amendments in

rights employee stock purchase rights and other stock unit awards other stock unit awards include restricted stock units rsus and deferred stock units dsus stock options permit a holder to buy idexx stock upon vesting at the stocks price on the date the option was granted an rsu is an agreement to issue shares of idexx stock at the time of vesting dsus are granted under our executive deferred compensation plan the executive plan and nonemployee director deferred compensation plan the director plan dsus may or may not have vesting conditions depending on the plan under which they are issued we did not issue any restricted stock or stock appreciation rights during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 nor were any restricted stock or stock appreciation rights outstanding as of those years ended there were no material modifications to the terms of outstanding options rsus or dsus during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 or 2012 		 		 			  		 		 			we primarily issue shares of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises and employee stock purchase rights and to settle rsus and dsus we issue shares of treasury stock to settle certain restricted stock units and upon the exercise of certain stock options the number of shares of treasury stock issued during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 was not material the number of shares of common stock and treasury stock issued are equivalent to the number of awards exercised or settled 		 		 			  		 		 			with the exception of employee stock purchase rights equity awards are issued to employees and nonemployee directors under the 2009 stock incentive plan the 2009 stock plan our board of directors has authorized the issuance of 9950000 shares of our common stock under this sharebased incentive plan any shares that are subject to awards of stock options or stock appreciation rights will be counted against the share limit as one share for every share granted any shares that are issued other than stock options and stock appreciation rights will be counted against the share limit as two shares for every share granted if any shares issued under our prior plans are forfeited settled for cash or expire these shares to the extent of such forfeiture cash settlement or expiration will again be available for issuance under the 2009 stock plan as of december 31 2014 there were 6578907 remaining shares available for issuance under the 2009 stock plan  		 		 			  		 		 			employee stock purchase rights are issued under the 1997 employee stock purchase plan under which we reserved and may issue up to an aggregate of 1590000 shares of common stock in periodic offerings under this plan stock is sold to employees at a 15 discount off the closing price of the stock on the last day of each

the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited we use historical data and other factors to estimate employee termination behavior and to evaluate whether particular groups of employees have significantly different forfeiture behaviors  		 		 			  		 		 			the total unrecognized compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures for unvested sharebased compensation awards at december 31 2014 was 359 million which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 16 years 		 		 			  		 		 			stock options 		 		 			  		 		 			option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant options granted to employees primarily vest ratably over five years on each anniversary of the date of grant and options granted to nonemployee directors vest fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant vesting of option awards issued is conditional based on continuous service options granted after may 8 2013 have a contractual term of ten years options granted between january 1 2006 and may 8 2013 have contractual terms of seven years and options granted prior to january 1 2006 have contractual terms of ten years upon any change in control of the company 25 of the unvested stock options then outstanding will vest and become exercisable however if the acquiring entity does not assume outstanding options then all options will vest immediately prior to the change in control 		 		 			  		 		 			we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over periods that are similar to the expected terms of grants and other relevant factors we derive the expected term based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected employee behavior with regard to option exercise the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury yields for a maturity approximating the expected term calculated at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			f22 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			we determine the assumptions used in the valuation of option awards as of the date of grant differences in the expected stock price volatility expected term or riskfree interest rate may necessitate distinct valuation assumptions at those grant dates as such we may use different assumptions for options granted throughout the year the weighted averages of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option award on the date of grant and the weighted average estimated fair values were as follows

related to higher relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates a nonrecurring benefit related to the deferral of intercompany profits that were included

that retroactively allowed an rampd tax credit for all of 2012 and extended the rampd tax credit through the year ended december 31 2013 because the related legislation was enacted in 2013 the full

the remaining unrecognized tax positions is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility because of the impact of deferred tax accounting other than interest and

qualifying termination following a change in control at this time we believe the likelihood of terminations as a result of the scenarios described is remote and therefore we have not accrued for such loss contingencies 		 		 			  		 		 			we have total contingent liabilities outstanding of up to 118 million primarily related to the achievement of certain revenue milestones we have recorded 63 million of contingent commitments on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2014 the amount of contingent consideration recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2013 was not material we have not accrued for 55 million of contingent liabilities related to the acquisition of an intangible asset in 2008 as we do not deem the achievement of associated revenue milestones to be probable of occurring as of december 31 2014  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			f33 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		from time to time we have received notices alleging that our products infringe thirdparty proprietary rights although we are not aware of any pending litigation with respect to such claims patent litigation frequently is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any infringement proceedings that may be commenced against us if we lose any such litigation we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages as a result of the litigation 		 		 			  		 		 			guarantees 		 		 			  		 		 			we enter into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses the precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement in many cases we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically unlimited we have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved we believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal accordingly we have recorded no liabilities for these obligations at december 31 2014 and 2013 		 		 			  		 		 			when acquiring a business we sometimes assume liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition we have recorded 25 million and 31 million of probable preacquisition liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 		 		 			  		 		 			note 14 segment reporting 		 		 			  		 		 			prior to january 1 2013 we operated primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we continue to refer to as cag water quality products water and diagnostic products for livestock and poultry health which we referred to as livestock and poultry diagnostics we also operated two smaller operating segments that comprised products for milk quality and safety dairy and products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market opti medical financial information about our dairy and opti medical operating segments was combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements in an other category because they did not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments  		 		 			  		 		 			in 2013 we combined the management of our livestock and poultry diagnostics and dairy lines of business into our lpd segment to more effectively realize the market synergies between the product lines and to achieve operational efficiencies our opti medical operating segment remains combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements in an other category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments the segment income loss from operations discussed within this report for the years ended december 31 2012 has been retrospectively revised to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments  		 		 			  		 		 			operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decisionmaker or decisionmaking group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance our chief operating decisionmaker is our chief executive officer our operating segments include cag water lpd and other assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting purposes  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			f34

market  		 		 			  		 		 			the accounting policies of our segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note 2 except for inventories as discussed below intersegment revenues which are not included in the table below were not material for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 		 		 			  		 		 			items that are not allocated to our operating segments are as follows a portion of corporate support function and personnelrelated expenses certain manufacturing costs corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories the difference between estimated and actual sharebased compensation expense and certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses these amounts are shown under the caption unallocated amounts 		 		 			  		 		 			we estimate our sharebased compensation expense corporate support function expenses and certain personnelrelated costs and allocate the estimated expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption unallocated amounts  		 		 			  		 		 			with respect to manufacturing costs the costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period we capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with us gaap we then record these variances as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold the impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent recognition is reported within the caption unallocated amounts  		 		 			  		 		 			additionally in certain geographies where we maintain inventories in currencies other than the us dollar the product costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold which is stated at the budgeted currency exchange rate from the beginning of the fiscal year in these geographies the variances from standard cost for products sold related to changes in currency exchange rates are reported within the caption unallocated amounts

derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific significant transactions we enter into interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with our variablerate credit facility 		 		 			  		 		 			the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions including transactions denominated in euro british pound japanese yen canadian dollar australian dollar and swiss franc we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 		 		 			  		 		 			cash flow hedges 		 		 			  		 		 			we have designated our foreign currency exchange contracts and variabletofixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges as these derivative instruments mitigate

value of forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year as a result our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the notional value of foreign currency exchange contracts may vary throughout the year the us dollar is the currency purchased or sold in all of our foreign currency exchange contracts the notional amount of
