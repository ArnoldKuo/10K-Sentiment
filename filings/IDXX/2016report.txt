assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could require us to incur expenses associated with

technologies when patents protecting such existing technologies expire new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services which could be superior to our products and services some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services similar to ours at lower sales prices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering with our transition to an alldirect sales strategy for our kits and consumables in the us effective january 1 2015 we did not renew

of companion animal veterinary products we historically sold significant amounts of our kits and consumables through our former us distribution partners and two of our previously exclusive us distribution partners joined a third former us distribution partner by beginning to carry competitive instruments consumables and rapid assay products in the fourth quarter of 2014 the promotion and sale of our competitors products by our former us distribution partners may adversely affect the retention of our customers for our kits and consumables and the sales and distribution of our products

industry has been consolidating in recent years the number of owners of veterinary hospitals has been declining and an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include mars petcare owner of banfield pet hospitals and blue pearl veterinary partners national veterinary associates and vca antech inc a similar trend exists in other countries such as in the uk and nordic countries and may in the future also develop in other international markets furthermore an increasing percentage of individuallyowned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech inc our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies or those that establish other affiliations with these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline

our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			the market for our companion animal livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence for example the demand for our bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of regulatory changes in the european union including the european unions standing committee on the food chain and animal health agreement to allow european union member states the option to eliminate bse testing of healthy cattle at slaughter in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits

during the year ended december 31 2015 attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside of the us any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against foreign currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen australian dollar and brazilian real adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales and profits that are made in those currencies the strengthening of the us dollar has a greater adverse effect on the profits from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars that are exported to international markets and a lesser effect on profits from foreign sourced products and services due to a natural hedge from international expenses denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies for the year ended december 31 2015 approximately 25 of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 28 and 26 for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars as well as affect our overall competitiveness in international markets the accumulated impacts from any continued longerterm growth in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 		 		 			  		 		 			our foreign currency hedging activities see note 17  hedging instruments in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements which are designed to minimize and delay but not to eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently offset the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates on our financial results over the limited time the hedges are in place we primarily hedge intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and swiss franc other foreign currency exposures related to foreign sourced services and emerging markets may not be practical to hedge in certain cases these exposures are not offset by foreign currency denominated costs as we primarily use foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months and enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions on a quarterly basis for the current and following year the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activities to offset longerterm appreciation in the value of the us dollar against nonus currencies may be limited factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales and other forecasts volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments since the hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility they not only temporarily reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also temporarily reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by a strengthening value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities  		 		 			  		 		 			during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the prior year changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our revenues by approximately 897 million due primarily to the strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against all major foreign currencies in which we conduct business additionally our operating profit and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2015 were reduced by 212 million and 016 per share respectively which are net of offsetting gains of 209 million and 016 per share respectively from our foreign currency hedging activities  		 		 			  		 		 			at our current foreign exchange rate assumptions we anticipate that the effect of a stronger us dollar will have a material adverse effect on our operating results by decreasing our revenues operating profit and diluted earnings per share in the year ending december 31 2016 by approximately 40 million 31 million and 026 per share respectively this unfavorable impact is net of offsetting foreign currency hedging gains which are expected to increase total company operating profit by 8 million and diluted earnings per share by 006 in the year ending december 31 2016 the actual impact of changes in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we transact may materially differ from our expectations described above the above estimate assumes that the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies will reflect the euro at 107 the british pound at 141 the canadian dollar at 068 the australian dollar at 068 and the japanese yen at 118 to the us dollar for the full year of 2016 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			22 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			a weak worldwide economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk  		 		 			  		 		 			a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the

veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital

consolidated balance sheets on a trade date basis see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our marketable securities 		 		 			2 between december 2013 and june 2015 we issued and sold approximately 600 million in senior notes through private placements at fixed interest rates ranging from 1785 to 404 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our senior notes  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			31 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			item 7managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 		 		 			  		 		 			description of segments we operate primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as the companion animal group cag water quality products water and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food which we refer to as livestock poultry and dairy lpd our other operating segment combines and presents products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market opti medical with our pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including our product and service categories and our geographic areas 		 		 			  		 		 			prior to january 1 2015 our cag segment included certain livestock testing services processed within our cag reference laboratories we have transitioned the responsibility for these diagnostic services from our cag segment to our lpd segment to more effectively align our business with the nature and customers of these livestock services segment revenue and income from operations for years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 have been retrospectively revised in this annual report on form 10k to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments revenue related to these livestock diagnostic services was 138 million and 99 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively for the year ended december 31 2014 this reclassification of revenue between segments increases our lpd organic revenue growth as compared to previously reported numbers by 29 and decreases our cag cag diagnostic recurring and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services organic revenue growth rates as compared to previously reported numbers by 03 04 and 08 respectively see the subsection below titled results of operations for a description of the calculation of organic revenue growth 		 		 			  		 		 			certain costs are not allocated to our operating segments and are instead reported under the caption unallocated amounts our business segments generally have limited control over the timing and amount of these expenses the major categories of these costs include  		 		 			  		 		 			gross profit 		 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			the capitalization of variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs to adjust the timing of expense recognition from when the variance is created to the period in which the related inventory is sold 		 			  		 		 			operating expenses 		 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			costs that do not align with one of our existing operating segments or are cost prohibitive to allocate primarily our rampd function regional or country expenses and certain foreign currency revaluation gainslosses on monetary balances in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currency 		 			 				  			 		 			 			corporate support function costs such as information technology facilities human resources finance and legal health benefits and incentive compensation which are charged to our business segments at predetermined budgeted amounts or rates differences from predetermined budgeted amounts or rates are captured within our unallocated segment 		 			 				  			 		 			 			unusual or extraordinary items  		 			  		 		 			the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 		 		 		 		  		 			32 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			companion animal group 		 		 			  		 		 			our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management by doing so we are able to build a mutually successful partnership with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets loyal customers and expanding practice revenues 		 		 			  		 		 			cag diagnostics we refer to the extensiveness and integration of our diagnostic and information management offerings as the idexx diagnostic advantage we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratories veterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patients diagnostic results which allows them to spot trends and achieve greater medical insight  		 		 			  		 		 			the breadth and complementary nature of our diagnostic solutions also provides us scale in sales and distribution to further increase our customer reach effective january 1 2015 we transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us and did not renew our current annual contracts with our us distribution partners under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables in the us aligning with our direct model for instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services we believe these changes will continue to strengthen customer loyalty and help support growth of our diagnostic revenues in north america 		 		 			  		 		 			our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and nonrecurring revenues revenues related to capital placements of our inclinic idexx vetlab suite of instruments and our snap pro mobile device are nonrecurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once revenues from the associated proprietary idexx vetlab consumables snap rapid assay test kits reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our idexx vetlab instruments and our snap pro mobile device are recurring in nature in that they are regularly purchased by our customers typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services our recurring revenues most prominently idexx vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales therefore the mix of recurring and nonrecurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins  		 		 			  		 		 			diagnostic capital revenue revenues related to the placement of the vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes during the early stage of an instruments life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline in the early stage of an instruments life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as reagent rentals in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a longterm customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables 		 		 			  		 		 			prior to the catalyst one instrument launch during november 2014 we presold the instrument under a customer marketing program through which customers preordering a catalyst one were initially provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument under this marketing program we deferred 7 million of instrument revenue in 2014 which was fully recognized in 2015 upon delivery of the catalyst one instruments or customer election to keep the catalyst dx was received  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			33 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			we place our catalyst chemistry analyzers through sales leases rental and other programs in addition we continue to place vettest instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales as of december 31 2015 these three chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 40000 units globally almost half of 2015 catalyst analyzer placements were to customers that are new to idexx including customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a new or competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental recurring revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst placement at a vettest customer substitutes a catalyst consumable stream for a vettest consumable stream we have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a vettest analyzer to a catalyst analyzer due to the superior test menu capability flexibility and ease of use of the catalyst analyzers which leads to additional testing by the customer  		 		 			  		 		 			as we continue to experience growth in placements of catalyst analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of vettest analyzers and in sales of related consumables  		 		 			  		 		 			the procyte dx analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer which we launched in 2010 in addition we sell the lasercyte dx and lasercyte analyzers and vetautoread analyzers as of december 31 2015 these four hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 29000 units a substantial portion of procyte dx analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their lasercyte analyzer to a procyte dx analyzer in 2015 nearly half of procyte placements were made at competitive accounts we also continue to place a substantial number of lasercyte dx and lasercyte instruments both new and recertified as tradeups from the vetautoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts in 2015 a significant number of lasercyte instruments that were placed were recertified instruments that had been received in trade in the sale of a procyte dx analyzer as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte dx analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte and vetautoread analyzers and in sales of recurring revenue stream  		 		 			  		 		 			our sedivue instrument which we plan to launch in north america early in 2016 is the first and only inclinic analyzer to provide urine sediment analysis this instrument and singleuse consumable system provides an entirely new automated and highly accurate way to automate the inhouse process of examining urine under a microscope we anticipate reported revenues of approximately 20 million in 2016 resulting from sedivue instrument placements and the resulting recurring revenue stream 		 		 			  		 		 			we seek to enhance the attractiveness of our snap rapid assay tests by providing the snap pro mobile device which activates snap tests properly times the run captures and saves images of the results and in conjunction with ivls records invoice charges in the patient record this promotes practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced in addition snap pro mobile device results can be shared with pet owners on the snap pro screen or in conjunction with ivls via vetconnect plus we also sell the snapshot dx which automatically reads certain snap test results and in conjunction with ivls records those results in the electronic medical record we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products  		 		 			  		 		 			prior to 2014 the snapshot dx was our primary inclinic solution which screened for thyroid disease upon the launch of the total thyroxine t4 slide for use with our catalyst analyzers during 2015 we experienced a decline in snapshot dx placements we reported revenues of 15 million from snapshot dx during the year ended december 31 2015 which reflects approximately a 1 million decrease in revenue relative to prior year we will continue to service the existing snapshot dx install base 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			34 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer loyalty and retention of their recurring revenues and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing work flows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results greater sample throughput broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments in addition we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis 		 		 			  		 		 			with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab station and vetconnect plus client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 		 		 			  		 		 			recurring diagnostic revenue revenues from our proprietary vetlab consumable products our snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our vetlab instruments are considered recurring in nature recurring diagnostic revenue accounts for approximately 72 of our consolidated revenue and is both highly durable and profitable 		 		 			  		 		 			our inclinic diagnostic solutions consisting of our vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with boardcertified veterinary specialists and pathologists combined with the benefit of sameday or nextday turnaround times  		 		 			  		 		 			we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in vetlab instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry hematology and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians additionally we have found that veterinarian adoption of vetconnect plus drives utilization by spurring testing across all idexx diagnostic modalities in connection with the purchase of instruments we also offer protocolbased rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers  		 		 			  		 		 			our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers through easeofuse superior performance sensitivity specificity and by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			35 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			the expiration of a third partys us lateral flow patent in early 2015 enabled competitors to launch single use tests that competed with several of our early generation snap rapid assay products including heartworm rt fivfelv combo test feline triple parvo and giardia these companies partnered with several of our former national distributors to gain market share by competing primarily on price in the second half of the year we stabilized our market share on these products in part by communicating the significant superiority in test sensitivity for both our canine and feline lines over competing tests using the lateral flow platform and in part with more effective marketing and promotion programs our higher sensitivity in the detection of infectious diseases is due in part to our snap platform which is unique in using elisa technology test accuracy through specificity and sensitivity is a primary factor that customers value with these inhouse tests given the importance of detecting the presence of serious infectious diseases in the practice  		 		 			  		 		 			we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories in several markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of test menu technology employed quality turnaround time customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our inclinic offerings  		 		 			  		 		 			profitability in our lab business is supported by our expanding business scale globally profit improvements reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve efficiencies when possible we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference laboratory footprint startup laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on our operating margin recurring revenue growth is achieved both through increased sales to existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers we believe the increased number of customer visits resulting from our alldirect sales strategy in the us will lead to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our inclinic diagnostic modalities in recent years recurring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers and as a result of our upfront customer loyalty programs under these arrangements we provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services  		 		 			  		 		 			health monitoring and biological materials testing we believe the acquisition of the research and diagnostic laboratory business of the college of veterinary medicine from the university of missouri allows us to leverage our expertise in veterinary diagnostics and expand our integrated offering of reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and inclinic testing solutions in the adjacent bioresearch market  		 		 			  		 		 			customer information management and diagnostic imaging systems our portfolio of practice management offerings is designed to serve the full range of customers within the north american australian and european markets cornerstone dvmax animana and neo practice management systems provide superior integrated information solution backed by exceptional customer support and education these practice management systems allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practices business objectives including a quality client experience staff efficiency and practice profitability we market cornerstone dvmax and neo to customers primarily in north america and australia we market animana to customers primarily throughout europe 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			36 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			animana and neo are subscriptionbased saas practice management offerings designed to provide flexible pricing and a durable recurring revenue stream while we continue to sell and support cornerstone and dvmax software we anticipate that demand for neo our subscriptionbased saas practice management offering will moderate future revenue growth from new licensedbased cornerstone placements as we evolve to a subscriptionbased model for new customer acquisitions of idexx practice management systems we believe that once established this subscriptionbased model will provide higher profitability as compared to the historical licensebased placements our cornerstone and dvmax customer base continues to be an important driver of growth through enhanced diagnostic integrations and high value addon subscription services such as pet health network pro petly plans and credit card processing and we continue to make investments to enhance the customer experience of our licensedbased offerings 		 		 			  		 		 			we differentiate our practice management systems through enhanced functionality ease of use and connectivity with inclinic vetlab instruments and outside reference laboratory test results our client communication services create more meaningful pet owner experiences through personalized communication pet health network pro online client communication and education service complements the entire idexx product offering by educating pet owners and building loyalty through engaging the pet owner before during and after the visit thereby building client loyalty and driving more patient visits  		 		 			  		 		 			our diagnostic imaging systems offer a convenient diagnostic imaging solution that provides superior image quality and software capability that enables sharing of these images with clients virtually anywhere and enhanced diagnostic features and customer workflow backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in cag 		 		 			  		 		 			water  		 		 			  		 		 			our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers primarily consist of water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support sales of water testing products outside of the us represented 50 of total water product sales in 2015 and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe further we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition  		 		 			  		 		 			livestock poultry and dairy 		 		 			  		 		 			we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests and perform services for various livestock diseases and conditions and have active research and development and inlicensing programs in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers disease and reproductive management programs disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products in addition increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products as result the performance of this business can fluctuate 		 		 			  		 		 			our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements or dairy processor standards for testing of milk and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverages the snap platform as well as the manufacturing equipment of our rapid assay business incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penetration in dairy processors and develop product line enhancements and extensions 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			37

and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals we seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instruments life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments  		 		 			  		 		 			our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this units knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat and catalyst platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale  		 		 			  		 		 			in 2015 approximately 84 of our sales in the opti medical systems business were from markets outside of the us most notably asia and europe the

policies and estimates 		 		 			  		 		 			the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 		 		 			  		 		 			we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 		 		 			  		 		 			revenue recognition 		 		 			  		 		 			we recognize revenue when four criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured see note 2j to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			38 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		multiple element arrangements meas arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the idexx vetlab suite of analyzers diagnostic imaging systems or practice management software combined with one or more of the following products extended maintenance agreements emas consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services practice management software is frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide delivery of our idexx vetlab instruments diagnostic imaging systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement emas consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services typically are delivered over future periods generally one to six years in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future  		 		 			  		 		 			we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element if available we establish the selling price of each element based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately we use thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available when these arrangements include a separatelypriced ema we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straightline basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive if there is no stated contractual price for an ema or the separately stated price is not substantive we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element 		 		 			  		 		 			when arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value when vsoe exists for all elements or by using the residual method when there is vsoe for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered element all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered we determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 		 		 			  		 		 			certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services we apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement if the future discount is significant and incremental we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement if the discount in the mea approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales that discount is not considered incremental 		 		 			  		 		 			customer programs we record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs which include enduser rebates and other volumebased incentives incentives may be provided in the form of idexx points credits or cash and are earned by end users upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods the summary of revenue reductions presented below reflects all revenue reductions recorded for the year for each particular program these amounts are presented on a net basis when applicable which accounts for any differences between estimates and actual incentives earned for the relevant customer marketing or incentive program these differences have been insignificant in all quarterly or annual periods our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			39 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			customer loyalty programs our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of idexx products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized revenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future  		 		 			  		 		 			upfront customer loyalty programs our upfront loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services our transition to an alldirect sales model and the subsequent increase in competitive activity resulted in an increase in the rate of new upfront customer loyalty incentives predominantly in response to competitive offerings during the fourth quarter of 2014 and in 2015 we saw a slowing in the rate of increase for new upfront customer loyalty incentives in the fourth quarter of 2015  		 		 			  		 		 			if a customer breaches its agreement it is required to refund all or a portion of the upfront cash or idexx points or make other repayments remedial actions or both these incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized within other current assets and other longterm assets and are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase idexx vetlab instruments diagnostic imaging systems or cornerstone practice management systems product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer we monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 impairments of customer acquisition costs were immaterial 		 		 			  		 		 			idexx instrument marketing programs our instrument marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program these arrangements are considered meas in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above revenue reductions related to instrument marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program requiring us to apply judgment to estimate future product purchases and utilization differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate these differences were not material for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 at december 31 2015 a 5 change in our estimate of future customer utilization would increase or reduce revenue by approximately 04 million 		 		 			  		 		 			reagent rental programs our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation we recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables we determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on relative selling prices and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customers minimum volume commitment the cost of the instrument is capitalized within property and equipment and is charged to cost of product revenue on a straightline basis over the term of the minimum purchase agreement  		 		 			  		 		 			idexx points may be applied against the purchase price of idexx products and services or applied to trade receivables due to us idexx points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs we estimate the amount of idexx points expected to expire or breakage based on historical expirations and we recognize the estimated benefit of breakage in proportion to actual redemptions of idexx points by customers on november 30 of each year unused idexx points earned before january 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate this variance was not material for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 		 		 			  		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			40 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive in determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data collected directly from end users which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by end users via idexx smartservice differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition  		 		 			  		 		 			following is a summary of revenue

			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 		 		 			  		 		 			a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized  		 		 			  		 		 			our business combinations regularly include contingent consideration arrangements that require additional consideration to be paid based on the achievement of established objectives most commonly surrounding the retention of customers during the postcombination period we assess contingent consideration to determine if it is part of the business combination or if it should be accounted for separately from the business combination in the postcombination period contingent consideration is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved with changes in fair value recognized in earnings changes in fair value of contingent consideration and differences arising upon settlement were not material during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding contingent consideration arising from recent business acquisitions 		 		 			  		 		 			we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our cag operating segment our water and lpd operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 referred to herein as the technology reporting unit a substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business included in our other segment is associated with products that have been or that we expect to be licensed to third parties realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments  		 		 			  		 		 			in evaluating goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would then perform step one of the twostep impairment test otherwise no further impairment test would be required in contrast we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the twostep impairment test doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 		 		 			  		 		 			as part of our goodwill testing process we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include the results of the most recent impairment test the competitive environment anticipated changes in product or labor costs revenue growth trends the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and longrange financial forecasts the longrange financial forecasts of the reporting units which are based upon managements longterm view of our markets are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			42 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			in the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014 we elected to bypass the qualitative approach and instead proceeded directly to step one of the twostep impairment test to assess the fair value of all of our reporting units  		 		 			  		 		 			as part of step one of the twostep impairment test we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows we make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions in addition we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit as of september 30 2015 the date that we performed our assessment of goodwill for impairment the total aggregate fair value of the reporting units approximated the companys market capitalization valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates  		 		 			  		 		 			we maintain approximately 65 million of goodwill associated with our remaining pharmaceutical product line outlicensing arrangements and certain retained drug delivery technologies collectively pharmaceutical activities that we seek to commercialize through arrangements with third parties currently our primary support for the carrying value of this goodwill is royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property under licensing agreements that expire in 2025 there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain or increase revenues from our remaining pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test for these pharmaceutical activities indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount of this reporting unit by approximately 15 million and 25 of the reporting units carrying value excluding these pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount for each of our reporting units by a range of approximately 950 million to 23 billion and 300 to 1560 of the reporting units carrying value  		 		 			  		 		 			while we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value we use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlooks for our reporting units actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital derived from industry peers changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 or 2013 		 		 			  		 		 			a prolonged economic downturn in the us or internationally resulting in lower longterm growth rates and reduced longterm profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting units fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill depending on the outcome of future impairment tests an impairment of goodwill would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 		 		 			we assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the

fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 		 		 			  		 		 			we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates substantially all of our options granted during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were granted in the first quarter of each year the weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the previous three years is as follows

options can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period similar to the expected term and other relevant factors higher estimated volatility increases the fair value of a stock option while lower estimated volatility has the opposite effect the total fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december 31 2015 was 120 million if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption was increased or decreased by 1 the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2015 would have increased or decreased by approximately 04 million and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2015 for options awarded during the same period would have increased or decreased by 01 million  		 		 			  		 		 			we derive the expected term assumption for stock options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected behavior with regard to option exercises the expected term is determined using a consistent method at each grant date a longer expected term assumption increases the fair value of stock option awards while a shorter expected term assumption has the opposite effect if the weighted average of the expected term was increased or decreased by one year the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2015 would have increased or decreased by approximately 11 million and 12 million respectively and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2015 for options awarded during 2015 would have increased or decreased by 02 million and 03 million respectively 		 		 			  		 		 			sharebased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which ranges from one to five years depending on the award sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors sharebased compensation expense is adjusted annually for actual results total sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2015 was 199 million which is net of a reduction of 36 million for actual and estimated forfeitures fluctuations in our overall employee turnover rate may result in changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience and

			the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 		 		 			  		 		 			on a quarterly basis we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2015 would not result in the recognition of material incremental valuation allowances 		 		 			  		 		 			for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies alternatively in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made   		 		 			  		 		 			our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax liability would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made for example an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated us state income tax rate would cause us to decrease our net deferred tax liability balance by 01 million this decrease in the net deferred liability would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted likewise a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated us state income tax rate would have the opposite effect 		 		 			  		 		 			we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 		 		 			  		 		 			we consider the majority of the operating earnings of nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us the cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were 4933 million at december 31 2015 of which approximately 3412 million was held in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2015 no provision has been made for the payment of us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made a determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable for several reasons including the complexity of laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we operate the varying tax treatment of potential repatriation scenarios and the timing of any future repatriation for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the us we have accounted for the tax impact on a current basis 		 		 		 		  		 			45 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 74 million and 61 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively which includes estimated interest expense and penalties 		 		 			  		 		 			results of operations and trends 		 		 			  		 		 			effects of certain factors on results of operations 		 		 			  		 		 			distributor purchasing and inventories when selling our products through distributors changes in distributors inventory levels can impact our reported sales and these changes may be affected by many factors which may not be directly related to underlying demand for our products by veterinary practices which are the endusers therefore we believe it is important to track sales to end users in the relevant periods by our significant distributors in order to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on our reported revenue in those periods effective january 1 2015 we fully transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us however changes in prior year us distributors inventory levels can still impact 2015 reported growth results in certain countries internationally we continue to sell our products through third party distributors although we are unable to obtain data for sales to end users from certain less significant nonus third party distributors we do not believe the impact of changes in these distributors inventories had or would have a material impact on our growth rates in the relevant periods following our transition to an all direct us distribution approach we anticipate that changes in distributor inventory levels will have an immaterial impact on our growth in future years 		 		 			  		 		 			where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to this as the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to this as the impact of changes in distributors inventories on growth if during the current year distributors inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors inventories would have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the current year distributors inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors inventories would have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period  		 		 			  		 		 			effective january 1 2015 we fully transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us and did not renew our existing contracts with our former key us distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014 under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables in the us aligning with our direct model for instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services 		 		 			  		 		 			we incurred transition costs to implement this alldirect sales strategy in the us including approximately 5 million in incremental expense during the year ended december 31 2014 resulting from the ramp up of sales and operating resources we also incurred 95 million in nonrecurring expenses during the year ended december 31 2014 associated with project management and other onetime costs required to implement this new strategy further we incurred onetime transitional impacts related to the drawdown of distributor inventory in the fourth quarter of 2014 resulting in a reduction in revenue and operating profit of 25 million and 21 million respectively in such period  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			46 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			during the three months ended december 31 2014 we began recognizing revenue on rapid assay kits and instrument consumables upon delivery to end users in the us instead of at distribution we also began to capture additional revenue that was previously earned by our distribution partners net of other changes related to this alldirect strategy such as free nextday shipping and a new returns policy for expired product we refer to this net additional revenue as distributor margin capture this net incremental revenue allowed us to expand our sales marketing and customer support resources which we expect will drive future revenue growth and to build out our distribution capability we expect investments in these areas will scale over time based on our expected future growth rates and provide accretive benefits to operating profit also as a result of the transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us we incurred additional working capital demands including inventory costs previously borne by our distributors and incremental accounts receivable resulting from a longer elapsed time to collect our receivables 		 		 			  		 		 			currency impact for the year ended december 31 2015 approximately 25 of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 28 and 26 for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured in the us and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure additionally our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on nonus denominated revenues see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact our future income tax expense could also be affected by changes in the mix of earnings including as a result of changes in the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to currencies in countries with differing statutory tax rates see part i item 1a risk factors included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding tax impacts  		 		 			  		 		 			the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not a measure defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap otherwise referred to herein as a nongaap financial measure as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results normalized for changes in currency in addition to reported results helps improve investors ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods  		 		 			  		 		 			effective january 1 2014 we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period prior to january 1 2014 we calculated this impact by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the current year period this change in methodology which was implemented to achieve operational efficiencies has not had a material impact on organic revenue growth see the subsection below titled results of operations for the definition of and other information regarding organic revenue growth 		 		 			  		 		 			during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the prior year changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our revenues by approximately 897 million due primarily to the strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against virtually all major foreign currencies in which we conduct business additionally our operating profit and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2015 were reduced by 212 million and 016 per share respectively which are net of offsetting gains of 209 million and 016 per share respectively from our foreign currency hedging activities  		 		 			  		 		 			at our current currency exchange rate assumptions we anticipate that the strengthening of the us dollar relative to major foreign currencies in which we transact will decrease total company revenue by approximately 40 million in the year ending december 31 2016 additionally these changes in foreign currency exchange rates are expected to reduce total company operating profit by 31 million and diluted earnings per share by 026 this unfavorable impact is net of offsetting foreign currency hedging gains which are expected to increase total company operating profit by 8 million and diluted earnings per share by 006 in the year ending december 31 2016 the above estimate assumes that the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies will reflect the euro at 107 the  		 		  		 			47 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		british pound at 141 the canadian dollar at 068 the australian dollar at 068 and the japanese yen at 118 to the us dollar for the full year of 2016 		 		 			  		 		 			effects of economic conditions demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment including slow economic growth high unemployment and credit availability negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments diagnostic imaging and practice management systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians additionally economic turmoil can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services in the us we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our cag customers although this data is a limited sample and susceptible to shortterm impacts such as weather which may affect the number of patient visits in a given period we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful longterm representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the us providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services 		 		 			  		 		 			economic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our water and lpd business customers water testing volumes may be susceptible to declines in discretionary testing for existing home and commercial sales and in mandated testing as a result of decreases in home and commercial construction testing volumes may also be impacted by severe weather conditions such as drought in addition fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and livestock testing programs  		 		 			  		 		 			we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets partially mitigate the potential effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates  		 		 			  		 		 			effects of patent expiration although the company has several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2015 and are expected to expire during 2016 and 2017 the expiration of these patents or licenses individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the companys financial position or future operations due to a range of factors including our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace the breadth quality and integration of our product offerings our existing customer relationships and our customer support our sales force the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies andor additional patents and our significant knowhow scale and investments

financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 as compared to the same period for the prior year net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates acquisitions and divestitures organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under managements control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends  		 		 			  		 		 			the percentage changes in revenue from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions are nongaap financial

these variances as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold the impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent recognition is reported within the caption unallocated amounts the net favorable impact to gross profit resulting from decreased manufacturing costs was due to the capitalization of favorable manufacturing variances primarily related to lpd vetlab consumables and our rapid assay test kit inventories during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 the majority of these favorable variances were recognized within unallocated amounts

		 		 			  		 		 			unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments decreased by 61 million to 69 million for the year ended december 31 2015 due primarily to a decrease in personnelrelated costs related to cost control initiatives and the absence of certain foreign currency losses on monetary assets partly offset by the impairment of internaluse software recorded during 2015 we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate these budgeted expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a

years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase in interest income was due primarily to higher yields from our portfolio of marketable securities that we purchased during 2015  		 		 			  		 		 			interest expense was 292 million for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to 154 million for the prior year the increase in interest expense was due primarily to approximately 450 million in senior notes that we issued and sold through private placements between july 2014 and june 2015 for which fixed interest rates range from 1785 to 376 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our senior notes in addition increased interest expense resulted from the impact of higher average

and 262 for the year ended december 31 2014 the increase in our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 was related to lower relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a nonrecurring benefit recognized during period ended december 31 2014 related to the deferral of intercompany profits that were included in prior year tax provisions in error which is not material to prior interim or annual periods

is a nongaap financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 as compared to the same period for the prior year net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates acquisitions and divestitures organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under managements control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends  		 		 			  		 		 			the percentage changes in revenue from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions are nongaap financial measures see the subsection above titled effects of certain factors on results of operations  currency impact for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred

			  		 		 			vetlab consumables revenue growth was due primarily to higher unit volumes the increase in unit volumes resulted primarily from growth of our installed base of catalyst and procyte dx instruments as a result of new customer acquisitions as well as an increase in testing from existing customers including those who upgraded to these instruments additionally vetlab consumables revenue benefited from higher average unit sales prices resulting from price increases these favorable impacts were partly offset by lower consumables volumes from our vettest chemistry instrument as

offset by higher sales of both our canine and feline testing products resulting from both an increase in us practicelevel sales volumes and higher average unit sales prices 		 		 			  		 		 			the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was due primarily to the impact of higher volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories resulting from increased testing from existing customers the acquisition of new customers and improved customer retention additionally the increase in revenue was favorably impacted by higher average unit sales prices due to price increases 		 		 			  		 		 			the decrease in cag diagnostics capital instruments revenue was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of deferred revenue associated with preorders for our catalyst one analyzer which we launched during the fourth quarter of 2014 and the impact of lower realized prices under our catalyst one introductory offer customers are provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument through the catalyst one delivery date as a result we do not recognize instrument revenue for preorders relating to the catalyst one introductory offer until the catalyst one is delivered these unfavorable impacts were partly offset by higher placements of our catalyst dx and procyte dx instruments primarily in europe and the asiapacific region and placements of our snap pro mobile device in north america for the year ended december 31 2014 the majority of snap pro mobile device placements were made under a reagent rental program for which instrument revenue will be recognized with the future sale of consumables 		 		 			  		 		 			the increase in customer information management and diagnostic imaging systems revenue was due primarily to a growing pet health

accounts receivable during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 was due primarily to our transition to an alldirect strategy in the us including the establishment of accounts receivable directly with our us endusers that previously purchased from our us distribution partners which take a longer elapsed time to collect additionally accounts receivable was impacted by increased revenues during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 relative to the same period in the prior year including the margin capture associated with the aforementioned alldirect strategy in contrast we received the benefit of collecting the final accounts receivable from our us distribution partners during december 2014 the net incremental cash provided by other assets and accrued liabilities was due primarily to lower income taxes receivable resulting from 2014 tax payments in advance of the tax increase prevention act enactment and related benefits late in the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the recognition of previously deferred catalyst instrument costs under the catalyst one introductory offer where we recognized the revenue and cost of catalyst instruments upon delivery of the catalyst one instruments or customer election to keep the catalyst dx instruments during 2015 these factors were partly offset by the incremental cash used for personnelrelated accruals including higher relative payments related to employee incentive programs and higher payments for other accruals due to increases in expenses during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 as compared to the same period of the prior year the cash used by deferred revenue during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 as compared to cash provided during the same period of the prior year was due primarily to the aforementioned catalyst one introductory offer cash used by inventories continued at a similar level to 2014 due to growth in volume commitment rental programs in international markets and relatively higher inventory levels to support new instrument and diagnostic test launches 		 		 			  		 		 			 we have historically experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vectorborne disease testing which has historically resulted in significant increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year 		 		 			  		 		 			investing activities cash used by investing activities was 3084 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 as compared to 804 million for the same period of the prior year the increase in cash used by investing activities was due primarily to the purchase of marketable securities during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 to a lesser extent incremental capital investments in our reference laboratory equipment and facilities during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 also contributed to the increase in cash used by investing activities  		 		 		 		  		 			63 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		our total capital expenditure plan for 2016 is

months ended december 31 2015 compared to cash used of 1034 million for the same period in 2014 the decrease in cash used by financing activities was due to a decrease in cash used to repurchase our common stock the aggregate issuance of approximately 250 million of senior notes during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 as compared to 200 million of senior notes issued during the same

aggregate cost of 4064 million as compared to purchases of 98 million shares for an aggregate cost of 6182 million during 2014 we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our shareholders and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our sharebased compensation programs repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our share

facility matures on december 4 2020 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date although the credit facility does not mature until december 2020 all amounts borrowed under the terms of the

foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manufacturing operations and inventory supply contracts are in the us but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below for the year ended december 31 2015 approximately 25 of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 28 and 26 for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for three of our subsidiaries located in the netherlands singapore and dubai the functional currency is the us dollar  		 		 			  		 		 			the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions if a hedging instrument qualifies for hedge accounting changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months  		 		 			  		 		 			our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into other foreign currency exchange contracts or foreigndenominated debt issuances to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific balance sheet exposures including net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k for details regarding eurodenominated notes issued during 2015 that we designated as a hedge of our euro net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries 		 		 			  		 		 			our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2015 we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions as a result no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle  		 		 			  		 		 			we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with the exception of certain emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge our exposure we hedge approximately 85 of the estimated exposure from intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and swiss franc we have additional unhedged foreign currency exposures related to foreign services and emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchases and sales totaled 1761 million and 1867 million at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively at december 31 2015 we had 25 million of net unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of related tax expense  		 		 			  		 		 			our foreign currency exchange impacts are comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and expenses 2 the impact of hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projected revenues and expenses for 2016 excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in  		 		  		 			67 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 10 strengthening of the us dollar would reduce operating income by approximately 13 million this level is higher than in previous years due to the addition of estimated unhedged foreign currency exposures including emerging market currencies that have higher relative revenue growth and volatility the impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have 		 		 			  		 		 			in december 2015 we refinanced our existing 700 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of 850 million with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on december 4 2020 the new credit facility and the previous credit facility are referred to collectively as the credit facility and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date although the credit facility does not mature until december 4 2020 all individual borrowings under the terms of the credit facility have a stated term between 30 and 180 days as discussed below we have entered into forward fixed interest rate swaps to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk through june 30 2016 borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2015 were 5730 million at a weightedaverage effective interest rate of 19 based on amounts outstanding under our credit facility as of december 31 2015 and assuming we do not enter into additional interest rate swap agreements following their expiration on june 30 2016 an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 would increase interest expense by approximately 53 million on an annualized basis 		 		 			  		 		 			the variable interest rate associated with 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility became effectively fixed at 136 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 beginning on march 28 2013 the variable interest rate associated with an additional 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility became effectively fixed at 164 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 we have designated these swaps as qualifying instruments to be accounted for as cash flow hedges at december 31 2015 we had 02 million in unrealized losses on interest rate swaps recorded in other comprehensive income net of related tax benefit see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities 		 		 			  		 		 			during the year ended december 31 2015 we purchased marketable debt securities which are classified as availableforsale and carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet included in this annual report on form 10k the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to changes in market interest rates as of december 31 2015 we estimate that a 1 increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately 08 million  		 		 			  		 		 			additionally our cash equivalents and marketable securities are subject to credit risk the fair value of our investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity credit deterioration financial results and other factors to minimize this risk we invest in high quality investments with original maturities of two years or less we perform periodic evaluations of the credit ratings related to cash equivalents and marketable securities 		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			item 8financial statements and supplementary data 		 		 			  		 		 			the response to this item is submitted as a separate

		 			f17 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 			 				 					 						level 2 				 				 					 						observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  				 			 			 				 					 						level 3 				 				 					 						unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities  				 			 		 		 			  		 		 			assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 		 		 			  		 		 			our foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets we measure the fair value of our foreign currency exchange contracts classified as derivative instruments using an income approach based on prevailing market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount the product of this calculation is then adjusted for counterparty risk we measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps classified as derivative instruments using an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve adjusted for counterparty risk  		 		 			  		 		 			the amount outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility and longterm debt are measured at carrying value in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets though we disclose the fair value of these financial instruments we determine the fair value of the amount outstanding under our credit facility and longterm debt using an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market interest rates for debt issues with similar remaining years to maturity adjusted for applicable credit risk our credit facility and longterm debt are valued using level 2 inputs the estimated fair value of our credit facility approximates its carrying value at december 31 2015 the estimated fair value and carrying value of our longterm debt were 5937 million and 5971 million respectively at december 31 2014 the estimated fair value and carrying value of our longterm debt were 3673 million and 3500 million respectively 		 		 			  		 		 			ucomprehensive income 		 		 			  		 		 			we report all changes in equity including net income and transactions or other events and circumstances from nonowner sources during the period in which they are recognized we have chosen to present comprehensive income which encompasses net income foreign currency translation adjustments gains and losses on our net investment hedge and the difference between the cost and the fair market value of investments in debt and equity securities forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income see note 19 for information about the effects on net income of significant amounts reclassified out of each component of aoci for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 we consider the foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment to be permanently invested and therefore have not provided income taxes on those amounts  		 		 			  		 		 			vconcentrations of risk 		 		 			  		 		 			financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash cash equivalents accounts receivable and derivatives to mitigate such risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents we place our cash with highlyrated financial institutions in noninterest bearing accounts that are insured by the us government and money market funds invested in government securities 		 		 			  		 		 			concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to certain customers to whom we make substantial sales to reduce risk we routinely assess the financial strength of our most significant customers and monitor the amounts owed to us taking appropriate action when necessary as a result we believe that accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts but historically have not experienced any material losses related to an individual customer or group of customers in any particular industry or geographic area  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			f18 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		to mitigate concentration of credit risk with respect to derivatives we enter into transactions with highlyrated financial institutions enter into master netting arrangements with the counterparties to our derivative transactions and frequently monitor the credit worthiness of our counterparties our master netting arrangements reduce our exposure in that they permit outstanding receivables and payables with the counterparties to our derivative transactions to be offset in the event of default we have not incurred such losses and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal 		 		 			  		 		 			inventory if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of the inventory we need to sell our products we could face cost increases or delays or discontinuations in product shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations many of the third parties that provide us with the instruments we sell and certain components raw materials and consumables used in or with our products are obtained from sole or single source suppliers some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary or complex in nature and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources  		 		 			  		 		 			wnew accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 		 		 			  		 		 			in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment which will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance within us gaap the core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services in doing so companies will be required to make certain judgments and estimates including identifying contract performance obligations estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price among separate performance obligations additionally the amendment requires disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts significant judgments reached in the application of the guidance and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract in july 2015 the fasb voted to defer the effective date of the amendment to apply to public business entities for annual and interim periods ending after december 15 2017 the amendment allows for two methods of adoption a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application we are in the process of determining the method of adoption and the impact of this amendment on our consolidated financial statements 		 		 			  		 		 			in august 2014 the fasb issued an amendment that requires management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in us auditing standards the amendments in this update provide guidance about managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are issued and to provide related footnote disclosures in doing so the amendments should reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures the amendments in this update

expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 		 		 			  		 		 			in february 2015 the fasb issued amendments which change the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to

issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts under current guidance our debt issuance costs are reflected as a deferred charge within other current assets and other longterm assets on our consolidated balance sheets this update is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 in august 2015 the fasb confirmed that the aforementioned amendments did not address the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to lineofcredit arrangements for lineofcredit arrangements borrowers have the option of presenting debt issuance costs as an asset which is subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement regardless of whether there are any related outstanding borrowings these amendments are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 		 		 			  		 		 			in april 2015 the fasb issued amendments that provide guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses if a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract the new guidance does not change a customers accounting for service contracts the standard update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within those years early adoption is permitted the standard allows for adoption retrospectively or prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date the amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 		 		 			  		 		 			in may 2015 the fasb issued amendments which remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value as a practical expedient for fair value removing investments measured using the practical expedient from the fair value hierarchy is intended to eliminate the diversity in practice that currently exists with respect to the categorization of these investments the new guidance requires reporting entities to continue to disclose information on investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value or its equivalent as a practical expedient to help users understand the nature and risks of the investments and whether the investments if sold are probable of being sold at amounts different from net asset value a reporting entity should apply the amendments retrospectively to all periods presented this update is effective for public business entities during fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 early adoption is permitted this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 		 		 			  		 		 			in july 2015 the fasb issued amendments which simplify the existing guidance which requires entities to subsequently measure inventory at the lower of cost or market value under the amendments an entity should measure inventory valued using a firstin firstout or average cost method at the lower of cost or net realizable value which is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation this update is effective for public business entities during fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 early adoption is permitted this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 		 		 			  		 		 			in september 2015 the fasb issued amendments which eliminate the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to retrospectively account for measurementperiod adjustments under the amendments an entity is required to record measurementperiod adjustments during the period in which the amounts are determined including changes in depreciation amortization and any other income effects as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date this update is effective for public business entities during fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 early adoption is permitted this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 		 		 			  		 		 			in november 2015 the fasb issued amendments which simplify the existing guidance which requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position under the amendments an entity should classify all deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent within the statement of financial position the amendments apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position and are effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods earlier application is permitted in 2016 we intend to early adopt this amendment which is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements

should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made a determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable for several reasons including the complexity of laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we operate the varying tax treatment of potential repatriation scenarios and the timing of any future repatriation for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the us

material claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 are relatively undeveloped as of december 31 2015 therefore it is possible that we could incur additional healthcare and wage

acceleration of the vesting of all stock options and restricted stock units upon any qualifying termination following a change in control at this time we believe the likelihood of terminations as a result of the scenarios described is remote and therefore we have not accrued for such loss contingencies 		 		 			  		 		 			we have total contingent consideration liabilities outstanding of up to

have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved we believe that the fair value of these

			we are exposed to certain risks related to our ongoing business operations the primary risks that we manage by using hedging instruments are foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into other foreign currency exchange contracts or foreigndenominated debt issuances to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific balance sheet exposures including net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries we enter into interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with borrowings under our variablerate credit facility 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			f41 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions including transactions denominated in euro british pound japanese yen canadian dollar australian dollar and swiss franc we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with wellcapitalized multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving hedging instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 		 		 			  		 		 			cash flow hedges 		 		 			  		 		 			we have designated our foreign currency exchange contracts and variabletofixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges as these derivative instruments mitigate the exposure to variability in the cash flows of forecasted transactions attributable to foreign currency exchange and interest rates unless noted otherwise we have also designated our derivative instruments as qualifying for hedge accounting treatment  		 		 			  		 		 			we did not dedesignate any instruments from hedge accounting treatment during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 gains or losses related to hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were not material at december 31 2015 the estimated amount of net gains net of income tax expense which are expected to be reclassified out of aoci and into earnings within the next twelve months is 23 million if exchange and interest rates do not fluctuate from the levels at december 31 2015 		 		 			  		 		 			we hedge approximately 85 of the estimated exposure from intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and swiss franc we have additional unhedged foreign currency exposures related to foreign services and emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year as a result our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the notional value of foreign currency exchange contracts may vary throughout the year the us dollar is the currency purchased or sold in all of our foreign currency exchange contracts the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales totaled 1761 million and 1867 million at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively 		 		 			  		 		 			we have entered into forward fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage the economic effect of variable interest obligations on amounts borrowed under the terms of our credit facility beginning on march 30 2012 the variable interest rate associated with 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility became effectively fixed at 136 plus the range of applicable interest rate fixed credit spreads credit spread through june 30 2016 beginning on march 28 2013 the variable interest rate associated with an additional 40 million of

we issued and sold our 2025 notes through a private placement an aggregate principal amount of 889 million approximately usd 100 million we have designated these eurodenominated notes as a hedge of our euro net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the euro relative to the us dollar as a result of this designation gains and losses from the change in translated us dollar value of these eurodenominated notes are recorded in aoci rather than to earnings we recorded a 19 million gain net of income tax within aoci as a result of this net investment hedge for the year ended december 31 2015 this unrealized gain recorded at december 31 2015 will not be reclassified in earnings until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operations or all or a portion of the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting treatment see note 11 to
