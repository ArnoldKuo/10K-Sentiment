recordkeeping testing quality storage and product disposal the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses 		 		 			  		 		 			veterinary diagnostic products diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products are regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the united states department of agriculture usda animal and plant health inspection service aphis these products must be approved by aphis before they may be sold in the us the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in japan germany the netherlands and many other countries we also are required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products we have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine and our distribution center in memphis tennessee our manufacturing facility in montpellier france has been approved by aphis and we have a permit to import products manufactured in montpellier france to the us for distribution 		 		 			  		 		 			our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are veterinary medical devices regulated by the us food and drug administration fda under the food drug and cosmetics act the fdc act while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the fda and does not subject us to the fdas current good manufacturing practices regulations cgmp these products must not be adulterated mislabeled or misbranded under the fdc act 		 		 			  		 		 			these instrument systems also are subject to the european medical device directives which create a single set of medical device regulations for all european union eu member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to obtain european conformity marking for their products 		 		 			  		 		 			water testing products our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is regulated by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert colilert18 colisure quantitray filtamax xpress enterolert and simplate for heterotrophic plate counts products have been approved by

		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			dairy testing products dairy products used in national conference on interstate milk shipments ncims milkmonitoring programs in the us are regulated by the fda as veterinary medical devices however before products requiring fda approval can be sold in the us performance data must be submitted in accordance with an fdaapproved protocol administered by an independent body such as the association of analytical communities research institute aoac ri following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by ncims an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap betalactam antibiotic residue test product has been approved by the fda ncims and aoac ri for sale in the us while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 		 		 			  		 		 			human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers our opti instrument systems are classified as class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti products the fdas quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing and which are submitted as a 510k

discussed elsewhere in this report 		 		 			  		 		 			our business lines are highly competitive and our failure to successfully execute certain strategies could have a material negative impact on our growth and profitability  		 		 			  		 		 			the companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy including

			  		 		 		 		  		 			17 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		our dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			we rely on thirdparty suppliers to provide components in our products manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves including packagedelivery services because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives actions taken by them could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations the risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with thirdparty suppliers on reasonable terms inconsistent or inadequate quality control relocation of supplier facilities supplier work stoppages and suppliers failure to comply with their contractual obligations problems with suppliers could materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market substantially decrease sales lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers 		 		 			  		 		 			in addition we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include the majority of our catalyst dx and catalyst one consumables vetlyte electrolyte consumables procyte dx hematology idexx vetautoread hematology vettest chemistry analyzers and related consumables and accessories sedivue dx urine sediment analyzer image capture plates used in our diagnostic imaging systems and certain components and raw materials used in our snap rapid assay kits and snap pro mobile device catalyst one lasercyte and lasercyte dx hematology analyzers livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products and water testing products to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers we seek when possible to enter into longterm contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices however some suppliers decline to enter into longterm contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers we may be unable to supply the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market  		 		 			  		 		 			many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products which are products that include materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products samples and the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products and could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			18 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets through the development of new technology the acquisition of rights to use existing technologies or the use of existing technologies when patents protecting such existing technologies expire new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services which could be superior to our products and services some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services similar to ours at lower sales prices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering with our transition to an alldirect sales strategy for our kits and consumables in the us effective january 1 2015 we did not renew our distribution agreements with our former key us distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014 including exclusive distribution agreements with some of the largest us distributors of companion animal veterinary products we historically sold significant amounts of our kits and consumables through our former us distribution partners and two of our previously exclusive us distribution partners joined a third former us distribution partner by beginning to carry competitive instruments consumables and rapid assay products in the fourth quarter of 2014 the promotion and sale of our competitors products by our former us distribution partners may adversely affect the retention of our customers for our kits and consumables and the sales and distribution of our products which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies also have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do 		 		 			  		 		 			various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 		 		 			  		 		 			in the us the manufacture and sale of many of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda or the epa our infectious disease diagnostic tests for animal health applications including most rapid assay canine and feline snap tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our dairy testing products require approval by the fda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa the manufacture and sale of our opti line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries in addition delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability  		 		 			  		 		 			we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws these legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future in addition any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could result in fines penalties and sanctions suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture market import export or sell our products and damage to our reputation 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			19 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business  		 		 			  		 		 			veterinarians are our primary customers for our cag products and services and the us veterinary industry has been consolidating in recent years the number of owners of veterinary hospitals has been declining and an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include mars petcare owner of banfield pet hospitals and blue pearl veterinary partners national veterinary associates and vca antech inc a similar trend exists in other countries such as in the uk and nordic countries and may in the future also develop in other international markets furthermore an increasing percentage of individuallyowned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech inc our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies or those that establish other affiliations with these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline  		 		 			  		 		 			our success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technologies  		 		 			  		 		 			we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights we also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of thirdparty technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license thirdparty patents and technologies on reasonable terms our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us  		 		 			  		 		 			we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights  		 		 			  		 		 			in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be prohibited from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			20 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			the market for our companion animal livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence for example the demand for our bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of regulatory changes in the european union including the european unions standing committee on the food chain and animal health agreement to allow european union member states the option to eliminate bse testing of healthy cattle at slaughter in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			our operations and reputation may be impaired if we our products or our services do not comply with evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection  		 		 			we offer products and services that collect and use data provided by client practices and individuals including practice management systems for veterinary practices eg cornerstone and neo online client communication tools and services eg pet health network pro and cloudbased technology through vetconnect plus that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients diagnostic data from idexx inclinic analyzers our rapid assays and reference laboratories in one place some of these products and services rely on thirdparty providers for cloud storage we also engage in ecommerce through various idexx websites and collect contact and other personally identifiable information from our customers and visitors to our websites 		 		 			 federal state and international laws and regulations govern the collection use retention sharing and security of personally identifiable information including data that we receive from our employees customers vendors and visitors to our websites and data collected by our customers and others when using our products and services in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions including requiring local storage and processing of data these laws and regulations continue to develop are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 		 		 			 for example on october 6 2015 the court of justice of the european union decided that the euus safe harbor framework that had been in place since 2000 which allowed transfers of personal data to the us in compliance with applicable eu data protection laws was invalid  on february 2 2016 us and european commission officials announced they had agreed upon a framework for a new data sharing agreement called the euus privacy shield to replace the euus safe harbor framework we are evaluating the potential impact of these changes to our business and practices and determining which of the multiple legal mechanisms available we will utilize to lawfully transfer personal data to the us in compliance with eu data protection laws  		 		 			 the costs associated with compliance with these evolving legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future and as a result may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business in addition we have and post on our website our own privacy policy concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us or our products and services to protect employee or customer data including as a result of a breach by or of a thirdparty provider or to comply with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles or our posted privacy policies could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or otherwise which could have an adverse effect on our business 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			21 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business  		 		 			  		 		 			we are a global business with 39 of our revenue during the year ended december 31 2015 attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside of the us any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against foreign currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen australian dollar and brazilian real adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales and profits that are made in those currencies the strengthening of the us dollar has a greater adverse effect on the profits from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars that are exported to international markets and a lesser effect on profits from foreign sourced products and services due to a natural hedge from international expenses denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies for the year ended december 31 2015 approximately 25 of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 28 and 26 for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars as well as affect our overall competitiveness in international markets the accumulated impacts from any continued longerterm growth in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 		 		 			  		 		 			our foreign currency hedging activities see note 17  hedging instruments in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements which are designed to minimize and delay but not to eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently offset the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates on our financial results over the limited time the hedges are in place we primarily hedge intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and swiss franc other foreign currency exposures related to foreign sourced services and emerging markets may not be practical to hedge in certain cases these exposures are not offset by foreign currency denominated costs as we primarily use foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months and enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions on a quarterly basis for the current and following year the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activities to offset longerterm appreciation in the value of the us dollar against nonus currencies may be limited factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales and other forecasts volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments since the hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility they not only temporarily reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also temporarily reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by a strengthening value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities  		 		 			  		 		 			during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the prior year changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our revenues by approximately 897 million due primarily to the strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against all major foreign currencies in which we conduct business additionally our operating profit and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2015 were reduced by 212 million and 016 per share respectively which are net of offsetting gains of 209 million and 016 per share respectively from our foreign currency hedging activities  		 		 			  		 		 			at our current foreign exchange rate assumptions we anticipate that the effect of a stronger us dollar will have a material adverse effect on our operating results by decreasing our revenues operating profit and diluted earnings per share in the year ending december 31 2016 by approximately 40 million 31 million and 026 per share respectively this unfavorable impact is net of offsetting foreign currency hedging gains which are expected to increase total company operating profit by 8 million and diluted earnings per share by 006 in the year ending december 31 2016 the actual impact of changes in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we transact may materially differ from our expectations described above the above estimate assumes that the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies will reflect the euro at 107 the british pound at 141 the canadian dollar at 068 the australian dollar at 068 and the japanese yen at 118 to the us dollar for the full year of 2016 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			22 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			a weak worldwide economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk  		 		 			  		 		 			a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems these conditions if they continue could result in a decrease in sales or decrease in sales growth of diagnostic products and services which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human pointofcare diagnostic instruments economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all  		 		 			  		 		 			risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 		 		 			  		 		 			for the year ended december 31 2015 approximately 39 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us compared to 43 and 42 for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively although we intend to continue to expand our international operations and business we may not be able to successfully promote market import export sell or distribute our products and services outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport restrictions duties and licensing requirements natural disasters unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets security concerns and local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices prohibited by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations  		 		 			  		 		 			further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors or changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition foreign government regulations may restrict our ability to repatriate funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions and any repatriation of such funds to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for us our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			23 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			our business sells many products through distributors which present risks that could

and assist us in promoting and creating a demand for our products outside the us our distributors often offer products from several different companies and certain of our distributors may carry our competitors products and promote our competitors products over our own products we have limited ability if any to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting marketing selling and supporting our products we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market sell and support our products effectively we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results in addition violations of anticorruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction failing to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the us may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position which could have a negative effect on our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market  		 		 			  		 		 			we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of thirdparty reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market

and resulting declines in the value of our portfolio could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 		 		 			  		 		 			if our quarterly or annual results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline  		 		 			  		 		 			our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product

jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions the various tax rates applied to the earnings of our activities are subject to significant change our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation also we have received tax rulings from various governments that have jurisdictional authority over our operations if we are unable to meet the requirements of such agreements or if they expire or are renewed on less favorable terms the result could negatively impact our future earnings additionally the european commission has opened formal investigations into specific tax rulings granted by several countries to specific taxpayers while we believe that our rulings in the netherlands and switzerland are different than those being discussed the ultimate resolution of such activities cannot be
