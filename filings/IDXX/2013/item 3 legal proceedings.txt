mwi veterinary supply inc mwi that became effective january 1 2013 under this modified agreement mwi is permitted to carry any competitive products without restriction or potential negative consequence this agreement satisfies the requirements of the consent agreement that we may have exclusive distribution agreements with only two of the three largest us distributors of companion animal veterinary products the modification of our agreement with mwi will result in one or more of our competitors selling products through mwi which we expect will increase the field sales resources of mwi used by those competitors to sell their products under the modified agreement with mwi we will provide lower compensation to mwi on sales of our products since we will no longer receive the benefits of mwis exclusive focus on our products we expect to reinvest savings from this lower rate of compensation in other sales and marketing resources and the selling efforts of our other distributors we believe that the reallocation of these sales resources will help mitigate the potential effects of the loss of exclusive focus of mwi and the additional field sales resources used by our competitors however there can be no assurances that we will be able to fully mitigate the competitive effects of the changes in the nature of our agreement with mwi any reduction in the relative effectiveness of our overall selling efforts could have an adverse effect on our results of operations which we do not believe would be material  		 		 			  		 		 			our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technologies  		 		 			  		 		 			we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us  		 		 			  		 		 			we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights  		 		 			  		 		 			in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			distributor purchasing patterns could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			we sell many of our products including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us through distributors distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the enduser demand for our products in addition our agreements with us distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason on 60 days prior written notice because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors the unanticipated loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency timing or size of distributor purchases could have a negative effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies consolidation within distribution channels increases our customer concentration level which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			17 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets and new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services which could be superior to our products and services some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering similar products and services to ours at lower sales prices which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do  		 		 			  		 		 			changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			the market for our companion animal and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			effective january 1 2009 the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease in the european union was increased from 30 months to 48 months which reduced the population of cattle tested by approximately 30 in february 2011 the european unions standing committee on the food chain and animal health scfcah agreed to allow its member states to further raise the recommended testing age to 72 months effective july 1 2011 which further reduced the population of cattle tested in december 2012 the scfcah agreed to allow european union member states the option to eliminate bse testing of healthy cattle at slaughter effective march 2013 the demand for our bse testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of these regulatory changes and could be further impacted by further changes that could be made in the future revenue from bse testing products was less than 10 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			18 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		increase in corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business  		 		 			  		 		 			an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us is owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include vca antech inc national veterinary associates and banfield pet hospital each of which is currently a customer of idexx a similar trend exists in the uk and may in the future also develop in other countries furthermore an increasing percentage of individually owned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums that we believe are positive for our business decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums in particular banfield pet hospital to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations which could be material in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech inc our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally use their reference laboratory services almost exclusively and shift a large portion of their testing from inclinic testing to their reference laboratories furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline  		 		 			  		 		 			our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market  		 		 			  		 		 			we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market  		 		 			  		 		 			 risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 		 		 			  		 		 			for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 41 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us compared to 43 and 41 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively various possible risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and licensing requirements natural disasters and unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results of operations for that period  		 		 			  		 		 			our operations are vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters or system failures  		 		 			  		 		 			the operation of all of our facilities may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters interruptions in power supply or other system failures while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			19 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		we manufacture many of our significant companion animal products including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock and poultry testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine certain of our companion animal products as well as our human pointofcare products are manufactured in roswell georgia we also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in bern switzerland and montpellier france in addition we maintain major distribution facilities in north america and in the netherlands and major reference laboratories in memphis tennessee leipzig germany ludwigsburg germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia markham ontario and wetherby the united kingdom therefore interruption of operations at any of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			 we rely on several information systems throughout our company to keep financial records process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions if we were to experience a system disruption that impacts any of our critical functions it could result in the loss of sales and customers financial misstatement and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business  		 		 			  		 		 			we maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for the longterm competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations  		 		 			  		 		 			we could be subject to class action litigation due to stock price volatility which if it occurs could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us  		 		 			  		 		 			 the market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities we may be the target of similar litigation in the future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention and resources which could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition  		 		 			  		 		 			if our quarterly or annual results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline resulting in losses to you  		 		 			  		 		 			our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures marketing programs changes in foreign currency exchange rates and litigation and claimrelated expenditures changes in competitors product offerings changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall  		 		 			  		 		 			future operating results could be negatively affected by the resolution of various uncertain tax positions and by potential changes to tax incentives  		 		 			  		 		 			in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions if we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives or if they expire or are renewed at less favorable terms our inability to realize these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			20 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		restrictions in our credit facility or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may limit our activities 		 		 			  		 		 			our ability to satisfy our obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility credit facility depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative negative and financial covenants our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under the credit facility which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt and possibly on terms not deemed favorable  		 		 			  		 		 			 we fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility if we were unable to obtain financing on favorable terms we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies which

investigation to determine whether idexx or others had engaged in unfair methods of competition in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act ftc act through pricing or marketing policies for companion animal veterinary products and services including but not limited to exclusive dealing or tying arrangements with distributors or endusers of those products or services the investigation  		 		 			  		 		 			on december 5 2012 we entered into an agreement containing consent order to cease and desist consent agreement with the ftc staff to resolve the investigation the consent agreement which is ten years in duration specifies that idexx may have exclusive distribution agreements with two of the following three distributors mwi veterinary supply inc mwi butler
