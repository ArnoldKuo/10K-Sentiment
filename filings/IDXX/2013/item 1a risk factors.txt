animal and plant health inspection service aphis these products must be approved by aphis before they may be sold in the us the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in japan germany the netherlands and many other countries we also are required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products we have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine and

competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy which include  		 		 			  		 		 			 				  			 		 			 			developing manufacturing and marketing innovative new or improved inclinic laboratory analyzers that drive sales of idexx vetlab instruments grow our installed base of instruments and increase demand for related consumable products services and accessories  		 			 				  			 		 			 			developing and introducing new proprietary diagnostic tests and services that provide valuable medical information to our customers and effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors  		 			 				  			 		 			 			increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of these products and the management of diagnostic information derived from our products  		 			 				  			 		 			 			providing our veterinary customers with the medical and business tools information and resources that enable

			 		 		 			 		  		our dependence on a limited number of suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or reduce our profitability  		 		 			  		 		 			we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include our catalyst dx and vettest consumables procyte dx hematology idexx vetautoread hematology vetlyte electrolyte idexx vetlab ua urinalysis vettest chemistry and coag dx blood coagulation analyzers and related consumables and accessories image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems and certain components and raw materials used in our snap rapid assay devices water testing products livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products and lasercyte and lasercyte dx hematology analyzers to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers we seek when possible to enter into longterm contracts that ensure an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices however some suppliers decline to enter into longterm contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers we may be unable to supply the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market  		 		 			  		 		 			many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products which are products that include materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products with samples and with the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could necessitate field actions that would require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products and could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 		 		 			  		 		 			a weak economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk  		 		 			  		 		 			a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits with their respective owners to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as the pet owner compliance with these recommendations economic weakness in our significant markets in recent years has caused and could continue to cause pet owners to skip or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or could affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems a decline in patient visits to the hospital in the willingness of pet owners to treat certain health conditions or approve certain tests in pet ownership in general or in the inclination of veterinarians to recommend certain tests or make capital purchases could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			15 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at the government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by the government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human pointofcare diagnostic instruments economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all  		 		 			  		 		 			strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business  		 		 			  		 		 			any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against nonus currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the profits on products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and exported to international markets for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 approximately 26 26 and 25 respectively of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies to mitigate such foreign currency exposure we utilize nonspeculative forward currency exchange contracts a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars  		 		 			  		 		 			various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products  		 		 			  		 		 			in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the united states department of agriculture usda the us food and drug administration fda and the us environmental protection agency epa our infectious disease diagnostic tests for animal health applications including most rapid assay canine and feline snap tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa our dairy testing products require approval by the fda prior to sale in the us the manufacture and sale of our opti line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers are regulated by the fda and these products require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the us or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture or sell our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 		 		 			  		 		 			the impact of one of our distributors becoming nonexclusive on our results of operations is uncertain  		 		 			  		 		 			on february 11 2013 the commissioners of the us federal trade commission ftc granted final approval of the agreement containing consent order to cease and desist consent agreement previously reached with the ftc staff to resolve the investigation into whether idexx had engaged

modified agreement with mwi veterinary supply inc mwi that became effective january 1 2013 under this modified agreement mwi is permitted to carry any competitive products without restriction or potential negative consequence this agreement satisfies the requirements of the consent agreement that we may have exclusive distribution agreements with only two of the three largest us distributors of companion animal veterinary products the modification of our agreement with mwi will result in one or more of our competitors selling products through mwi which we expect will increase the field sales resources of mwi used by those competitors to sell their products under the modified agreement with mwi we will provide lower compensation to mwi on sales of our products since we will no longer receive the benefits of mwis exclusive focus on our products we expect to reinvest savings from this lower rate of compensation in other sales and marketing resources and the selling efforts of our other distributors we believe that the reallocation of these sales resources will help mitigate the potential effects of the loss of exclusive focus of mwi and the additional field sales resources used by our competitors however there can be no assurances that we will be able to fully mitigate the competitive effects of the changes in the nature of our agreement with mwi any reduction in the relative effectiveness of our overall selling efforts could have an adverse effect on our results of operations which we do not believe would be material  		 		 			  		 		 			our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technologies  		 		 			  		 		 			we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us  		 		 			  		 		 			we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights  		 		 			  		 		 			in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			distributor purchasing patterns could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			we sell many of our products including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us through distributors distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the enduser demand for our products in addition our agreements with us distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason on 60 days prior written notice because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors the unanticipated loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency timing or size of distributor purchases could have a negative effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies consolidation within distribution channels increases our customer concentration level which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			17 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets and new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services which could be superior to our products and services some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering similar products and services to ours at lower sales prices which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do  		 		 			  		 		 			changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			the market for our companion animal and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			effective january 1 2009 the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease in the european union was increased from 30 months to 48 months which reduced the population of cattle tested by approximately 30 in february 2011 the european unions standing committee on the food chain and animal health scfcah agreed to allow its member states to further raise the recommended testing age to 72 months effective july 1 2011 which further reduced the population of cattle tested in december 2012 the scfcah agreed to allow european union member states the option to eliminate bse testing of healthy cattle at slaughter effective march 2013 the demand for our bse testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of these regulatory changes and could be further impacted by further changes that could be made in the future revenue from bse

consortiums could negatively affect our business  		 		 			  		 		 			an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us is owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include vca antech inc national veterinary associates and banfield pet hospital each of which is currently a customer of idexx a similar trend exists in the uk and may in the future also develop in other countries furthermore an increasing percentage of individually owned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums that we believe are positive for our business decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums in particular banfield pet hospital to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations which could be material in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech inc our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally use their reference laboratory services almost exclusively and shift a large portion of their testing from inclinic testing to their reference laboratories furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline  		 		 			  		 		 			our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market  		 		 			  		 		 			we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market  		 		 			  		 		 			 risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 		 		 			  		 		 			for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 41 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us compared to 43 and 41 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively various possible risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and licensing requirements natural disasters and unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results of operations for that period  		 		 			  		 		 			our operations are vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters or system failures  		 		 			  		 		 			the operation of all of our facilities may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters interruptions in power supply or other system failures while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			19
