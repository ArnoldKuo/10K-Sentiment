european conformity marking for their products 		 		 			  		 		 			water testing products our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is regulated by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval

ourselves including packagedelivery services because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives actions taken by them could have a negative effect on our results of operations the risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with thirdparty suppliers on reasonable terms inconsistent or inadequate quality control relocation of supplier facilities supplier work stoppages and suppliers failure to comply with their contractual obligations problems with suppliers could negatively impact our ability to supply the market substantially decrease sales lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers 		 		 			  		 		 			in addition we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include the majority of our catalyst dx consumables procyte dx hematology idexx vetautoread hematology vetlyte electrolyte vettest chemistry analyzers and related consumables and accessories image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems and certain components and raw materials used in our snap rapid assay devices livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products and lasercyte and lasercyte dx hematology analyzers to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers we seek when possible to enter into longterm contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices however some suppliers decline to enter into longterm contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers we may be unable to supply the market which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market  		 		 			  		 		 			many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products which are products that include materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products samples and the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products and could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			17 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			changes to our relationships with distributors and distributor purchasing patterns could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			we sell many of our products including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us through distributors as a result we are dependent on these distributors to sell our products and assist us in promoting and creating a demand for our products our agreements with us distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason and certain of our distributors may carry our competitors products and promote our competitors products over our own products further distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the enduser demand for our products because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors the unanticipated loss of a distributor changes to our relationship with a distributor such as a distributor becoming nonexclusive or unanticipated changes in the frequency timing or size of distributor purchases could have a negative effect on our results of operations 		 		 			  		 		 			distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies further consolidation within distribution channels could increase our reliance on a limited number of distributors  		 		 			  		 		 			increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets and new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services which could be superior to our products and services some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services similar to ours at lower sales prices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do  		 		 			  		 		 			various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products  		 		 			  		 		 			in the us the manufacture and sale of many of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda or the epa our infectious disease diagnostic tests for animal health applications including most rapid assay canine and feline snap tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our dairy testing products require approval by the fda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa the manufacture and sale of our opti line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries in addition delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			18 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws for example on february 11 2013 the ftc granted final approval of the agreement containing consent order to cease and desist previously reached with the ftc staff to resolve the investigation into whether idexx had engaged in unfair methods of competition in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act pursuant to this agreement we may have exclusive distribution agreements with only two of the three largest us distributors of companion animal veterinary products and as a result we entered into a modified agreement with mwi under which it is permitted to carry any competitive products without restriction or potential negative consequence any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to our business practices or the manufacture and sale of our products in the us or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture or sell our products or impact our ability to market or distribute our products which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			increase in corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business  		 		 			  		 		 			an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include banfield pet hospital national veterinary associates and vca antech inc each of which is currently a customer of idexx a similar trend exists in other countries such as in the uk and nordic countries and may in the future also develop in other international markets furthermore an increasing percentage of individuallyowned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech inc our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline  		 		 			  		 		 			our success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technologies  		 		 			  		 		 			we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights we also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of thirdparty technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license thirdparty patents and technologies on reasonable terms our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us  		 		 			  		 		 			we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights  		 		 			  		 		 			in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be prohibited from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 		 		  		 			19 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		  		 		 			changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results  		 		 			  		 		 			the market for our companion animal livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence for example the demand for our bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of regulatory changes in the european union including the european unions standing committee on the food chain and animal health agreement to allow european union member states the option to eliminate bse testing of healthy cattle at slaughter effective march 2013 in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			our operations and reputation may be impaired if we do not comply with regulations and policies regarding privacy and protection of user data 		 		 			  		 		 			we offer online client communication tools and services to veterinary practices through pet health network pro and cloudbased technology through vetconnect plus that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients diagnostic data from idexx inclinic analyzers our rapid assays and reference laboratories in one place we also engage in ecommerce through the idexxcom website and various international idexx websites federal state and international laws and regulations govern the collection use retention sharing and security of data that we receive from customers visitors to the websites of our customers and others in addition we have and post on our website our own privacy policy concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or otherwise which could have an adverse effect on our business 		 		 			  		 		 			strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business  		 		 			  		 		 			any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against nonus currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the profits on products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and exported to international markets approximately 26 of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars  		 		 			  		 		 			a weak economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk  		 		 			  		 		 			a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations economic weakness in our significant markets in recent years has caused and could continue to cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems these conditions if they  		 		  		 			20 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		continue could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human pointofcare diagnostic instruments economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all  		 		 			  		 		 			risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 		 		 			  		 		 			for the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 42 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us compared to 41 and 43 for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively various possible risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and licensing requirements natural disasters and unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors in addition foreign government regulations may restrict our ability to repatriate funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions and any repatriation of such funds to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for us our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period  		 		 			  		 		 			our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market  		 		 			  		 		 			we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of thirdparty reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market  		 		 			  		 		 			our operations are vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters system disruptions and security breaches 		 		 			  		 		 			the operation of all of our facilities may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters interruptions in power supply or other system failures while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or

ludwigsburg germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia markham ontario wetherby uk and tokyo japan interruption of operations at any of these facilities could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			 we rely on several information systems throughout our company to keep financial records process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions although we employ system backup measures our current disaster recovery plan may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities further our information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches including computer viruses any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen if we were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions it could result in the loss of sales and customers financial misstatement and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business furthermore any access to public disclosure of or other loss of information as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings which could damage our reputation cause a loss of confidence in our products and services and adversely affect our business 		 		 			  		 		 			we maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for the longterm competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations  		 		 			  		 		 			if our quarterly or annual results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline  		 		 			  		 		 			our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures customer marketing and incentive programs changes in foreign currency exchange rates and litigation and claimrelated expenditures changes in competitors product offerings changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall  		 		 			  		 		 			future operating results could be negatively affected by the resolution of various uncertain tax positions and by potential changes to tax incentives  		 		 			  		 		 			in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions if we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives or if they expire or are renewed at less favorable terms our inability to realize these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings

and our outlicensing arrangements in an other category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments the segment income loss from operations discussed within this report for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 has been retrospectively revised to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including our product and service categories and our geographic areas 		 		 			  		 		 			items that are not allocated to our operating segments are as follows a portion of corporate support function and personnelrelated expenses certain manufacturing costs corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories the difference between estimated and actual sharebased compensation expense certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses and variances from standard cost for products sold resulting from changes in certain currency exchange rates in our segment disclosure these amounts are shown under the caption unallocated amounts 		 		 			  		 		 			the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 		 		 			  		 		 			companion animal group 		 		 			  		 		 			our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management which all results in a mutually successful partnership with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets loyal customers and expanding practice revenues 		 		 			  		 		 			cag diagnostics we refer to the extensiveness and integration of our diagnostic and information management offerings as the idexx diagnostic advantage we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratories veterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patients diagnostic results which allows them to spot trends and achieve greater medical insight  		 		 			  		 		 			the breadth and complementary nature of our diagnostic solutions also provides us scale in sales and distribution during 2013 we reorganized our companion animal diagnostic sales organization in north america transitioning our specialty sales force that represented either inclinic or outside reference laboratory diagnostics to account representatives who represent all cag diagnostic modalities in addition to this reorganization we increased the size of our sales force resulting in smaller geographically sized sales territories these changes allowed for more frequent customer contact by a consistent sales professional we believe these changes will continue to strengthen customer loyalty and help support growth of our diagnostic revenues in north america 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			29 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and nonrecurring revenues revenues related to capital placements of our inclinic vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature while revenues from the associated proprietary vetlab consumables snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our vetlab instruments are recurring in nature instrument sales have significantly lower gross margins than those provided by our recurring revenues especially in the case of vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits therefore the mix of nonrecurring and recurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins  		 		 			  		 		 			diagnostic capital revenue revenues related to the placement of the vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature in that the customer will buy an instrument once over the course of many years but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes during the early stage of an instruments life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline in the early stage of an instruments life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as reagent rentals in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a longterm customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables 		 		 			  		 		 			we place our catalyst dx chemistry analyzers through sales leases rental and other programs in addition we continue to place vettest instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales as of december 31 2013 these two chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 35000 units a substantial portion of 2013 catalyst dx analyzer placements were to customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst dx placement at a vettest customer substitutes a catalyst dx consumable stream for a vettest consumable stream nonetheless we have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a vettest analyzer to a catalyst dx analyzer due to the superior capability flexibility and ease of use of the catalyst dx which leads to additional testing by the customer  		 		 			  		 		 			in addition to the catalyst dx analyzer we have begun preselling the catalyst one instrument and currently have a customer marketing program underway through which customers preordering a catalyst one are provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument through the catalyst one release date under this marketing program we do not recognize instrument revenue until delivery of the catalyst one instrument which we anticipate to occur throughout 2015 as we continue to experience growth in placements of catalyst analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of vettest analyzers and in sales of related consumables  		 		 			  		 		 			the procyte dx analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer which we launched in 2010 in addition we sell the lasercyte dx and lasercyte analyzers and vetautoread analyzers as of december 31 2013 these four hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 25000 units a substantial portion of procyte dx analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their lasercyte analyzer to a procyte dx analyzer however an increasing number of placements have been made at competitive accounts since the launch of this instrument in 2010 we also continue to place a substantial number of lasercyte dx and lasercyte instruments both new and refurbished as tradeups from the vetautoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts in 2013 a significant number of lasercyte instruments that were placed were refurbished instruments that had been received in trade in the sale of a procyte dx analyzer as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte dx analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte and vetautoread analyzers and in sales of related consumables  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			30 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			we seek to enhance the attractiveness of our snap rapid assay tests by providing the snapshot dx which automatically reads certain snap test results and records those results in the electronic medical record and the upcoming snap pro mobile device which activates snap tests captures and saves images of the results and records invoice charges in the patient record this promotes practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced in addition the snap pro mobile device activates the test properly times the run and captures an image of the result which can be shared with pet owners on the snap pro screen or via vetconnect plus we anticipate the snap pro mobile device will begin shipping at the end of the first quarter of 2014 we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products 		 		 			  		 		 			our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer loyalty and retention and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing work flows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results greater sample throughput broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments in addition we provide marketing tools and consultative services that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis 		 		 			  		 		 			with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab station and vetconnect plus client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 		 		 			  		 		 			recurring diagnostic revenue revenues from our proprietary vetlab consumable products our snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our vetlab instruments are considered recurring in nature our inclinic diagnostic solutions consisting of our vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with boardcertified veterinary specialists and pathologists combined with the benefit of sameday or nextday turnaround times  		 		 			  		 		 			we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in vetlab instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry and hematology testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes in connection with the purchase of instruments we also offer protocolbased rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers  		 		 			  		 		 			our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers through easeofuse superior performance sensitivity specificity and by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			31 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories in several markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of test menu technology employed quality turnaround time customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our inclinic offerings  		 		 			  		 		 			profitability from our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements startup laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on our operating margin recurring revenue growth is achieved both through increased sales to existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers we believe the reorganization of our sales force will lead to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our inclinic diagnostic modalities in recent years reoccurring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers and as a result of our upfront customer loyalty programs under these arrangements we provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services in the future  		 		 			  		 		 			health monitoring and biological materials testing we believe the acquisition of the research and diagnostic laboratory business of the college of veterinary medicine from the university of missouri allows us to leverage our expertise in veterinary diagnostics and expand our integrated offering of reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and inclinic testing solutions in the adjacent bioresearch market  		 		 			  		 		 			customer information management and digital imaging systems our cornerstone practice management system provides a superior integrated information solution backed by exceptional customer support and education to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practices business objectives including a quality client experience staff efficiency and practice profitability we differentiate our practice management systems through enhanced functionality ease of use and connectivity with inclinic vetlab instruments and outside reference laboratory test results pet health network pro online client communication and education service complements the entire idexx product offering by educating pet owners and building loyalty through engaging the pet owner before during and after the visit thereby building client loyalty and driving more patient visits  		 		 			  		 		 			our digital imaging systems offer a convenient system that provides superior image quality and software capability that enables sharing of these images with clients virtually anywhere and enhanced diagnostic features and customer workflow backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in cag 		 		 			  		 		 			water  		 		 			  		 		 			our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers primarily consist of water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support sales of water testing products outside of the us represented 51 of total water product sales in 2013 and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe further we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			32 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			livestock poultry and dairy 		 		 			  		 		 			we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests for various cattle swine and poultry diseases and conditions and have active research and development and inlicensing programs in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers disease and reproductive management programs disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products in addition increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products  		 		 			  		 		 			our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of milk by processors and producers and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverages almost exclusively the snap platform as well as the production equipment of our rapid assay business incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penetration in the processor and producer segments of the dairy market and develop product line enhancements and extensions  		 		 			  		 		 			based on the episodic nature of disease outbreaks the performance of this business can fluctuate in 2013 lpd organic revenues declined approximately 1 resulting primarily from lower sales volumes of bovine tests resulting from changes in european testing requirements and lower sales volumes of dairy snap tests used for the detection of the contaminant aflatoxin m1 and antibiotic residues in milk  		 		 			  		 		 			in 2013 approximately 88 of our sales in this business were from markets outside of the us most notably europe the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally see part i item 1a risk factors 		 		 			  		 		 			other 		 		 			  		 		 			opti medical systems our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals we seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instruments life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments  		 		 			  		 		 			our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this units knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat and catalyst dx platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale  		 		 			  		 		 			in 2013 approximately 83 of our sales in the opti medical systems business were from markets outside of the us most

condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 		 		 			  		 		 			we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 		 		 			  		 		 			revenue recognition 		 		 			  		 		 			we recognize revenue when four criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured see note 2i to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 		 		 			  		 		 			multiple element arrangements meas arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the idexx vetlab suite of analyzers digital imaging systems or practice management software combined with one or more of the following products extended maintenance agreements emas consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services practice management software is frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide delivery of our idexx vetlab instruments digital imaging systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement emas consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services typically are delivered over future periods generally one to six years in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future  		 		 			  		 		 			we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element if available we establish the selling price of each element based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately we use thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available we generally determine selling price based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements when these arrangements include a separatelypriced ema we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straightline basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive if there is no stated contractual price for an ema or the separately stated price is not substantive we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			34 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			when arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value when vsoe exists for all elements or by using the residual method when there is vsoe for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered element all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered we determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 		 		 			  		 		 			certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services we apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement if the future discount is significant and incremental we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement if the discount in the mea approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales that discount is not considered incremental 		 		 			  		 		 			customer programs we record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs which include enduser rebates and other volumebased incentives incentives may be provided in the form of idexx points credits or cash and are earned by endusers upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods the summary of revenue reductions presented below reflects all revenue reductions recorded for the year for each particular program these amounts are presented on a net basis when applicable which accounts for any differences between estimates and actual incentives earned for the relevant customer marketing or incentive program these differences have been insignificant in all quarterly or annual periods our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows 		 		 			  		 		 			customer loyalty programs our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of idexx products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized revenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future based on applicable product inventories held by distributors at the end of the period  		 		 			  		 		 			upfront customer loyalty programs our upfront loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services if a customer breaches its agreement it is required to refund a prorated portion of the upfront cash or idexx points among other things these incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized and recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase idexx vetlab instruments digital imaging systems or cornerstone practice management systems product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer we monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011

marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program these arrangements are considered meas in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above revenue reductions related to instrument marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program and require us to apply judgment to approximate future product purchases and utilization differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate these differences were not material for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 at december 31 2013 a 5 change in our estimate of future customer utilization would increase or reduce revenue by approximately 04 million 		 		 			  		 		 			reagent rental programs our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation we recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables we determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on relative selling prices and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customers minimum volume commitment the cost of the instrument is charged to cost of product revenue on a straightline basis over the term of the minimum purchase agreement  		 		 			  		 		 			idexx points may be applied against the purchase price of idexx products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade receivables due to us idexx points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs we estimate the amount of idexx points expected to expire or breakage based on historical expirations and we recognize the estimated benefit of breakage as idexx points are issued to customers on november 30 of each year unused idexx points earned before january 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate this variance was not material for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 		 		 			  		 		 			future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to approximate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive in determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected directly from end users which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by end users via idexx smartservice differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition

			revenue reduction is provided on a net basis which accounts for any differences between estimates and actual incentives earned 		 			  		 		 			inventory valuation 		 		 			  		 		 			we write down the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value when warranted based on assumptions of future demand market conditions remaining shelf life or product functionality if actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on results of operations  		 		 			  		 		 			valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 		 		 			  		 		 			a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized contingent consideration is included within the purchase price and is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in earnings  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			37 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our cag operating segment our water and lpd operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 referred to herein as the technology reporting unit a substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business included in our other segment is associated with products that have been or that we expect to be licensed to third parties realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments our dairy and opti medical businesses for which there is no goodwill associated are presented in our lpd and other segments respectively 		 		 			  		 		 			in evaluating goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the morelikelythannot threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would then perform step one of the twostep impairment test otherwise no further impairment test would be required in contrast we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the twostep impairment test doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 		 		 			  		 		 			as part of our goodwill testing process we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include the results of the most recent impairment test the competitive environment anticipated changes in product or labor costs revenue growth trends the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and longrange financial forecasts the longrange financial forecasts of the reporting units which are based upon managements longterm view of our markets are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 		 		 			  		 		 			in the fourth quarter of 2013 we elected to bypass the qualitative approach and instead proceeded directly to step one of the twostep impairment test to assess the fair value of all of our reporting units  		 		 			  		 		 			as part of step one of the twostep impairment test we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows we make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions in addition we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit as of september 30 2013 the date that we performed our assessment of goodwill for impairment the total aggregate fair value of the reporting units approximated the companys market capitalization valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates the results of our goodwill impairment test indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount for each of our reporting units by a range of approximately 116 million to 15 billion and 123 to 1600 of the reporting units carrying value 		 		 			  		 		 			while we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value we use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlooks for our reporting units actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital derived from industry peers changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 or 2011 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			38 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		a prolonged economic downturn resulting in lower longterm growth rates and reduced longterm profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting units fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill depending on the outcome of future impairment tests an impairment of goodwill would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 		 		 			we assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a riskadjusted discount rate no impairments of intangible assets were identified during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011  		 		 			  		 		 			as a result of operating losses incurred during 2012 by our opti medical systems business in the human market we tested the related asset group including intangible assets for impairment in the third quarter of 2012 simultaneously we also reviewed the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets and determined that based on investments in our next generation opti analyzer it is likely we will experience a reduction in revenues from the existing products based on the acquired technologies sooner than previously estimated as a result we reduced the estimated useful lives for certain opti medical systems intangible assets resulting in increased amortization in the fourth quarter of 2012 and future periods  		 		 			  		 		 			as of september 30 2012 we determined the future net undiscounted cash flow for our opti medical systems business in the human market which is comprised of those cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the asset group exceeded the 17 million carrying value of the related asset group including intangible assets of 5 million by approximately 60  		 		 			  		 		 			for the year ended december 31 2013 opti medical systems achieved operating profit and cash flows that exceeded our estimates used as of september 30 2012 therefore no impairment test was performed during the year ended december 31 2013 		 		 			  		 		 			inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results approved business plans expected growth rates and tax rates many of the factors used in assessing future cash flows are outside the control of management and changes in the assumptions or estimates could materially affect the future cash flows of an asset group and therefore could affect the amount of potential future impairment of the asset in addition the performance of the business is subject to the various risks described above that are associated with our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market see part i item 1a risk factors no impairments of intangible assets were identified during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 		 		 			  		 		 			sharebased compensation 		 		 			  		 		 			our sharebased compensation programs provide for grants of stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units along with the issuance of employee stock purchase rights the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			39 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates substantially all of our options granted during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were granted in the first quarter of each year the weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the previous three years is as follows

contractual terms of seven years 		 			  		 		 			changes in the subjective input assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period similar to the expected term and other relevant factors lower estimated volatility reduces the fair value of a stock option while higher estimated volatility has the opposite effect the total fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december 31 2013 was 105 million if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption was increased or decreased by 1 the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2013 would have increased or decreased by approximately 3 and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2013 for options awarded during the same period would have increased or decreased by less than 01 million  		 		 			  		 		 			we derive the expected term assumption for stock options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected behavior with regard to option exercises the expected term is determined using a consistent method at each grant date a longer expected term assumption increases the fair value of stock option awards while a shorter expected term assumption has the opposite effect if the weighted average of the expected term was increased or decreased by one year the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2013 would have increased by 10 or decreased by 11 respectively and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2013 for options awarded during 2013 would have increased or decreased by 02 million 		 		 			  		 		 			sharebased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which ranges from one to five years depending on the award sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors sharebased compensation expense is adjusted annually for actual results total sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2013 was 166 million which is net of a reduction of 30 million for actual and estimated forfeitures fluctuations in our overall employee turnover rate may result in changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience and therefore could have a significant unanticipated impact on sharebased compensation expense  		 		 			  		 		 			modifications of the terms of outstanding options may result in significant increases or decreases in sharebased compensation there were no material modifications to the terms of outstanding options restricted stock units or deferred stock units during 2013 2012 or 2011 		 		 			  		 		 			the fair value of stock options restricted stock units deferred stock units and employee stock purchase rights issued during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 totaled 222 million 182 million and 255 million respectively the total unrecognized compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures for unvested sharebased compensation awards outstanding at december 31 2013 was 349 million which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 16 years  		 		 		 		  		 			40 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		income taxes 		 		 			  		 		 			the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 		 		 			  		 		 			on a quarterly basis we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2013 would not result in the recognition of material incremental valuation allowances 		 		 			  		 		 			for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies alternatively in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made   		 		 			  		 		 			our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax liability would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made for example an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated us state income tax rate would cause us to decrease our net deferred tax liability balance by 03 million this decrease in the net deferred liability would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted likewise a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated us state income tax rate would have the opposite effect 		 		 			  		 		 			we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 		 		 			  		 		 			we consider the majority of the operating earnings of nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us the cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were 3498 million at december 31 2013 of which approximately 2781 million was held in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2013 no provision has been made for the payment of us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made a determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the us we have accounted for the tax impact on a current basis 		 		 			  		 		 			we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 66 million and 63 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively which includes estimated interest expense and penalties 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			41 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			results of operations and trends 		 		 			  		 		 			effects of certain factors on results of operations 		 		 			  		 		 			distributor purchasing and inventories the instrument consumables and rapid assay products in our cag segment are sold in the us and certain other geographies by third party distributors who purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices which are the end users as a result distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and in a given period may not be directly related to underlying enduser demand for our products consequently reported results may reflect fluctuations in inventory levels held at distributors and not necessarily reflect changes in underlying enduser demand therefore we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue  		 		 			  		 		 			where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to this as the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to this as the impact of changes in distributors inventories on growth if during the current year distributors inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors inventories have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the current year distributors inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors inventories have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period  		 		 			  		 		 			consistent with our estimate as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we believe that our us cag distributors typically hold inventory equivalent to approximately four weeks of the anticipated enduser demand for vetlab consumables and rapid assay products at the end of a quarter 		 		 			  		 		 			currency impact approximately 26 of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured in the us and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offset this exposure additionally our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on nonus denominated revenues 		 		 			  		 		 			the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not a measure defined by us gaap otherwise referred to herein as a nonus gaap measure we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the current year period as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results normalized for changes in currency in addition to reported results helps improve investors ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods 		 		 			  		 		 			during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2012 changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total company revenue by approximately 95 million due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the japanese yen and the australian dollar 		 		 			  		 		 			during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2011 changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total company revenue by approximately 190 million due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			42 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			effects of economic conditions demand for many of our products and services has been negatively affected by economic conditions since mid2008 in our cag segment we believe that low economic growth and relatively high unemployment have led to negative or cautious consumer sentiment which has affected the number of patient visits to veterinary clinics based on data provided by a subset of our customers that use our practice management systems we observed patient visits were flat to slightly down beginning in 2009 with a slight improvement in the growth of patient visits beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012 and further improvement during 2013 over the previous year periods although the rate of improvement has not been steady we believe that this data though limited provides a fair and meaningful representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the us that is consistent with trends in the us economic environment and consumer sentiment in contrast economic conditions in certain european countries remain challenging which continues to negatively impact our cag segment in particular  		 		 			  		 		 			we believe that the overall trend in patient visits since the beginning of the economic downturn has had a slightly negative impact on the growth rate of sales of rapid assay tests instrument consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services in addition we believe the rate of growth of sales of our instruments digital radiography and practice management systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians has also been affected by continued caution among veterinarians regarding economic conditions weaker economic conditions since mid2008 have also caused our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services resulting in lower revenue growth due to limited price increases for certain products  		 		 			  		 		 			we also believe that current economic conditions have affected purchasing decisions of our water and lpd business customers lower water testing volumes have resulted from a decline in discretionary testing and a decline in mandated testing as a result of lower home and commercial construction fiscal difficulties in certain european countries have also reduced government funding for some water and livestock testing programs  		 		 			  		 		 			we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets have partially mitigated the effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates looking forward we are cautiously optimistic that the improvements we began to see in the us commencing in the fourth quarter of 2012 and continuing in 2013 are reflective of a gradual improvement in the macroeconomic environment that over time will further reduce these effects  		 		 			  		 		 			effects of patent expiration although the company has several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties expected to expire during 2014 and 2015 the expiration of these patents or licenses individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the companys financial position or future operations due to a range of factors including our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace the breadth quality and integration of our product offerings our existing customer relationships and our customer support our sales force the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies andor

considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under managements control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends  		 		 			  		 		 			 		 		 		 		  		 			43 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			organic revenue growth and the percentage changes in revenue from currency and acquisitions are nonus gaap measures see the subsection above titled effects of certain factors on results of operations for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have

			  		 		 			the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs including costs associated with the acquisition of a brazilian distributor and increased spending on promotional activities in the asia pacific region the increase in general and administrative expense was due primarily to costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the brazilian distributor a portion of which will not recur partly offset by lower personnelrelated costs and a decrease in intangible asset amortization research and development expense during the year ended december 31 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year  		 		 			  		 		 			other operating expenses for other increased 25 million to 102 million for the year ended december 31 2013 due primarily to a 35 million milestone payment earned during the year ended december 31 2012 related to the 2008 sale of product rights previously included in our pharmaceutical product line partly offset by lower personnelrelated costs in our opti medical line of business the pharmaceutical milestone payment was not classified as revenue because the transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business rather it was reflected as a reduction to general and administrative expenses as earned   		 		 			  		 		 			unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased 49 million to 121 million for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the prior year due primarily to losses incurred resulting from the bankruptcy of a freight payment and audit service provider freight service company partly offset by lower legal and other professional fees incurred as result of the resolution of the ftc investigation in february 2013 and proceeds received during 2013 in connection with the demutualization of an insurance provider in march 2013 the freight service company provided notice to us that all freight payment services would cease immediately and that certain amounts paid by us to the freight service company were not subsequently remitted to our freight carriers due to an employee fraud and a breakdown in internal controls both at the freight service company concluding in significant losses and the resulting bankruptcy in response we recorded a 39 million loss related to these unremitted amounts in general and administrative expense during the year ended december 31 2013 we continue to monitor the freight service companys bankruptcy proceeding but we cannot be certain of any recovery at this time

2012 the decrease in our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 was due primarily to the research and development rampd tax credit for the year ended december 31 2012 the us legislation authorizing the rampd tax credit had expired and no associated tax benefit was recognized within this period on january 2 2013 us federal legislation was enacted that retroactively allowed an rampd tax credit for all of 2012 and extended the rampd tax credit through the year ending december 31 2013 because the related legislation was enacted in 2013 the full benefit of the rampd tax credit related to the prior years activities was recognized in 2013 in addition higher relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates also contributed to the decrease in our effective income tax rate  		 		 			  		 		 			as of january 1 2014 the us rampd tax credit has again expired and we will not benefit from this provision unless legislation renewing the program is enacted 		 		 			  		 		 			in 2014 it is reasonably possible that we could recognize up to 04 million of income tax benefits that have not been recognized at december 31 2013 the income tax benefits are primarily due to the lapse in the statutes of limitations for various tax jurisdictions 		 		 			  		 		 			twelve months

organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under managements control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends  		 		 			  		 		 			organic revenue growth and the percentage changes in revenue from currency and acquisitions are

information about this revision 		 		 			  		 		 			the increase in cash provided by accrued liabilities during the year ended december 31 2013 was greater than the prior year due primarily to higher personnelrelated accruals including employee incentive programs commissions and other compensation related expenses the increase in cash used for purchasing inventories during the year ended december 31 2013 was less than the prior year due primarily to the timing of inventory receipts of slides used with our chemistry instruments during the year ended december 31 2012 higher revenues during the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to the same period of the prior year were the driver of the increase in cash used by accounts receivable during the year ended december 31 2013 the increase in cash used by other assets was due primarily to investments in certain supply contracts and higher spending on prepaid maintenance related to software licenses during the year ended december 31 2013 		 		 			  		 		 			we historically have experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by the payment of annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vectorborne disease testing which has historically resulted in significant increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year 		 		 			  		 		 			investing activities cash used by investing activities was 861 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 581 million for the same period in 2012 the increase in cash used by investing activities during the year ended december 31 2013 was due primarily to incremental purchases of property and equipment and the acquisition of a brazilian distributor the incremental purchases of property and equipment were primarily related to investments to expand our worldwide headquarters in westbrook maine and investments in manufacturing equipment our acquisition of the brazilian distributor is described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k  		 		 			  		 		 			our total capital expenditure plan for 2014 is estimated to be approximately 80 million which includes capital investments in manufacturing equipment investments in internal use software and information technology infrastructure the renovation and expansion of our facilities and reference laboratories 		 		 			  		 		 			financing activities cash used by financing activities was 1025 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to cash used of 1253 million for the same period in 2012 the decrease in cash used by financing activities was due primarily to the issuance of 150 million of senior notes an increase in net borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and an increase in cash received from the exercise of stock options these favorable factors were mostly offset by an increase in cash used to repurchase common stock 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			56 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock increased by 2355 million during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the prior year from the inception of our share repurchase program in august 1999 to december 31 2013 we have repurchased 490 million shares during the year ended december 31 2013 we purchased 40 million shares for an aggregate cost of 3678 million compared to purchases of 15 million shares for an aggregate cost of 1323 million during 2012 we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our shareholders and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our sharebased compensation programs repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our share repurchases 		 		 			  		 		 			in may 2013 we refinanced our prior 300 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of 450 million the credit facility with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on may 8 2018 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date though the credit facility does not mature until may 8 2018 all amounts borrowed under the terms of the credit facility are reflected in the current liabilities section in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because the credit facility contains a subjective material adverse event clause which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the credit facility if we fail to notify the syndicate of such an event applicable interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility generally range from 0875 to 125 percentage points above the london interbank offered rate or the canadian dollardenominated bankers acceptance rate dependent on our leverage ratio or the prevailing prime rate plus a maximum spread of up to 025 dependent on our leverage ratio 		 		 			  		 		 			in december 2013 we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate amount of 150 million of senior notes consisting of 75 million of 394 series a senior notes due

purchasers named therein the senior note agreement the proceeds from the senior notes were used for general corporate purposes including repaying amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility  		 		 			  		 		 			we may prepay the senior notes in an amount not less than 50 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes then outstanding at the principal amount so prepaid plus the applicable makewhole amount as set forth in the senior note agreement upon no more than 60 or less than 10 days written notice to the holders of the senior notes in addition in the event of a change in control of the company as defined in the senior note agreement or upon the disposition of certain assets of the company the proceeds of which are not reinvested as set forth in the senior note agreement at the option of the holders of the senior notes we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the senior notes at a price equal the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest 		 		 			  		 		 			the senior note agreement contains affirmative negative and financial covenants customary for agreements of this type the negative covenants include restrictions on liens indebtedness of subsidiaries of the company priority indebtedness fundamental changes investments transactions with affiliates certain restrictive agreements and violations of sanctions laws and regulations the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as defined in the senior note agreement not to exceed 35to1 at december 31 2013 we were in compliance with the covenants of the senior note agreement 		 		 			  		 		 			net borrowing and repayment activity under the credit facility resulted in incremental cash provided of 960 million during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the prior year at december 31 2013 we had 2770 million outstanding under the credit facility the general availability of funds under the credit facility was further reduced by 10 million for a letter of credit issued related to our workers compensation policy covering claims for the years ending 2009 through 2013 the obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility which includes customary events of default including payment defaults defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants the inaccuracy of representations or warranties bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults defaults relating to judgments certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 the failure to pay specified indebtedness and a change of

million during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the prior year due primarily to an increase in the average exercise price  		 		 			  		 		 			other commitments contingencies and guarantees 		 		 			  		 		 			under our workers compensation insurance policies for us employees since january 1 2003 we have retained the first 250000 in claim liability per incident with aggregate maximum claim liabilities per year of 20 million in each of 2013 2012 and 2011 the insurance company provides for insurance claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits we have recognized cumulative expenses of 06 million 06 million and 04 million for claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our estimated liability for workers compensation was 12 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 are relatively undeveloped as of december 31 2013 therefore it is possible that we could incur additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs beyond those previously recognized up to our aggregate liability for each of the respective claim years for the years ended on or prior to december 31 2011 based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability per year our maximum liability in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized is not material as of december 31 2013 as of december 31 2013 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 13 million to the insurance companies as security for these claims in connection with these policies 		 		 			  		 		 			under our current employee healthcare insurance policy for us employees we retain claims liability risk up to 325000 300000 and 275000 per incident per year in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we recognized employee healthcare claim expense of 292 million 230 million and 210 million during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively which includes actual claims paid and an estimate of our liability for the uninsured portion of employee healthcare obligations that have been incurred but not paid should employee health insurance claims exceed our estimated liability we would have further obligations our estimated liability for healthcare claims that have been incurred but not paid as of december 31 2013 and 2012 was 43 million and 32 million respectively 		 		 			  		 		 			we have contingent commitments outstanding of up to 55 million related primarily to the acquisition of an intangible asset in 2008 and due to the seller upon our

consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manufacturing operations and inventory supply contracts are in the us but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below approximately 26 of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for one of our subsidiaries located in the netherlands the functional currency is the us dollar  		 		 			  		 		 			the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions if a derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months  		 		 			  		 		 			our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific significant transactions as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we were not hedging any specific significant transactions 		 		 			  		 		 			our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2013 we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions as a result no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle  		 		 			  		 		 			we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchase and sales totaled 1683 million and 1570 million at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively at december 31 2013 we had 10 million in net unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax expense  		 		 			  		 		 			our foreign currency exchange risk is comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and expenses 2 the impact of settled hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projected revenues and expenses for 2014 excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 10 strengthening of the us dollar would reduce operating income by approximately 8 million the impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have 		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			59 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			in may 2013 we refinanced our existing 300 million unsecured revolving

syndicate of multinational banks which matures on may 8 2018 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date we are subject to interest rate risk based on the terms of the credit facility to the extent that the london interbank rate libor or the canadian dollardenominated bankers acceptance rate cdor increases borrowings under the credit facility bear interest in the range from 0875 to 125 percentage points credit spread above the libor or the cdor dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio and the interest period terms for the outstanding borrowings which range from one to six months as discussed below we have entered into forward fixed interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk in future periods borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2013 were 277 million at a weightedaverage effective interest rate of 16 based on amounts outstanding and our interest rate swap effective at december 31 2013 an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 would increase interest expense by approximately 20 million on an annualized basis 		 		 			  		 		 			 beginning on march 30 2012 the variable interest rate associated with 40 million of borrowings

into transactions with highlyrated financial institutions enter into master netting arrangements with the counterparties to our derivative transactions and frequently monitor the credit worthiness of

optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the

volatility of our stock over periods that are similar to the expected terms of grants and other relevant factors we derive the expected term based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected employee behavior with regard to option exercise the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury yields for a maturity approximating the expected term calculated at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards  		 		 			  		 		 			we determine the assumptions used in the valuation of option awards as of the date of grant differences in the expected stock price volatility expected term or

but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility because of the impact of deferred tax accounting other than interest and penalties the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period

uninsured portion of employee healthcare obligations that have been incurred but not paid should employee health insurance claims exceed our estimated liability we would have further obligations our estimated liability for healthcare claims that have been incurred but not paid as of december 31 2013 and 2012 was 43 million and 32 million respectively 		 		 			  		 		 			we have entered into an employment agreement with our chief executive officer whereby payment may be required if we terminate his employment without cause other than following a change in control the amount payable is based upon the executives salary at the time of termination and the cost to us of continuing to provide certain benefits had this officer been terminated without cause at december 31 2013 other than following a change in control we would have had an obligation for salaries and benefits of approximately 16 million under such agreement in addition the agreement provides for continued vesting of his outstanding equity awards for a period of two years  		 		 			  		 		 			we have entered into employment agreements with each of our officers that require us to make certain payments in the event the officers employment is terminated under certain circumstances within a certain period following a change in control the amount payable by us under each of these agreements is based on the officers salary and bonus history at the time of termination and the cost to us of continuing to provide certain benefits had all of our officers been terminated in qualifying terminations following a change in control at december 31 2013 we would have had aggregate obligations of approximately 215 million under these agreements these agreements also provide for the acceleration of the vesting of all stock options and restricted stock units upon any qualifying termination following a change in control at this time we believe the likelihood of terminations as a result of the scenarios described is remote and therefore we have not accrued for such loss contingencies 		 		 			  		 		 			from time to time we have received notices alleging that our products infringe thirdparty proprietary rights although we are not aware of any pending litigation with respect to such claims patent litigation frequently is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any infringement proceedings that may be commenced against us if we lose any such litigation we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages as a result of the litigation 		 		 			  		 		 			the following relates to a contingency that existed at december 31 2012 and was fully resolved in february 2013 with respect to a us federal trade commission ftc investigation  		 		 			  		 		 			in january 2010 we received a letter from the ftc stating that it was conducting an investigation to determine whether idexx or others had engaged in unfair methods of competition in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act ftc act through pricing or marketing policies for companion animal veterinary products and services including but not limited to exclusive dealing or tying arrangements with distributors or endusers of those products or services the investigation  		 		 		 		  		 			f32 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		  		 		 			on december 5 2012 we entered into an agreement containing consent order to cease and desist consent agreement with the ftc staff to resolve the investigation and on february 11 2013 the commissioners of the ftc granted final approval of the consent agreement the consent agreement which is ten years in duration specifies that idexx may have exclusive distribution agreements with two of the following three distributors mwi veterinary supply inc mwi henry schein animal health and webster veterinary on september 28 2012 we entered into a modified agreement with mwi that became effective january 1 2013 this modified agreement satisfies the requirements of the consent agreement and permits mwi to carry any competitive products without restriction or potential negative consequence  		 		 			  		 		 			we continue to believe that our marketing and sales practices for companion animal veterinary products and services do not violate applicable antitrust laws we entered into the consent agreement because we believe this course helped us avoid long and costly litigation and that our business would not be materially adversely affected  		 		 			  		 		 			guarantees 		 		 			  		 		 			we enter into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses the precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement in many cases we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically unlimited we have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved we believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal accordingly we have recorded no liabilities for these obligations at december 31 2013 and 2012 		 		 			  		 		 			when acquiring a business we sometimes assume liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition we have recorded 31 million of probable preacquisition liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2013 we did not have any probable preacquisition liabilities or guarantees that should be recognized at december 31 2012 		 		 			  		 		 			note 15 segment reporting 		 		 			  		 		 			prior to january 1 2013 we operated primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we continue to refer to as cag water quality products water and diagnostic products for livestock and poultry health which we referred to as livestock and poultry diagnostics we also operated two smaller operating segments that comprised products for milk quality and safety dairy and products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market opti medical financial information about our dairy and opti medical operating segments was combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements in an other category because they did not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments  		 		 			  		 		 			in 2013 we combined the management of our livestock and poultry diagnostics and dairy lines of business into our lpd segment to more effectively realize the market synergies between the product lines and to achieve operational efficiencies our opti medical operating segment remains combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements in an other category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments the segment income loss from operations discussed within this report for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 has been retrospectively revised to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments  		 		 			  		 		 			operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decisionmaker or decisionmaking group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance our chief operating decisionmaker is our chief executive officer our operating segments include cag water lpd and other assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting purposes  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			f33 		 		 			 		   		 			 		 		 			 		  		 		 		 			cag develops designs manufactures and distributes products and performs services for veterinarians and the bioresearch market primarily related to diagnostics and information management water develops designs manufactures and distributes a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological parameters in water lpd develops designs manufactures and distributes diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to detect a wide range of diseases and monitor the health status in livestock and poultry as well as products that ensure the quality and safety of milk and food opti medical develops designs manufactures and distributes pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the human medical diagnostics market  		 		 			  		 		 			the accounting policies of our segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note 2 except for inventories as discussed below intersegment revenues which are not included in the table below were not material for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 		 		 			  		 		 			items that are not allocated to our operating segments are as follows a portion of corporate support function and personnelrelated expenses certain manufacturing costs corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories the difference between estimated and actual sharebased compensation expense and certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses these amounts are shown under the caption unallocated amounts 		 		 			  		 		 			we estimate our sharebased compensation expense corporate support function expenses and certain personnelrelated costs and allocate the estimated expense to the operating segments this allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption unallocated amounts  		 		 			  		 		 			with respect to manufacturing costs the costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period we capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with us gaap we then record these costs as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold the impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent expense recognition is reported within the caption unallocated amounts  		 		 			  		 		 			additionally in certain geographies where we maintain inventories in currencies other than the us dollar the product costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold which is stated at the budgeted currency exchange rate from the beginning of the fiscal year in these geographies the variances from standard cost for products sold related to changes in currency exchange rates are reported within the caption unallocated amounts 		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 			  		 		 		 		  		 			f34

operations the primary risks that we manage by using derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific significant transactions we enter into interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with our variablerate credit facility 		 		 			  		 		 			the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions including transactions denominated in euro british pound japanese yen canadian dollar australian dollar and swiss franc we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 		 		 			  		 		 			cash flow hedges 		 		 			  		 		 			we have designated our foreign currency exchange contracts and variabletofixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges

have also designated our derivative instruments as qualifying for hedge accounting treatment  		 		 			  		 		 			we did not dedesignate any instruments from hedge accounting treatment during the

for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year as a result our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the notional value of foreign currency exchange contracts may vary throughout the year the us dollar is the currency purchased or sold in all of our foreign currency exchange contracts the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales totaled 1683 million and 1570 million at december 31 2013
