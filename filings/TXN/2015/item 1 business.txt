we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in 35 countries we have two reportable segments analog and embedded processing we report the results of our remaining business activities in other we expect analog and embedded processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead and we therefore focus our resources on these segments in 2014 we generated 1305 billion of revenueproduct informationsemiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors generally known as chips combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit we have tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment we sell catalog and applicationspecific standard semiconductor products both of which we market to multiple customers catalog products are designed for use by many customers andor many applications and are sold through both distribution and direct channels the life cycles of catalog products generally span multiple years with some products continuing to sell for decades after their initial release applicationspecific standard products assps are designed for use by a smaller number of customers and are targeted to a specific application the life cycles of assps are generally determined by endequipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months although some can be used across multiple generations of customers products the vast majority of our revenue is derived from products that are differentiated from competitors products our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results additional information regarding each segment followsanaloganalog generated 81 billion of revenue in 2014 analog semiconductors change realworld signals such as sound temperature pressure or images by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as embedded processors analog semiconductors also are used to manage power in every electronic device whether plugged into a wall or running off a battery our analog products are used in many markets particularly personal electronics and industrialsales of our analog products generated 62 percent of our revenue in 2014 according to external sources the market for analog semiconductors was 44 billion in 2014 our analog segments revenue in 2014 was 18 percent of this fragmented market the leading position we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time our analog segment includes the following product lines high volume analog amp logic hval power management power high performance analog hpa and silicon valley analog svahval productsthese include highvolume integrated analog products for specific applications and highvolume catalog products hval products support applications like automotive safety devices touchscreen controllers lowvoltage motor drivers and integrated motor controllerspower productsthese include both catalog products and assps that help customers manage power in electronic systems our broad portfolio of power products is designed to enhance the efficiency of powered devices using battery management solutions portable power conversion devices power supply controls and pointofload products hpa productsthese include catalog analog products that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products hpa products include highspeed data converters amplifiers sensors high reliability products interface products and precision analog products that are typically used in systems that require high performance hpa products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years2sva productsthese include a broad portfolio of industrial highvoltage power management data converter interface and operational amplifier catalog products used in manufacturing a wide range of electronic systems sva products support applications like video and data interface products electrical arcfault detection systems and mobile lighting and display systems sva products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years sva consists primarily of products that we acquired through our purchase of national semiconductor corporation national in 2011embedded processingembedded processing generated 27 billion of revenue in 2014 embedded processing products are the brains of many electronic devices embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance power and cost depending on the application the devices vary from simple lowcost products used in electric toothbrushes to highly specialized complex devices used in communications infrastructure equipment our embedded processing products are used in many markets particularly industrial and automotivean important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rampd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the nextsales of embedded processing products generated 21 percent of our revenue in 2014 according to external sources the market for embedded processors was 18 billion in 2014 we held the number two position which represented 15 percent of this fragmented market we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over timeour embedded processing segment includes the following major product lines processor microcontrollers and connectivity processor productsthese include digital signal processors dsps and applications processors dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data applications processors are typically tailored for a specific class of applications such as communications infrastructure and automotive infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems they are also sold into broad industrial applicationsmicrocontroller productsthese include selfcontained systems with a processor core memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory and program length with no operating system and low software complexity analog components that control or interface with sensors and other systems are often integrated into microcontrollers connectivity productsthese include products that enable electronic devices to seamlessly connect and transfer data and the requirements for speed data capability distance power and security vary depending on the application our connectivity products support many wireless technologies to meet these requirements including lowpower wireless network standards like zigbee and other technologies like bluetooth wifi and gps our connectivity products are usually designed into customer devices alongside our processor and microcontroller products enabling data to be collected transmitted and acted uponotherother generated 22 billion of revenue in 2014 and includesrevenue from our smaller product lines such as dlp products primarily used in projectors to create highdefinition images certain custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics and calculators revenue from our baseband products and from our omaptm applications processors and connectivity products sold into smartphones and consumer tablets our exit from these legacy wireless products was completed in 2013 royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies we also include in other items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments these include acquisitionrelated charges restructuring charges and certain corporatelevel items such as litigation expenses environmental costs insurance settlements and gains and losses from other activities including asset dispositions3financial information with respect to our segments and our
