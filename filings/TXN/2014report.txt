designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in 35 countries we have three segments analog embedded processing and other we expect analog and embedded processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead and we therefore focus our resources on these segmentsfinancial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the united states is contained in note 16 to the financial statements captioned segment and geographic area data in tis 2013 annual report to stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference to such report risks attendant to our foreign operations are described in item 1a risk factorsproduct informationsemiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors come in two basic forms individual transistors and integrated circuits generally known as chips that combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit our products more than 100000 orderable parts are integrated circuits that are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipmentwe sell catalog and applicationspecific standard semiconductor products both of which we market to multiple customers catalog products are designed for use by many customers andor many applications and are sold through both distribution and direct channels the vast majority of our catalog products are differentiated we also sell catalog commodity products but they account for a small percentage of our revenue the life cycles of catalog products generally span multiple years with some products continuing to sell for decades after their initial release applicationspecific standard products assps are designed for use by a smaller number of customers and are targeted to a specific application the life cycles of assps are generally determined by endequipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months although some can be used across multiple generations of customers productsour segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels and how management allocates resources and measures results additional information regarding each segments products followsanaloganalog semiconductors change realworld signals  such as sound temperature pressure or images  by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as embedded processors analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in every electronic device whether plugged into a wall or running off a battery we estimate that we sell our analog products to more than 100000 customers our analog products are used in many markets particularly personal electronics and industrial sales of our analog products generated about 60 percent of our revenue in 2013 according to external sources the worldwide market for analog semiconductors was about 40 billion in 2013 our analog segments revenue in 2013 was 72 billion or about 18 percent of this fragmented market the leading position we believe that we are well positioned to increase our market share over time our analog segment includes the following major product lines high volume analog amp logic hval power management power high performance analog hpa and silicon valley analog svahval products these include highvolume integrated analog products for specific applications and highvolume catalog products hval products support applications like automotive safety devices touch screen controllers low voltage motor drivers and integrated motor controllers3power products these include both catalog products and assps that help customers manage power in electronic systems our broad portfolio of power products is designed to enhance the efficiency of powered devices using battery management solutions portable power conversion devices power supply controls and pointofload productshpa products these include catalog analog products that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products hpa products include highspeed data converters amplifiers sensors high reliability products interface products and precision analog products that are typically used in systems that require high performance hpa products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 yearssva products these include a broad portfolio of power management data converter interface and operational amplifier catalog analog products used in manufacturing a wide range of products sva products support applications like video and data interface products electrical faultarc detection systems and mobile lighting and display systems sva products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years sva consists primarily of products that we acquired through our purchase of national semiconductor corporation in 2011embedded processingembedded processing products are the brains of many electronic devices embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance power and cost depending on the application the devices vary from simple lowcost products used in electric toothbrushes to highly specialized complex devices used in wireless basestation communications infrastructure equipment our embedded processing products are used in many markets particularly industrial and automotivean important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rampd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next sales of embedded processing products generated about 20 percent of our revenue in 2013 according to external sources the worldwide market for embedded processors was about 17 billion in 2013 our embedded processing segments revenue in 2013 was 24 billion this was the number two position and represented about 14 percent of this fragmented market we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over timeour embedded processing segment includes the following major product lines processors microcontrollers and connectivityprocessor products these include digital signal processors dsps and applications processors dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data applications processors run an industrystandard operating system and perform multiple complex tasks often communicating with other systemsmicrocontroller products microcontrollers are selfcontained systems with a processor core memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory and program length with no operating system and low software complexity analog components that control or interface with sensors and other systems are often integrated into microcontrollers connectivity products connectivity products enable electronic devices to seamlessly connect and transfer data and the requirements for speed data capability distance and power vary depending on the application our connectivity products support many wireless technologies to meet these requirements including lowpower wireless network standards like zigbee and other technologies like bluetooth wifi and gps our connectivity products are usually designed into customer devices alongside our processor and microcontroller products enabling data to be collected transmitted and acted upon 4otherother includes revenue from our smaller product lines such as dlp primarily used in projectors to create highdefinition images certain custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics and calculators it includes royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies and revenue from transitional supply agreements related to acquisitions and divestitures we also include revenue from our baseband products and from our omaptm applications processors and connectivity products sold into smartphones and consumer tablets all of which are product lines that we previously announced we are exiting and are collectively referred to as legacy wireless products revenue from legacy wireless products declined throughout the year and our exit from these products is complete other generated 26 billion of revenue in 2013 we also include in other restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated charges as these charges are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments acquisitionrelated charges include certain fairvalue adjustments restructuring charges transaction expenses acquisitionrelated retention bonuses and amortization of intangible assets other also includes certain corporatelevel items such as litigation expenses environmental costs insurance proceeds and assets and liabilities associated with our centralized operations such as our worldwide manufacturing

product revenue graphing and educational calculators5market characteristicsproduct cyclethe global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature market cyclethe semiconductor cycle is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity these are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle the semiconductor cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilitiesseasonalityour revenue is subject to some seasonal variation our semiconductor revenue tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared to the second and third quarters calculator revenue is tied to the us backtoschool season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarterscompetitive landscapethe analog and embedded processing markets are highly fragmented as a result we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies in each of those markets including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operatewe believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a companys product line the strength and depth of the sales network technological innovation product development execution technical support customer service quality reliability price and scale the primary competitive factors for our analog products include design proficiency a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance applications and sales support and manufacturing expertise and capacity the primary competitive factors for our embedded processing products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets installed base of software software expertise applications and sales support and a products performance integration and power characteristicsmanufacturingsemiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is tested the wafer is cut into individual units and each unit is assembled into a package that then is usually retested the entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks with most products completing within 8 to 16 weeksthe cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by technology our analog products and most of our embedded processing products can be manufactured using mature and stable and therefore less expensive equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced logic products such as some of our processor productswe own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of capacity potentially lowering our profit margins conversely as product demand rises and factory utilization increases the fixed costs are spread over increased output potentially benefiting our profit margins 6we expect to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs to supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital we utilize the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries and subcontractors in 2013 we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers from external foundries and about 35 percent of our assemblytest services from subcontractors in 2013 we closed older wafer fabrication facilities in hiji japan and houston texas in december 2013 we acquired an assemblytest facility in the hitech zone of chengdu china adjacent to our existing fabrication facility in chengduinventoryour inventory practices differ by product but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand because of the longer product life cycles of catalog products and their inherently lower risk of obsolescence we generally carry more inventory of those products than applicationspecific products additionally we sometimes maintain product inventory in unfinished wafer form as well as higher finishedgoods inventory of lowvolume catalog products allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand we also have consignment inventory programs in place for our largest customers and some distributorsdesign centers our design centers provide design engineering and product application support as well as aftersales customer service the design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customerscustomersour products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems original design manufacturers odms and companies within the electronics manufacturing services industry emsi an oem designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures inhouse or has manufactured by others an odm designs and manufactures products for other companies which then sell those products under their own brand emsi companies manufacture distribute and provide repair services for electronic products for oems in addition we sell to customers through distributors in 2013 no single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our revenuesales and distributionwe market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force and distributors we have sales or marketing offices in 34 countries worldwide and have expanded our sales networks in the emerging markets of china india and eastern europe over the last few years distributors located around the world account for about 55 percent of our revenue our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers they also sell products from our competitors our distribution network holds a mix of distributorowned and ticonsigned inventory over time we expect this mix will continue to shift more toward consignment we sell our calculator products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers acquisitions divestitures and investments from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us in september 2011 we acquired national semiconductor corporationbacklogwe define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be under certain circumstances subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations accordingly our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period our backlog of orders was 106 billion at december 31 2013 and 117 billion at december 31 20127raw materials we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future intellectual property we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiationour semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our businesswe often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license certain of our patents to other companies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory termswe own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are texas instruments and our corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include dlp and omaptmresearch and development our rampd expense was 152 billion in 2013 compared with 188 billion in 2012 and 172 billion in 2011 our primary areas of rampd investment are analog and embedded processing products we conduct most of our rampd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties including software suppliers universities and select external industry consortia and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology from time to time we may terminate rampd projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product we do not expect that all of our rampd projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute significant revenue until at least a few years following completion 8executive officers of the registrantthe following is an alphabetical list of the names and ages of the executive officers of the company and the positions or offices with

relations item 1a risk factors you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment 9communitys expectations changes in our andor the investment communitys expectations for our future results and other factors many of which are beyond our control cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performancesemiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue the semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations and on the market price of our securities the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or if this market or key endequipment markets grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects our margins may vary over timeour profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in our shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of manufacturing capacity and can adversely affect profit margins as a result the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and productsour results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product life cycles moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured as a result there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products there also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market will be wellreceived by customers nor that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressureswe face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual propertyaccess to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims with regard to our own intellectual property we actively enforce and protect our rights however there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our protected technologywe benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally 10consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements a decline in demand in certain markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operationsour customer base includes companies in a wide range of markets but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the personal electronics market particularly the mobile phone sector and from sales to industrial customers decline in one of these markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition our global operations subject us to complex laws regulations and policies and risks associated with international political economic or other conditionswe have facilities in 35 countries worldwide about 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states in particular shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue our global operations subject us to complex us and foreign laws regulations and policies relating to for example trade and export controls antibribery antitrust and privacy violations of or changes in these laws regulations and policies could result in fines penalties and sanctions that could adversely affect our results of operations operating internationally also exposes us to political and economic conditions security risks health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results additionally in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditionour results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operatewe have manufacturing data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers have similar facilities and operations in such locations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our results and financial conditionthe loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operationswe generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionour results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors promotion of competing product lines or our distributors financial performancein 2013 about 55 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products to distributors our distributors carry competing product lines and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products moreover our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to usour results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventorywe have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and for some distributors if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ticonsigned inventory our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer distributor or insurer or if our recovery is delayed11incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operationsour ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarters revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionour performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials utilities critical manufacturing equipment manufacturing processes and thirdparty manufacturing servicesour manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment and those of some of our customers and suppliers require that certain key raw materials natural resources and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree additionally our costs may increase if customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflictfreeour inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits we also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development a limited number of third parties perform these functions and we do not have longterm contracts with all of them reliance on these third parties involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand the third parties inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on usour results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matterswe have facilities in 35 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change our operations could be affected by changes in environmental safety and health laws and regulationswe are subject to environmental safety and health laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate our business particularly those in which we manufacture our products if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business particularly if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products there can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available or be available at reasonable cost our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial marketswe maintain bank accounts one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our daily operations invest in our business make strategic acquisitions and service our debt obligations requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of 12operations and financial condition could be adversely affected similarly such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments if our customers or suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technologymaterial impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operationscharges associated with impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit the review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill a decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from among other things unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill most of our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives but they are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair valueour results of operations could be affected by warranty claims product recalls or product liabilitywe could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards or settlements in the event of a warranty claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part in such instances we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environmentour continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we requireour debt could affect our operations and financial conditionfrom time to time we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and business and other factors affecting our operations including the other risk factors described under item 1a many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or cause us to raise funds through such means as the issuance of new debt or equity or the disposition of assetsour ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operationsfrom time to time we undertake business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions to support or carry out our strategic objectives our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results for example we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations product lines and technology and our preacquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition further we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations13our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches of our information technology systemsbreaches of our information technology systems caused by computer viruses unauthorized access sabotage vandalism or terrorism could compromise our information technology networks and result in unauthorized release of our our customers or our suppliers confidential or proprietary information cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations result
