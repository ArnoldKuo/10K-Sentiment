semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in 35 countries we have two reportable segments analog and embedded processing we report the results of our remaining business activities in other we expect analog and embedded processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead and we therefore focus our resources on these segments in 2014 we generated 1305 billion of revenueproduct informationsemiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors generally known as chips combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit we have tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment we sell catalog and applicationspecific standard semiconductor products both of which we market to multiple customers catalog products are designed for use by many customers andor many applications and are sold through both distribution and direct channels the life cycles of catalog products generally span multiple years with some products continuing to sell for decades after their initial release applicationspecific standard products assps are designed for use by a smaller number of customers and are targeted to a specific application the life cycles of assps are generally determined by endequipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months although some can be used across multiple generations of customers products the vast majority of our revenue is derived from products that are differentiated from competitors products our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results additional information regarding each segment followsanaloganalog generated 81 billion of revenue in 2014 analog semiconductors change realworld signals such as sound temperature pressure or images by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as embedded processors analog semiconductors also are used to manage power in every electronic device whether plugged into a wall or running off a battery our analog products are used in many markets particularly personal electronics and industrialsales of our analog products generated 62 percent of our revenue in 2014 according to external sources the market for analog semiconductors was 44 billion in 2014 our analog segments revenue in 2014 was 18 percent of this fragmented market the leading position we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time our analog segment includes the following product lines high volume analog amp

products that we acquired through our purchase of national semiconductor corporation national in 2011embedded processingembedded processing generated 27 billion of revenue in 2014 embedded processing products are the brains of many electronic devices embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance power and cost depending on the application the devices vary from simple lowcost products used in electric toothbrushes to highly specialized complex devices used in communications infrastructure equipment our embedded processing products are used in many markets particularly industrial and automotivean important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rampd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the nextsales of embedded processing products generated 21 percent of our revenue in 2014 according to external sources the market for embedded processors was 18 billion in 2014 we held the number two position which represented 15 percent of this fragmented market we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over timeour embedded processing segment includes the following major product lines processor microcontrollers and connectivity processor productsthese include digital signal processors dsps and applications processors dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data applications processors are typically tailored for a specific class of applications such as communications infrastructure and automotive infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems they are also sold into broad industrial applicationsmicrocontroller productsthese include selfcontained systems with a processor core memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory and program length with no operating system and low software complexity analog components that control or interface with sensors and other systems are often integrated into microcontrollers connectivity productsthese include products that enable electronic devices to seamlessly connect and transfer data and the requirements for speed data capability distance power and security vary depending on the application our connectivity products support many wireless technologies to meet these requirements including lowpower wireless network standards like zigbee and other technologies like bluetooth wifi and gps our connectivity products are usually designed into customer devices alongside our processor and microcontroller products enabling data to be collected transmitted and acted uponotherother generated 22 billion of revenue in 2014 and includesrevenue from our smaller product lines such as dlp products primarily used in projectors to create highdefinition images certain custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics and calculators revenue from our baseband products and from our omaptm applications processors and connectivity products sold into smartphones and consumer tablets our exit from these legacy wireless products was completed in 2013 royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies we also include in other items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments these include acquisitionrelated charges restructuring charges and certain corporatelevel items

designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles maturemarket cyclethe semiconductor cycle refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity these are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle the semiconductor cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities we employ several strategies to dampen the effect of the semiconductor cycle on ti we acquire our facilities and equipment ahead of demand which usually allows us to acquire this capacity at lower costs we focus our resources on our analog and embedded processing segments which serve diverse markets and diverse customers this diversity reduces our dependence on the performance of a single market or small group of customers additionally we utilize consignment inventory programs with our customers and distributors which gives us realtime insight into endmarket demand allowing us to better manage our factory loadingsseasonalityour revenue is subject to some seasonal variation our semiconductor revenue tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared to the second and third quarters calculator revenue is tied to the us backtoschool season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarterscompetitive landscapethe analog and embedded processing markets are highly fragmented as a result we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operatewe believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a companys product line the strength and depth of the sales network technological innovation product development execution technical support customer service quality reliability price and scale the primary competitive factors for our analog products include design proficiency a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance applications and sales support and manufacturing expertise and capacity the primary competitive factors for our embedded processing products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets installed base of software software expertise applications and sales support and a products performance integration and power characteristicsmanufacturingsemiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is packaged and tested the entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks with most products completing within 8 to 16 weeksthe cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by technology our analog products and most of our embedded processing products can be manufactured using mature and stable and therefore less expensive equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced logic products such as some of our processor productswe own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation we own much of our manufacturing capacity therefore a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed when factory loadings decrease our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and absent other circumstances 5our profit margins decrease conversely as factory loadings increase our fixed costs are spread over increased output and absent other circumstances our profit margins increase however our operating focus is more on maximizing longterm free cash flow than minimizing shortterm variations in profit margins caused by factory loadings free cash flow is cash flow from operations less capital expendituresto this end we seek to maximize longterm free cash flow by keeping capital expenditures low through opportunistic purchases of facilities and equipment ahead of demand for example in 2013 we purchased an assemblytest facility in chengdu china in 2014 we initiated plans to adapt existing facilities to manufacture more products including new products using 300millimeter wafers our most costeffective manufacturing process these activities may have nearterm effects on our profit margins but we believe they will result in longterm benefits to free cash flowwe expect to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs to supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital we utilize the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries and subcontractors in 2014 we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40 percent of our assemblytest services from subcontractorsinventoryour inventory practices differ by product but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand we carry proportionally more inventory of products with long life cycles and a broad customer base additionally we sometimes maintain product inventory in unfinished wafer form as well as higher finishedgoods inventory of lowvolume products allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand we also have consignment inventory programs in place for our largest customers and distributorsdesign centers our design centers provide design engineering and product application support as well as aftersales customer service the design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customerscustomerswe estimate that we sell our products to more than 100000 customers our customer base is diverse with onethird of our revenue deriving from customers outside our top 100 in addition no single customer accounts for 10 percent or more of our revenue most of our customers purchase our products through distributorssales and distributionwe market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force and distributors we have sales or marketing offices in 34 countries about 60 percent of our revenue comes through distribution channels our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers they also sell products from our competitors our distribution network holds a mix of ticonsigned and distributorowned inventory over time we expect this mix will continue to shift more toward consignment about 60 percent of our distributor revenue is generated from sales of consigned inventoryacquisitions divestitures and investments from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us in september 2011 we acquired national semiconductor corporationbacklogwe define backlog as of a particular date as purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations further our consignment programs do not result in backlog because the order occurs at the same time as delivery ie when the customer pulls the product from consigned inventory our backlog of orders was 094 billion at december 31 2014 and 106 billion at december 31 20136raw materials we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable futureintellectual property we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiationour semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license certain of our patents to other companies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory termswe own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are texas instruments and our corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include dlpresearch and development our rampd expense was 136 billion in 2014 compared with 152 billion in 2013 and 188 billion in 2012 our primary areas of rampd investment are analog and embedded processing products our rampd has been declining primarily as a result of our decision to wind down investments in legacy wireless products this winddown is now completewe conduct most of our rampd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties including software suppliers universities and select industry consortia and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing

conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment communitys expectations changes in our andor the investment communitys expectations for our future results and other factors many of which are beyond our controlcyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performancesemiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue the semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations and on the market price of our securities our results of operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or if this market or key endequipment markets grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects our margins may vary over timeour profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in our shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings and can adversely affect profit margins as a resultthe markets we serve are characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and productsour results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured so we may not be able to successfully develop and market these new products we do not expect that all of our rampd projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute significant revenue until at least a few years after they are completed further the products we do 8develop and market might not be wellreceived by customers and we might not realize a return on the capital expended to develop such productswe face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressureswe face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate for example the china market is highly competitive and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share additionally we may face increased competition as a result of chinas adoption of policies designed to promote its domestic semiconductor industry certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitorsour performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual propertyaccess to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims with regard to our own intellectual property we actively enforce and protect our rights however there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our protected technologywe benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreementsa decline in demand in certain markets or sectors could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operationsour customer base includes companies in a wide range of markets and sectors within those markets but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the personal electronics and communications equipment markets decline in one or more sectors within these markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition our global operations subject us to risks associated with international political economic or other conditionswe have facilities in 35 countries about 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states in particular shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue operating internationally exposes us to political and economic conditions security risks health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results additionally in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition9our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operatewe have manufacturing data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as health epidemics severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers have similar facilities and operations in such locations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our results and financial conditionthe loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operationswe generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionour results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors promotion of competing product lines or our distributors financial performancein 2014 about 60 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors our distributors carry competing product lines and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products moreover our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to usour results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventorywe have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ticonsigned inventory our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer distributor or insurer or if our recovery is delayedincorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operationsour ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarters revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionour performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials utilities critical manufacturing equipment manufacturing processes and thirdparty manufacturing servicesour manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment and those of some of our customers and suppliers require that certain key raw materials natural resources and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree additionally our costs may increase if customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflictfreeour inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products we also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development a limited number of third parties perform these functions and we do not have longterm contracts with all of them reliance on these third parties involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand the third parties inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us10our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matterswe have facilities in 35 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will changewe have not made a provision for us income tax on the portion of our undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries that is considered permanently reinvested outside the united states if in the future we repatriate any of these foreign earnings we might incur incremental us income tax which could affect our results of operationsour operations could be affected by the complex laws rules and regulations to which our business is subjectwe are subject to complex laws rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to for example environmental safety and health exports and imports bribery and corruption tax data privacy labor and employment competition and intellectual property ownership and infringement compliance with these laws rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business could be restricted and we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws rules and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business some of these complex laws rules and regulations  for example those related to environmental safety and health requirements  may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products especially if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products there can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available or be available at reasonable costour results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial marketswe maintain bank accounts one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our daily operations invest in our business make strategic acquisitions service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected similarly such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments if our customers or suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technologymaterial impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operationscharges associated with impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit the review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including

operations16item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsoverviewwe design make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world our business model is carefully constructed around several advantages that are unique to tiindustrys broadest portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors   our customers design engineers need at least one and most times multiple chips for their systems the breadth of our portfolio means we can solve more of these needs than can our competitors which gives us access to more customers and the opportunity to generate more revenue per system we invest more than 1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolioa strong foundation of manufacturing technology and lowcost production we invest in manufacturing technologies that differentiate the features of our semiconductors and we do most of our own production inhouse as opposed to outsourcing it this ability to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers we produce billions of semiconductors each year on a mixture of 150 200 and 300millimeter wafers and we are able to keep costs low for manufacturing facilities and equipment because our analog and much of our embedded processing semiconductors can be made using mature assets that we acquire ahead of demand when their prices are most attractive in 2014 we produced approximately 25 percent of our analog semiconductors on 300millimeter wafers the industrys largest wafers which have a 40 percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200millimeter wafers the majority of our future analog growth will be produced on 300millimeter wafers which will be meaningful to the growth of our margins and cash flow over the long termindustrys largest market channels our global sales force is larger than those of our competitors and the breadth of our portfolio attracts tens of millions of visits to our web site each year where customers often begin their initial product searches and designin journey these capabilities combine to provide us unique access to more than 100000 customersdiversity and longevity in our products and in the markets we serve together the advantages above result in diverse and longlived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders because of the breadth of our portfolio we are not dependent on any single product and because of the breadth of our markets we are not dependent on any single application or customer some of our products generate revenue for decades which strengthens the return on our investmentsthese advantages have resulted in consistent share gains and free cash flow growth and they put us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow generate cash and return that cash to shareholders managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mdampa should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document in the following discussion of our results of operationsall dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of us dollars except pershare amountswhen we discuss our resultsunless otherwise noted changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes new products tend not to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of productsfrom time to time our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higherpriced or lowerpriced products which we refer to as changes in the mix of products shippedbecause we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed when factory loadings decrease our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and absent other circumstances our profit margins decrease conversely as factory loadings increase our fixed costs are spread over increased output and absent other circumstances our profit margins increase increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand17our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels and how management allocates resources and measures results see note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segmentsour exit from legacy wireless products and the elimination effective january 1 2013 of the wireless segment resulted in changes to our corporatelevel expense allocations which negatively affected analog and embedded processing profitability in the year ended december 31 2013 and to a less significant extent in 2014 we allocate our corporatelevel expenses which are largely fixed among our product lines in proportion to the operating expenses directly generated by them legacy wireless products generated lower operating expenses in 2014 and 2013 than in 2012 because we stopped investing in them the corporatelevel expenses allocated to those products were therefore proportionately lower and the corporatelevel expenses allocated to the remaining product lines were proportionately higher this allocation change affects the profitability of each of our segments but does not impact operating expense or profitability trends at the consolidated levelresults of operationswe continued to perform well in 2014 reflecting our focus on analog and embedded processing semiconductors we believe these products serve highly diverse markets with thousands of applications and have dependable longterm growth opportunities in 2014 analog revenue grew 13 percent and embedded processing revenue grew 12 percent these two segments represented 83 percent of ti revenue for the year up from 79 percent in 2013 gross margin of 569 percent for the year reflects the diversity and longevity of our product portfolio as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy our business model focused on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations in 2014 free cash flow was 27 percent of revenue up 3 percentage points from a year ago during the year we returned 42

revenue compared with 521 percent in 2013 operating expenses were 136 billion for rampd and 184 billion for sgampa rampd expense decreased 164 million or 11 percent from 2013 primarily due to savings

future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans we plan to contribute about 100 million in 2015 but funding projections beyond 2015 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions and the impact from the plans asset performance interest rates and potential us and nonus legislation critical accounting policiesin preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we use statistical analyses estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and may vary from actual results we consider the following accounting policies to be both those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections there could be a significant effect on our financial statementsrevenue recognitionwe recognize revenue from sales of our products including direct sales to our distributors when title and risk of loss pass which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor depending upon the terms of the sales order when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists when sales amounts are fixed or determinable and when collectability is reasonably assured for sales to distributors payment is due on our standard commercial terms and is not contingent upon resale of the products in 2014 about 60 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products to distributorswe recognize revenue net of allowances which are managements estimates of future credits to be granted to customers or distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry these allowances are based on analysis of historical data current economic conditions and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized allowances may include volumebased incentives product returns due to quality issues incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities and special pricing arrangements for instance we sell to distributors at standard published prices but we may grant them price adjustment credits in response to individual competitive opportunities to estimate allowances we use statistical percentages of revenue which are determined quarterly based upon recent historical adjustment trends historical claims data are maintained for each of the programs with differences among geographic regions taken into consideration we continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in distributor revenue and inventory levels allowances are also adjusted when recent historical data do not represent anticipated future activity we may also provide distributors an allowance to scrap certain slowselling or obsolete products in their inventory estimated as a negotiated fixed percentage of each distributors purchases from us in addition if we publish a new price for a product that is lower than that paid by distributors for the same product still remaining in each distributors onhand inventory we may credit 23them for the difference between those prices the allowance for this type of credit is based on the identified product price difference applied to our estimate of each distributors onhand inventory of that productwe believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements including consignment arrangements with distributors is recognized in accordance with the principles discussed above but delivery occurs when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations about 60 percent of our distributor revenue is generated from sales of consigned inventory the allowances we record against this revenue are not materialwe determine the amount and timing of royalty revenue based on our contractual agreements with intellectual property licensees we recognize royalty revenue when earned under the terms of the agreements and when we consider realization of payment to be probable in addition we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected we monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging when collection is at risk we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and if necessary will record a charge in the period such determination is made we include amounts received from customers for reimbursement of shipping fees in revenue we include the costs of shipping and handling in cor income taxesin determining net income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expensein the ordinary course of global business there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due although we believe the estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accrualsas part of our financial process we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not likely the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks and taxable income in future years our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors including changes in us or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods these changes if any may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made also our plans for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain of our nonus operations could change such changes could have a material effect on tax expense in future years in addition to the factors described above the effective tax rate reflected in forwardlooking statements is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes in tax law enacted during the year could affect these estimates retroactive changes in tax law enacted subsequent to the end of a reporting period are reflected in the period of enactment as a discrete tax item inventory valuation allowancesinventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials workinprocess and finished goods statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and workinprocess based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons for finished goods quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold a specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance examples are an endoflife part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of market prices for those products actual future writeoffs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand customer negotiations technology shifts and other factors24impairment of acquisitionrelated intangibles and goodwillwe review acquisitionrelated intangible assets for impairment when certain indicators suggest an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable factors considered include the assets underperformance compared with expectations and shortened useful life due to planned changes in its use recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over fair value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique additionally in the case of an intangible asset that will continue to be used in future periods a shortened useful life may be utilized if appropriate resulting in accelerated amortization based upon the expected net realizable value of the asset at the date the asset will no longer be utilizedwe review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise such as significant changes in business climate operating performance or competition or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates this impairment review compares the fair value for each reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions we base our fairvalue estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonableactual cash flow amounts for future periods may differ from estimates used in impairment testingchanges in accounting standardssee note 2 to the financial statements for

exchange riskthe us dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting our nonus entities own assets or liabilities denominated in us dollars or other currencies exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdictions and consequently on our effective tax rateour balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from nonus dollar currencies because most of the aggregate nonus dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts based on yearend 2014 balances and currency exchange rates a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in nonus currency exchange rates would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of less than 1 millionwe use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures for example at yearend 2014 we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of 504 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures including 183 million to sell japanese yen 163 million to sell euros and 29 million to sell british pound sterling similar hedging activities existed at yearend 2013interest rate riskwe have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates 1 the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments which could produce a gain or a loss and 2 the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt25as of december 31 2014 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments by 12 million and decrease the fair value of our longterm debt by 128 million because interest rates on our longterm debt are fixed changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with longterm debtequity risklongterm investments at yearend 2014

longterm investments specific details are as followscash equivalents and shortterm investments we consider investments in debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of our investment to be cash equivalents we consider investments in debt securities with maturities beyond 90 days from the date of our investment as being available for use in current operations and include them in shortterm investments the primary objectives of our cash equivalent and shortterm investment activities are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity while generating appropriate returns longterm investments longterm investments consist of mutual funds venture capital funds and nonmarketable equity securities classification of investments depending on our reasons for holding the investment and our ownership percentage we classify our investments as either available for sale trading equity method or cost method which are more fully described in note 9 we determine cost or amortized cost as appropriate on a specific identification basisinventoriesinventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value cost is generally computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis which approximates cost on a firstin firstout basis standard cost is based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed as incurred inventory held at consignment locations is included in our finished goods inventory consigned inventory was 258 million and 202 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively we review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence a statistical allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold the statistical allowance is based on an analysis of historical disposal activity historical customer shipments as well as estimated future sales a specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance we write off inventory in the period in which disposal occursproperty plant and equipment acquisitionrelated intangibles and other capitalized costsproperty plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straightline method our cost basis includes certain assets acquired in business combinations that were initially recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition leasehold improvements are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements we amortize acquisitionrelated intangibles on a straightline basis over the estimated economic life of the assets capitalized software licenses generally are amortized on a straightline basis over the term of the license fully depreciated or amortized assets are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortizationimpairments of longlived assetswe regularly review whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of property plant and equipment or other longlived assets including intangible assets are impaired we assess the recoverability of assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respective carrying amounts any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets fair value is determined by available market valuations if applicable or by discounted cash flowsgoodwill and indefinitelived intangiblesgoodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 for our reporting units which compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated carrying value including goodwill see note 10 for additional information37foreign currencythe functional currency for our nonus subsidiaries is the us dollar accounts recorded in currencies other than the us dollar are remeasured into the functional currency current assets except inventories deferred income taxes other assets current liabilities and longterm liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period property plant and equipment with associated depreciation and inventories are valued at historic exchange rates revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are remeasured at the appropriate daily rate of exchange currency exchange gains and losses from remeasurement are credited or charged to oiampederivatives and hedgingwe use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk these instruments are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts which are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contracts are credited or charged to oiampe we do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instrumentsin connection with the issuance of longterm debt we use financial derivatives such as treasury rate lock agreements that are recognized in aoci and amortized over the life of the related debt the results of these derivative transactions have not been materialwe do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposeschanges in accounting standardsin april 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201408 presentation of financial statements topic 205 and property plant and equipment topic 360 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity this standard raises the threshold at which a disposal qualifies as a discontinued operation under the new guidance only a disposal representing a strategic shift in operations that has or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results such as a disposal of a major geographic area or a major line of business should be presented as discontinued operations in addition the new standard requires additional disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the revised definition of a discontinued operation this standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning as of january 1 2015 in the event that a future disposition meets the revised criteria we expect that this standard will have an impact on the presentation of our financial statements and we will provide the appropriate disclosures at that timein may 2014 the fasb

earnings of our nonus subsidiaries are primarily invested in working capital and property plant and equipment determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability is not practical because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculationcash payments made for income taxes net of refunds were 1104 billion 569 million and 171 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively48uncertain tax positionswe operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any item on these tax returns because the matters challenged by authorities are typically complex their ultimate outcome is uncertain before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements we must determine that it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate tax authorities we recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions

not been made of this liability 52 million relates to the cumulative effect of a tax depreciationrelated method change the balance of this liability is primarily related to transfer pricing issues for which procedures for relief from double taxation will mitigate the tax rate impact of any difference between the actual tax assessments and our estimates about 32 million of the liability represents audit assessments of the liability 29 million is related to transfer pricing issues for which there are ongoing procedures for relief from double taxation settlement of the 29 million is subject to timely completion of the tax treaty processes and a significant portion of that liability may be settled within the next 12 months settlement will not have a significant tax rate impact as the tax

and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date51the threelevel hierarchy discussed below indicates the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fairvalue measurementslevel 1  uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting datelevel 2  uses inputs other than level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models such as interest rates and volatility factors are corroborated by readily observable data we utilize a thirdparty data service to provide level 2 valuations we verify these valuations for reasonableness relative to unadjusted quotes obtained from brokers or dealers based on observable prices for similar assets in active marketslevel 3  uses inputs that are unobservable supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment these values are generally determined using pricing models that utilize management estimates of market participant assumptions the following are our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we had no

descriptionswe have various employee retirement plans including defined contribution defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans for qualifying employees we offer deferred compensation arrangements 53us retirement plansour principal retirement plans in the us are a defined contribution plan an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans the defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997 and current participants were allowed to make a onetime election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan described belowboth defined contribution plans offer an employermatching savings option that allows employees to make pretax contributions to various investment choices including a ti common stock fund employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan where employermatching contributions are provided for up to 2 percent of the employees annual eligible earnings employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after november 1997 and through december 31 2003 may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan this plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2 percent of the employees annual eligible earnings plus an employermatching contribution of up to 4 percent of the employees annual eligible earnings employees hired after december 31 2003 do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2 percent of the employees annual eligible earnings at december 31 2014 and 2013 as a result of employees elections tis us defined contribution plans held shares of ti common stock totaling 14 million shares and 15 million shares valued at 740 million and 678 million respectively dividends paid on these shares for 2014 and 2013 were 19 million and 18 million respectivelyour aggregate expense for the us defined contribution plans was 60 million in 2014 62 million in 2013 and 70 million in 2012the defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits as well as employees and participants who no longer accrue servicerelated benefits but instead may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based upon years of service and the highest five consecutive years of compensation we intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements of applicable local laws and regulations plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate the nonqualified defined benefit plans are unfunded and closed to new participants us retiree health care benefit planus employees who meet eligibility requirements are offered medical coverage during retirement we make a contribution toward the cost of those retiree medical benefits for certain retirees and their dependents the contribution rates are based upon various factors the most important of which are an employees date of hire date of retirement years of service and eligibility for medicare benefits the balance of the cost is borne by the plans participants employees hired after january 1 2001 are responsible for the full cost of their medical benefits during retirementnonus retirement planswe provide retirement coverage for nonus employees as required by local laws or to the extent we deem

established at the discretion of each employer employers and employees are exempt from contributing to the japanese pension insurance jpi if the substitutional portion is funded by an epfthe jwpil was amended to permit each epf to separate the substitutional portion and transfer those obligations and related assets to the government of japan after such a transfer the employer is required to contribute periodically to jpi and the government of japan is responsible for future benefit payments relating to the substitutional portionduring the third quarter of 2012 our epf received final approval for such a separation and transferred the obligations and assets of its substitutional portion to the government of japan on a pretax basis this resulted in a net gain of 144 million recorded in restructuring chargesother on our consolidated statements of income and included in other as shown in note 4 this net gain of 144 million consisted of two parts  a gain of 337 million representing

better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan assets and liabilities the appropriate mix of equity and bond investments is determined primarily through the use of detailed assetliability modeling studies that look to balance the impact of changes in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost most of our plans around the world have a greater proportion of fixed income securities with return characteristics that are more closely aligned with changes in the liabilities caused by discount rate volatility for the us plans we utilize an option collar strategy to reduce the volatility of returns on investments in us equity funds the only level 3 assets in our worldwide benefit plans for the periods presented are private equity limited

bonds the selected portfolio is designed to provide cash flows sufficient to pay the plans expected benefit payments when due the resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bonds for our nonus locations with a sufficient number of actively traded highquality bonds an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds available in each country in this manner a present value is developed the discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value for countries that lack a sufficient corporate bond market a government bond index adjusted for an appropriate risk premium
