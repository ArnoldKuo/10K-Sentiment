manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in more than 35 countries we have four segments analog embedded processing wireless and other we expect analog and embedded processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead and we therefore focus our resources on these segmentswe were the worlds fourth largest semiconductor company in 2012 as measured by revenue according to preliminary estimates from an external sourcefinancial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the united states is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned segment and geographic area data in tis 2012 annual report to stockholders it is incorporated herein by reference to such annual reportproduct informationsemiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors come in two basic forms individual transistors and integrated circuits generally known as chips that combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit our products more than 100000 orderable parts are integrated circuits that are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipmentwe sell catalog and to a lesser extent custom semiconductor products catalog products are designed for use by many customers andor many applications and are sold through both distribution and direct channels the majority of our catalog products are proprietary but some are commodity products the life cycles of catalog products generally span multiple years with some products continuing to sell for decades after their initial release custom products are designed for a specific customer for a specific application are sold only to that customer and are typically sold directly to the customer the life cycles of custom products are generally determined by endequipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels and how management allocates resources and measures results additional information regarding each segments products followsanalog analog semiconductors change realworld signals  such as sound temperature pressure or images  by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as digital signal processors dsps analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in every electronic device whether plugged into a wall or running off a battery we estimate that we sell our analog products to more than 100000 customers these sales generated about 55 percent of our revenue in 2012 according to external sources the worldwide market for analog semiconductors was about 39 billion in 2012 our analog segments revenue in 2012 was about 70 billion or about 18 percent of this fragmented market the leading position we believe that we are well positioned to increase our market share over timeour analog segment includes the following major product lines high volume analog amp logic hval power management power high performance analog hpa and silicon valley analog svahval products these include both highvolume analog and logic products highvolume analog includes integrated analog products for specific applications including custom products end markets for highvolume analog products include communications automotive computing and many consumer electronics products logic includes some commodity products marketed to many different customers for many different applicationspower products these include both catalog and applicationspecific products that help customers manage power in any type of electronic system we design and manufacture power management semiconductors for both portable devices 3batterypowered devices such as handheld consumer electronics laptop computers and cordless power tools and linepowered systems products that require an external electrical source such as computers digital tvs wireless basestations and highvoltage industrial equipmenthpa products these include catalog analog products such as amplifiers data converters and interface semiconductors that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets including the industrial communications computing and consumer electronics markets hpa products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years sva products these consist of products that we acquired through our purchase of national semiconductor corporation national in 2011 these include power management data converter interface and operational amplifier catalog analog products nearly all of which are complementary to our other analog products this portfolio of thousands of products is marketed to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets sva products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 yearsembedded processingour embedded processing products include our dsps and microcontrollers dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data microcontrollers are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment sales of embedded processing products generated about 15 percent of our revenue in 2012 according to external sources the worldwide market for embedded processors was about 17 billion in 2012 our embedded processing segments revenue in 2012 was about 20 billion this was the number two position and represented about 12 percent of this fragmented market we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over timean important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rampd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next we make and sell catalog embedded processing products used in many different applications and applicationspecific embedded processing products used in communications infrastructure equipment and automotive applications wirelessduring 2012 our wireless products consisted of omaptm applications processors connectivity products and baseband products we concentrated our wireless investments on omap applications processors and connectivity products for the smartphone and consumer tablet markets sales of wireless products generated about 14 billion or about 11 percent of our revenue for 2012 of which omap and connectivity products represented about 11 billion we had 03 billion in revenue from baseband products a product line that we have previously announced we are exiting in november 2012 we announced that we would restructure our wireless business to focus investments on embedded markets with greater potential for sustainable growth specifically we now focus our omap applications processors and connectivity products on embedded applications with long life cycles instead of on the smartphone and consumer tablet markets where large customers are increasingly developing their own custom chips these changes will result in lower resource and investment demands and as we have previously announced elimination of the wireless segment embedded omap applications processors which often use a standard operating system such as android linux qnx or windows are used in applications that are multifunction need a graphically intensive user interface and often are connected to the internet embedded connectivity products include lowpower wireless network standards like zigbee and other technologies such as bluetooth wifi gps and near field communications both of these product lines have many of the same characteristics as those in our embedded processing segment and will be reported in that segment beginning with our firstquarter 2013 financial report in 2012 sales of these products were about 150 million we expect our revenue from omap and connectivity products sold into smartphone and consumer tablet applications to decline rapidly in 2013 and to substantially cease by the end of the year we also expect baseband revenue to be essentially zero in 2013 beginning with our firstquarter 2013 financial report financial results for wireless products for the smartphone and consumer tablet markets will be included in other4otherother includes revenue from our smaller product lines such as dlp primarily used in projectors to create highdefinition images custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics and calculators it also includes royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies and revenue from transitional supply agreements related to acquisitions and divestitures other generated about 25 billion or about 19 percent of our revenue in 2012 we also include in other certain acquisitionrelated charges that are not used in evaluating results of and allocating resources to our analog embedded processing and wireless segments these charges include certain fairvalue adjustments restructuring charges transaction expenses acquisitionrelated retention bonuses and amortization of intangible assets other also includes certain

softwareothermarket characteristicsproduct cyclethe global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature market cyclethe semiconductor cycle is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing 6capacity these are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle the semiconductor cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilitiesseasonalityour revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation our semiconductor sales generally are seasonally weaker in the first and fourth quarters and stronger in the second and third quarters as manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling seasons calculator revenue is tied to the us backtoschool season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarterscompetitive landscapein each segment we face significant global competition from numerous large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a companys product line the strength and depth of the sales network technological innovation technical support customer service quality reliability price and scale the primary competitive factors for our analog products include design proficiency a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance applications and sales support and manufacturing expertise and capacity our primary analog competitors include analog devices inc fairchild semiconductor corporation freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc nxp semiconductors nv qualcomm incorporated richtek technology corporation and stmicroelectronics nvthe primary competitive factors for our embedded processing products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets installed base of software software expertise applications and sales support and a products performance and power characteristics primary competitors of our embedded processing segment include atmel corporation freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag microchip technology inc nxp semiconductors nv renesas electronics corporation and stmicroelectronics nvthe primary competitive factors for our wireless products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets software expertise applications support and a products performance and power characteristics primary wireless competitors include broadcom corp csr plc intel corporation marvell technology group ltd nvidia corporation qualcomm incorporated and samsung lsi manufacturing semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is tested the wafer is cut into individual units and each unit is assembled into a package that then is usually retested the entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks with most products completing within 8 to 16 weeksthe cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by technology our analog products and most of our embedded processing products can be manufactured using mature and stable and therefore less expensive equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced cmos logic products such as our wireless productswe own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of capacity potentially hurting our profit margins conversely as product demand rises and factory utilization increases the fixed costs are spread over increased output potentially benefiting our profit margins we expect to maintain sufficient internal wafer fabrication capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs to supplement our internal wafer fabrication capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital our wafer manufacturing strategy utilizes the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries and subcontractors in 2012 we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers and about 75 percent of our advanced cmos logic needs from external foundries 7in 2011 we initiated closure of an older wafer fabrication facility in hiji japan and another in houston texas we expect to complete these plant closures in 2013inventoryour inventory practices differ by product but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand because of the longer product life cycles of catalog products and their inherently lower risk of obsolescence we generally carry more inventory of those products than custom products additionally we sometimes maintain catalogproduct inventory in unfinished wafer form as well as higher finishedgoods inventory of lowvolume products allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand we also have consignment inventory programs in place for our largest customers and some distributorsdesign centers our design centers provide design engineering and product application support as well as aftersales customer service the design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers customers our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems original design manufacturers odms contract manufacturers and distributors an oem designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures inhouse or has manufactured by others an odm designs and manufactures products for other companies which then sell those products under their own brand in 2012 no single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our revenue sales and distribution we market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force distributors and authorized thirdparty sales representatives we have sales or marketing offices in 34 countries worldwide and have expanded our sales networks in the emerging markets of china india and eastern europe over the last few years distributors located around the world account for about 50 percent of our revenue our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers they also sell products from our competitors our distribution network holds a mix of distributorowned and ticonsigned inventory over time we expect this mix will shift more toward consignment we sell our calculator products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers acquisitions divestitures and investments from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us in september 2011 we acquired national semiconductor corporationbacklog we define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be under certain circumstances subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations accordingly our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period our backlog of orders was 117 billion at december 31 2012 and 139 billion at december 31 2011raw materials we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 8intellectual property we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiationour semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are texas instruments and our corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include omaptm and dlp research and development our rampd expense was 188 billion in 2012 compared with 172 billion in 2011 and 157 billion in 2010 our primary areas of rampd investment were analog embedded processing and wireless products as announced in november 2012 we are discontinuing future investments in wireless omap processors and connectivity solutions for smartphones and consumer tabletswe conduct most of our rampd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties including software suppliers universities and select external industry consortia and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology from time to time we may terminate rampd projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product we do not expect that all of our rampd projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute significant revenue until at least a few years following completion executive officers of the registrantthe following is an alphabetical list of the names and ages of the

securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment communitys expectations changes in our andor the investment communitys expectations for our future results and other factors many of which are beyond our control cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performancesemiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue the semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations and on the market price of our securities the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or if this market or key endequipment markets grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects our margins may vary over timeour profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in our shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of manufacturing capacity and can adversely affect profit margins as a result the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and productsour results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product life cycles moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured 10as a result there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products there also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers nor that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressureswe face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual propertyaccess to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims with regard to our own intellectual property we actively enforce and protect our rights however there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our protected technologywe benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operationsour customer base includes companies in a wide range of enduser markets but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications and computerrelated industries and from sales to industrial customers within these enduser markets a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to customers in the cell phone personal computer and communications infrastructure markets decline in one or several of these enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition our global operations subject us to risks associated with legal political economic or other changeswe have facilities in more than 35 countries worldwide about 90 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states in particular shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies as well as political and economic conditions security risks health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results additionally in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 11our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operatewe have manufacturing data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers have similar facilities and operations in such locations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our results and financial condition the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operationswhile we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operationsour ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarters revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials utilities critical manufacturing equipment manufacturing processes and thirdparty manufacturing servicesour manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment and those of some of our customers and suppliers require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations additionally the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits we also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development a limited number of third parties perform these functions and we do not have longterm contracts with all of them reliance on these third parties involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand the third parties inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matterswe have facilities in more than 35 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change our operations could be affected by changes in environmental safety and health laws and regulationswe are subject to environmental safety and health laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate our business particularly those in which we manufacture our products if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business particularly if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing 12processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products there can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available or be available at reasonable cost our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial marketswe maintain bank accounts one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our daily operations invest in our business make strategic acquisitions and service our debt obligations requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected similarly such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments if our customers or suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technologymaterial impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operationscharges associated with impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit the review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill a decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from among other things unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill most of our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives but they are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair valueour results of operations could be affected by warranty claims product recalls or product liabilitywe could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards the risk of a significant claim is generally greater for products used in health and safety applications in the event of a warranty claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part in such instances we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environmentour continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require our debt could affect our operations and financial conditionfrom time to time we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and business and other factors affecting our operations including the other risk factors described under item 1a many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or cause us to raise funds through such means as the issuance of new debt or equity or the disposition of assets13our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operationsfrom time to time we undertake business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions to support or carry out our strategic objectives our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results for example we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations product lines and technology and our preacquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition further we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectationsour operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches of our information technology systemswe may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems caused by computer viruses unauthorized access sabotage vandalism or terrorism compromise of our information technology networks could result in unauthorized release of our our customers or our suppliers confidential or proprietary information cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations or result in release of employee personal data any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our
