proxy statement for the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders              part i     item 1  business   we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries we have two reportable segments analog and embedded processing we report the results of our remaining business activities in other in 2015 we generated 13 billion of revenue   we focus our resources on analog and embedded processing because we believe that these segments long product life cycles intrinsic diversity and need for less capitalintensive manufacturing provide a combination of stability profitability and strong cash generation this business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term free cash flow is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures   product information   semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors generally known as chips combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit we have tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment   we sell catalog and applicationspecific standard semiconductor products both of which we market to multiple customers catalog products are designed for use by many customers andor many applications the life cycles of catalog products generally span multiple years with some products continuing to sell for decades after their initial release applicationspecific standard products assps are designed for use by a smaller number of customers and are targeted to a specific application the life cycles of assps are generally determined by endequipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months although some can be used across multiple generations of customers products we also sell custom semiconductor products which are designed for a specific customer to use in a specific application and are sold only to that customer the vast majority of our revenue is derived from products that are differentiated from competitors products our products are sold through distribution channels and directly to customers   our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results additional information regarding each segment follows   analog   analog generated 83 billion of revenue in 2015 analog semiconductors change realworld signals such as sound temperature pressure or images by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as embedded processors analog semiconductors also are used to manage power in every electronic device by converting distributing storing discharging isolating and measuring electrical energy whether the device is plugged into a wall or running off a battery our analog products are used in many markets particularly personal electronics and industrial    sales of our analog products generated about 64 percent of our revenue in 2015 according to external sources the market for analog semiconductors was 45 billion in 2015 our analog segments revenue in 2015 was 18 percent of this fragmented market the leading position we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time   our analog segment includes the following major product lines high volume analog amp logic hval power management power high performance analog hpa and silicon valley analog sva   hval these include highvolume integrated assps and highvolume catalog products hval products support applications like automotive safety devices touchscreen controllers lowvoltage motor drivers and integrated motor controllers   2    power these include both catalog products and assps that help customers manage power in electronic systems our broad portfolio of power products is designed to enhance the efficiency of powered devices using battery management solutions portable power devices power supply controls and pointofload products   hpa these include catalog products that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products hpa products include highspeed data converters amplifiers sensors highreliability products interface products and precision products that are typically used in systems that require high performance hpa products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years   sva these include a broad portfolio of industrial highvoltage power management data converter interface and operational amplifier catalog products used in manufacturing a wide range of electronic systems sva products support applications like video and data interface products high voltage power conversion and mobile lighting and display systems sva products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years sva consists primarily of products that we acquired through our purchase of national semiconductor corporation in 2011   embedded processing   embedded processing generated 28 billion of revenue in 2015 embedded processing products are the brains of many electronic devices embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance power and cost depending on the application the devices vary from simple lowcost products used in electric toothbrushes to highly specialized complex devices used in automotive applications such as infotainment systems and advanced driver assistance systems adas our embedded processing products are used in many markets particularly industrial and automotive   an important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rampd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next    sales of embedded processing products generated about 21 percent of our revenue in 2015 according to external sources the market for embedded processors was 18 billion in 2015 our 15 percent share of this fragmented market is among the leaders we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time    our embedded processing segment includes the following major product lines microcontrollers processors and connectivity   microcontrollers these include selfcontained systems with a processor core memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory and program length with no operating system and low software complexity analog components that control or interface with sensors and other systems are often integrated into microcontrollers   processors these include digital signal processors dsps and applications processors dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data processors are typically tailored for a specific class of applications such as industrial factory automation or grid infrastructure and automotive infotainment and adas they are also sold into broad industrial applications   connectivity these include products that enable electronic devices to seamlessly connect and transfer data and the requirements for speed data capability distance power and security vary depending on the application our connectivity products support many wireless technologies to meet these requirements including lowpower wireless network standards like zigbee and other technologies like  3    bluetooth wifi and gps our connectivity products are usually designed into customer devices alongside our processor and microcontroller products enabling data to be collected transmitted and acted upon   other   we report the results of our remaining business activities in other which generated 19 billion of revenue in 2015 and includes            revenue from our smaller product lines such as dlp products primarily used in projectors to create highdefinition images calculators and certain custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics            royalties received from agreements involving license rights to our patent portfolio    we also include in other items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments examples of these items include acquisition charges restructuring charges revenue from our legacy wireless products and certain corporatelevel items such as litigation expenses environmental costs insurance settlements and gains and losses from other activities including asset dispositions

of ti revenue           5    market characteristics competitive landscape the analog and embedded processing markets are highly fragmented as a result we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate    we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a companys product line the strength and depth of the sales network technological innovation product development execution technical support customer service quality reliability price and scale the primary competitive factors for our analog products include design proficiency a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance applications and sales support and manufacturing expertise and capacity the primary competitive factors for our embedded processing products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets installed base of software software expertise applications and sales support and a products performance integration and power characteristics   product cycle the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature   market cycle the semiconductor cycle refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity these are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle the semiconductor cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities   we employ several strategies to dampen the effect of the semiconductor cycle on ti we acquire our facilities and equipment ahead of demand which usually allows us to acquire this capacity at lower costs we focus our resources on our analog and embedded processing segments which serve diverse markets and diverse customers this diversity reduces our dependence on the performance of a single market or small group of customers additionally we utilize consignment inventory programs with our customers and distributors    seasonality our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation historically our semiconductor revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared to the second and third quarters calculator revenue is tied to the us backtoschool season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarters   manufacturing   semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is packaged and tested the entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks with most products completing within 7 to 16 weeks   the cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by technology our analog products and most of our embedded processing products can be manufactured using mature and stable and therefore less expensive equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced logic products such as some of our processor products   we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation we own much of our manufacturing capacity therefore a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed and changes in factory loadings can cause shortterm variations in profit margins when factory loadings decrease our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and absent other circumstances our profit margins decrease conversely as factory loadings increase our fixed costs  6    are spread over increased output and absent other circumstances our profit margins increase our operating focus is more on maximizing longterm free cash flow than minimizing shortterm variations in profit margins caused by factory loadings   to this end we seek to maximize longterm free cash flow by keeping capital expenditures low through opportunistic purchases of facilities and equipment ahead of demand for example in 2013 we purchased an assemblytest facility in chengdu china in 2015 we began production at an existing facility in dallas texas that we adapted to manufacture analog products using 300millimeter wafers our most costeffective manufacturing process these activities may have nearterm effects on our profit margins but we believe they will result in longterm benefits to free cash flow   we expect to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs to supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital we utilize the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries and subcontractors in 2015 we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40 percent of our assemblytest services from subcontractors   customers   we estimate that we sell our products to more than 100000 customers our customer base is diverse with onethird of our revenue deriving from customers outside our largest 100 our largest single end customer in 2015 was apple inc apple accounted for approximately 11 percent of revenue recognized primarily in our analog segment   sales and distribution   we market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force and distributors we have sales or marketing offices in more than 30 countries about 60 percent of our revenue comes through distribution channels our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers they also sell products from our competitors   inventory   our inventory practices differ by product but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand we carry proportionally more inventory of products with long life cycles and a broad customer base additionally we sometimes maintain product inventory in unfinished wafer form as well as higher finishedgoods inventory of lowvolume products allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand   we generate about 55 percent of our revenue from consignment inventory programs that we have in place for our large customers and distributors with these programs we own inventory that is stored at our customers and distributors locations and we recognize revenue when the product is pulled from consigned inventory these consignment programs give us improved insight into demand allowing us to better manage our factory loadings about 60 percent of our distributor revenue is generated from sales of consigned inventory   backlog   we define backlog as of a particular date as purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations further our consignment programs do not result in backlog because the order occurs at the same time as delivery ie when the customer pulls the product from consigned inventory our backlog of orders was 095 billion at december 31 2015 and 094 billion at december 31 2014   acquisitions divestitures and investments   from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us   7    raw materials   we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future    intellectual property   we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights to our portfolio and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiation our patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business   we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license certain of our patents to other companies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms   we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are texas instruments and our corporate monogram dlp is another valuable trademark   research and development   our rampd expense was 128 billion in 2015 compared with 136 billion in 2014 and 152 billion in 2013 our primary areas of rampd investment are analog and embedded processing products   we conduct most of our rampd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties including software suppliers universities and select industry consortia and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology   executive officers of the registrant   the following is an alphabetical list of the names and ages of the executive

relations       item 1a  risk factors   you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment communitys expectations changes in our andor the investment communitys expectations for our future results and other factors many of which are beyond our control   we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures   we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate for example the china market is highly competitive and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share additionally we may face increased competition as a result of chinas adoption of policies designed to promote its domestic semiconductor industry certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively additionally traditional intellectual property licensors are increasingly providing functionality designs and complete hardware or software solutions that compete with our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors   rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products   rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products we require significant investments to develop new technologies and products that meet changing customer demands and we might not realize a return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured further projects that are commercially viable may not contribute significant revenue until at least a few years after they are completed    changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets if demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or grows at a significantly slower pace than management expects our results of operations may be adversely affected additionally the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 9      our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from for example uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets natural events or domestic or international political social economic or other conditions breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations or a customers inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity   our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarters revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition   our margins may vary over time   our profit margins may be adversely affected by a number of factors including decreases in customer demand and shipment volume obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings and can adversely affect profit margins as a result   cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance   semiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market may lead to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations and on the market price of our securities our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political social economic or other conditions we have facilities in more than 30 countries about 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states in particular shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue we are exposed to political social and economic conditions security risks terrorism or other hostile acts health conditions labor conditions and possible disruptions in transportation communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate any of these could result in an adverse effect on our operations and our financial results additionally in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition   our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate   we have manufacturing data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather geological events or health epidemics that could disrupt operations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations may adversely affect our results and financial condition   we face supply chain and manufacturing risks   we rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a costeffective and timely manner our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected if our suppliers operations were disrupted as a result of for example quality excursions uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets domestic or international political social economic and other conditions natural events in the locations in which our suppliers operate or limited or delayed access to key raw materials natural resources and utilities additionally a breach of our suppliers information technology systems could result in a release of our confidential or proprietary information if our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technology   in particular our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials natural resources and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree additionally our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demands that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflictfree 10      our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development we do not have longterm contracts with all of these suppliers and the number of alternate suppliers is limited reliance on these suppliers involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand suppliers inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of suppliers imposition of increased costs on us   our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches of our information technology systems breaches of our information technology systems could be caused by computer viruses unauthorized access sabotage vandalism or terrorism these breaches could compromise our information technology networks and could result in unauthorized release of our our customers or our suppliers confidential or proprietary information cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations result in release of employee personal data or cause us to incur increased information technology protection costs any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation   our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property   access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims   we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights however there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology moreover the laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws   we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements   our operations could be affected by the complex laws rules and regulations to which our business is subject    we are subject to complex laws rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to for example the environment safety and health exports and imports bribery and corruption tax data privacy and protection labor and employment competition and intellectual property ownership and infringement compliance with these laws rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business could be restricted and we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws rules and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business   some of these complex laws rules and regulations  for example those related to environmental safety and health requirements  may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products especially if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy natural resources or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available or might not be available at reasonable cost   11    our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims product recalls product liability claims or legal proceedings    we could be subject to claims based on warranty product liability epidemic or delivery failures or other grounds relating to our products manufacturing services designs or communications that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards or settlements in the event of a claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part in such instances we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty epidemic failure and delivery claims product recalls or other legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our reputation   our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matters   we have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate if our tax rate increases our results of operations could be adversely affected a number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions changes in available tax credits changes in applicable tax rates or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities   in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change   we have not made a provision for us income tax on the portion of our undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries that is considered permanently reinvested outside the united states if in the future we repatriate any of these foreign earnings we might incur incremental us income tax which could affect our results of operations   our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors promotion of competing product lines or our distributors financial performance   in 2015 about 60 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors our distributors carry competing product lines and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products moreover our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us    our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory   we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ticonsigned inventory our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer distributor or insurer or if our recovery is delayed   our debt could affect our operations and financial condition   from time to time we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and business and other factors affecting our operations including the other risk factors described under item 1a many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders or could cause us to raise funds by for example issuing new debt or equity or selling assets    12    our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets    we maintain bank accounts one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our operations invest in our business make strategic acquisitions service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted   increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition   federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans including the actual return on plan assets discount rates plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding cash flow and results of operations and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans actual experience differs from these assumptions   our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment   our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require   our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations   from time to time we undertake business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions to support or carry out our strategic objectives our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results for example we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations product lines and technology and our preacquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition further we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations    material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations   charges associated with impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit the review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill a decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from among other things unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill most of our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives but they are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value     item 1b  unresolved staff comments not applicable 13

financial condition and results of operations     16        item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  overview we design make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world our business model is carefully constructed around the following attributes          industrys broadest portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors our customers design engineers need at least one and most times multiple chips for their systems the breadth of our portfolio means we can solve more of these needs than can our competitors which gives us access to more customers and the opportunity to generate more revenue per system we invest more than 1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolio          a strong foundation of manufacturing technology and lowcost production we invest in manufacturing technologies that differentiate the features of our semiconductors and we do most of our own production inhouse as opposed to outsourcing it this ability to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers we produce billions of semiconductors each year on a mixture of 150 200 and 300millimeter wafers and we are able to keep costs low for manufacturing facilities and equipment because our analog and much of our embedded processing semiconductors can be made using mature assets that we acquire ahead of demand when their prices are most attractive in 2015 we produced approximately 25 percent of our analog semiconductors on 300millimeter wafers the industrys largest wafers which have a 40 percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200millimeter wafers the majority of our future analog growth will be produced on 300millimeter wafers which will be meaningful to the growth of our margins and cash flow over the long term          industrys largest market channels our global sales force is larger than those of our competitors and the breadth of our portfolio attracts tens of millions of visits to our web site each year where customers often begin their initial product searches and designin journey these capabilities combine to provide us unique access to more than 100000 customers          diversity and longevity in our products and in the markets we serve the attributes above result in diverse and longlived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders because of the breadth of our portfolio we are not dependent on any single product and because of the breadth of our markets we are not dependent on any single application or customer some of our products generate revenue for decades which strengthens the return on our investments  the combined effect of these attributes is that we have consistently grown free cash flow and gained market share in analog and embedded processing these attributes put us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow generate cash and return that cash to shareholders  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mdampa should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document in the following discussion of our results of operations          all dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of us dollars          when we discuss our results        o  unless otherwise noted changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes         o  new products tend not to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products        o  from time to time our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higherpriced or lowerpriced products which we refer to as changes in the mix of products shipped        o  because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed when factory loadings decrease our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and absent other circumstances our profit margins decrease conversely as factory loadings increase our fixed costs are spread over increased output and absent other circumstances our profit margins increase increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand        o  the term legacy wireless products refers to our baseband products omaptm applications processors and connectivity products sold into smartphones and consumer tablets our exit from legacy wireless products was complete in 2013 17             our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels and how management allocates resources and measures results see note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments  results of operations we continued to perform well in 2015 reflecting our focus on analog and embedded processing semiconductors these products serve highly diverse markets with thousands of applications and we believe have dependable longterm growth opportunities in 2015 analog and embedded processing represented 86 percent of revenue up from 83 percent in 2014 gross margin of 582 percent for the year a new record reflects the quality of our product portfolio as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations in 2015 free cash flow also a record was 286 percent of revenue up from 269 percent a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 2030 percent of revenue during the year we returned 42 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure for a reconciliation to gaap and an explanation of the reason for providing this nongaap measure see the nongaap financial information section after the liquidity and capital resources section details of financial results  2015 compared with 2014 revenue of 1300 billion was about even with 2014 as higher revenue from analog and embedded processing was offset by lower revenue from other our 2015 revenue was negatively affected by about 150 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates gross profit was 756 billion an increase of 133 million or 2 percent due to lower manufacturing costs gross profit margin was 582 percent of revenue compared with 569 percent operating expenses were 128 billion for rampd and 175 billion for sgampa rampd expense decreased 78 million or 6 percent and sgampa decreased 95 million or 5 percent both comparisons reflect savings from ongoing efforts across the company to align costs with growth opportunities including the completed restructuring actions in embedded processing and japan these decreases were partially offset by higher compensationrelated costs acquisition charges were related to our 2011 acquisition of national semiconductor and were 329 million about even with 2014 these noncash charges were primarily from the amortization of intangible assets see note 13 to the financial statements restructuring chargesother was a net credit of 71 million which included gains on sales of assets of 83 million that were partially offset by 12 million related to restructuring charges and other credits this compared with a net credit of 51 million in 2014 reflecting gains on sales of assets of 75 million that were partially offset by restructuring charges and other expenses of 24 million these amounts are included in other for segment reporting purposes see note 3 to the financial statements operating profit was 427 billion or 329 percent of revenue compared with 395 billion or 303 percent of revenue the income tax provision was 123 billion compared with 105 billion the increase in the total tax provision was due to higher income before income taxes and to a lesser extent a lower benefit from nonus effective tax rates our annual effective tax rate was 29 percent in 2015 and 27 percent in 2014 see note 6 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the income tax provision to the statutory federal tax net income was 299 billion an increase of 165 million or 6 percent eps was 282 compared with 257 eps benefited 007 due to a lower number of average shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program in the near term for the first quarter of 2016 we expect about a 150 million decline in revenue from the first quarter of 2015 within a sector

revolving credit facility cash flows from operating activities for 2015 was 427 billion an increase of 376 million from 2014 primarily due to an increase in cash provided by working capital our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investmentgrade banks and allows us to borrow up to 2 billion until march 2020 this credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper as of december 31 2015 our credit facility was undrawn and we had no commercial paper outstanding in 2015 investing activities used 302 million compared with 377 million in 2014 for

with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans we plan to contribute about 100 million in 2016 but funding projections beyond 2016 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions and the impact from the plans asset performance interest rates and potential us and nonus legislation  critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we use statistical analyses estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and may vary from actual results we consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections there could be a significant effect on our financial statements  revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of our products including direct sales to our distributors when title and risk of loss pass which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor depending upon the terms of the sales order when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists when sales amounts are fixed or determinable and when collectability is reasonably assured for sales to distributors payment is due on our standard commercial terms and is not contingent upon resale of the products we recognize revenue net of allowances which are managements estimates of future credits to be granted to customers or distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry these allowances are based on analysis of historical data current economic conditions and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized allowances may include volumebased incentives product returns due to quality issues incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities and special pricing arrangements for instance we sell to distributors at standard published prices but we may grant them price adjustment credits in response to individual competitive opportunities to estimate allowances we use statistical percentages of revenue which are determined quarterly based upon recent historical adjustment trends historical claims data are maintained for each of the programs with differences among geographic regions taken into consideration we continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in distributor revenue and inventory levels allowances are also adjusted when recent historical data do not represent anticipated future activity we may also provide distributors an allowance to scrap certain slowselling or obsolete products in their inventory estimated as a negotiated fixed percentage of each distributors purchases from us in addition if we publish a new price for a product that is lower than that paid by distributors for the same product still remaining in each distributors onhand inventory we may credit them for the  22    difference between those prices the allowance for this type of credit is based on the identified product price difference applied to our estimate of each distributors onhand inventory of that product we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements including consignment arrangements with distributors is recognized in accordance with the principles discussed above but delivery occurs when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations we determine the amount and timing of royalty revenue related to licenses of our patent portfolio based on our contractual agreements with licensees we recognize royalty revenue when earned under the terms of the agreements and when we consider realization of payment to be probable in addition we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected we monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging when collection is at risk we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and if necessary will record a charge in the period such determination is made we include amounts received from customers for reimbursement of shipping fees in revenue we include the costs of shipping and handling in cor income taxes in determining net income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in the ordinary course of global business there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due although we believe the estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals as part of our financial process we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not likely the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks and taxable income in future years our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors including changes in us or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods these changes if any may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made also our plans for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain of our nonus operations could change such changes could have a material effect on tax expense in future years in addition to the factors described above the effective tax rate reflected in forwardlooking statements is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes in tax law enacted during the year could affect these estimates retroactive changes in tax law enacted subsequent to the end of a reporting period are reflected in the period of enactment as a discrete tax item inventory valuation allowances inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials workinprocess and finished goods statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and workinprocess based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons for finished goods quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold a specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance examples are an endoflife part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of market prices for those products actual future writeoffs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand customer negotiations technology shifts and other factors 23    changes in accounting standards see note 2 to the financial statements for information on new accounting standards offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2015 we had no significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk commitments and contingencies see note 12 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies     item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk the us dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting our nonus entities own assets or liabilities denominated in us dollars or other currencies exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdictions and consequently on our effective tax rate  our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from nonus dollar currencies because most of the aggregate nonus dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts based on yearend 2015 balances and currency exchange rates a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in nonus currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of less than 1 million we use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures for example at yearend 2015 we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of 464 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures including 175 million to sell japanese yen and 139 million to sell euros similar hedging activities existed at yearend 2014  interest rate risk we have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates 1 the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments which could produce a gain or a loss and 2 the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt  as of december 31 2015 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments by 6 million and decrease the fair value of our longterm debt by 111 million because interest rates on our longterm debt are fixed changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with longterm debt equity risk longterm investments at yearend 2015 include the following           investments in mutual funds  includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements the mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments           investments in venture capital funds  includes investments in limited partnerships accounted for under either the equity or cost method          equity investments  includes nonmarketable nonpublicly traded equity securities investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments fair values would not materially affect operating

consists primarily of products that we acquired through our purchase of national semiconductor corporation national in 2011          embedded processing  consists of the following product lines microcontrollers processors and connectivity we report the results of our remaining business activities in other other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments other includes dlp products calculators custom asics and royalties received from agreements involving license rights to our patent portfolio we also include in other items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments examples of these items include acquisition charges see note 13 restructuring charges see note 3 revenue from our legacy wireless products and certain corporatelevel items such as litigation expenses environmental costs insurance settlements and gains and losses from other activities including asset dispositions we allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount our centralized manufacturing and support organizations such as facilities procurement and logistics provide support to our operating segments including those in other costs incurred by these organizations including depreciation are charged to the segments on a perunit basis consequently depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments results and therefore is not provided the assets and liabilities associated with these organizations are included in other with the exception of goodwill we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information we have no material

presentation and significant accounting policies and practices basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap the basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation all dollar amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes except pershare amounts are stated in millions of us dollars unless otherwise indicated we have reclassified certain amounts in the prior periods financial statements to conform to the 2015 presentation including to apply retrospectively the following          a new standard on classifying deferred income taxes see changes in accounting standards below and note 6 and          a new standard on classifying debt issuance costs see changes in accounting standards below and note 11   the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary 32    significant accounting policies and practices revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of our products including direct sales to our distributors when title and risk of loss pass which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor depending upon the terms of the sales order when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists when sales amounts are fixed or determinable and when collectability is reasonably assured for sales to distributors payment is due on our standard commercial terms and is not contingent upon resale of the products we recognize revenue net of allowances which are managements estimates of future credits to be granted to customers or distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry these allowances are based on analysis of historical data current economic conditions and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized allowances may include volumebased incentives product returns due to quality issues incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities and special pricing arrangements for instance we sell to distributors at standard published prices but we may grant them price adjustment credits in response to individual competitive opportunities to estimate allowances we use statistical percentages of revenue which are determined quarterly based upon recent historical adjustment trends historical claims data are maintained for each of the programs with differences among geographic regions taken into consideration we continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in distributor revenue and inventory levels allowances are also adjusted when recent historical data do not represent anticipated future activity  we may also provide distributors an allowance to scrap certain slowselling or obsolete products in their inventory estimated as a negotiated fixed percentage of each distributors purchases from us in addition if we publish a new price for a product that is lower than that paid by distributors for the same product still remaining in each distributors onhand inventory we may credit them for the difference between those prices the allowance for this type of credit is based on the identified product price difference applied to our estimate of each distributors onhand inventory of that product we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner  revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements including consignment arrangements with distributors is recognized in accordance with the principles discussed above but delivery occurs when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations we determine the amount and timing of royalty revenue related to licenses of our patent portfolio based on our contractual agreements with licensees we recognize royalty revenue when earned under the terms of the agreements and when we consider realization of payment to be probable  in addition we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected we monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging when collection is at risk we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and if necessary will record a charge in the period such determination is made we recognize shipping fees received from customers in revenue and we include the shipping and handling costs in cor advertising costs we expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred this expense was 46 million in 2015 45 million in 2014 and 46 million in 2013 restructuring charges restructuring charges may consist of voluntary or involuntary severancerelated charges assetrelated charges and other costs due to exit activities we recognize voluntary termination benefits when the employee accepts the offered benefit arrangement we recognize involuntary severancerelated charges depending on whether the termination benefits are provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement or under a onetime benefit arrangement if the former we recognize the charges once they are probable and the amounts are estimable if the latter we recognize the charges once the benefits have been communicated to employees  restructuring activities associated with assets are recorded as an adjustment to the basis of the asset not as a liability when we commit to a plan to abandon a longlived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life we accelerate the recognition of depreciation to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life when an asset is held for sale we write down the carrying value to its net realizable value and cease depreciation restructuring actions may be viewed as an impairment indicator requiring testing of the recoverability of intangible assets including goodwill 33    income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach we record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  other assessed taxes some transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales valueadded and excise taxes from our customers these transactions are presented in our consolidated statements of income on a net excluded from revenue basis earnings per share eps unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents such as our restricted stock units rsus are considered to be participating securities and the twoclass method is used for purposes of

our investment to be cash equivalents we consider investments in debt securities with maturities beyond 90 days from the date of our investment as being available for use in current operations and include them in shortterm investments the primary objectives of our cash equivalent and shortterm investment activities are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity while generating appropriate returns          longterm investments longterm investments consist of mutual funds venture capital funds and nonmarketable equity securities 34             classification of investments depending on our reasons for holding the investment and our ownership percentage we classify our investments as either available for sale trading equity method or cost method which are more fully described in note 8 we determine cost or amortized cost as appropriate on a specific identification basis  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value cost is generally computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis which approximates cost on a firstin firstout basis standard cost is based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed as incurred inventory held at consignment locations is included in our finished goods inventory consigned inventory was 275 million and 258 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively we review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence a statistical allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold the statistical allowance is based on an analysis of historical disposal activity historical customer shipments as well as estimated future sales a specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance we write off inventory in the period in which disposal occurs property plant and equipment acquisitionrelated intangibles and other capitalized costs property plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straightline method our cost basis includes certain assets acquired in business combinations that were initially recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition leasehold improvements are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements we amortize acquisitionrelated intangibles on a straightline basis over the estimated economic life of the assets capitalized software licenses generally are amortized on a straightline basis over the term of the license fully depreciated or amortized assets are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization impairments of longlived assets we regularly review whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of property plant and equipment or other longlived assets including intangible assets are impaired we assess the recoverability of assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respective carrying amounts any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets fair value is determined by available market valuations if applicable or by discounted cash flows goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 for our reporting units which compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated carrying value including goodwill see note 9 for additional information foreign currency the functional currency for our nonus subsidiaries is the us dollar accounts recorded in currencies other than the us dollar are remeasured into the functional currency current assets except inventories deferred income taxes other assets current liabilities and longterm liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period property plant and equipment with associated depreciation and inventories are valued at historical exchange rates revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are remeasured at the appropriate daily rate of exchange currency exchange gains and losses from remeasurement are credited or charged to oiampe see note 13 for additional information derivatives and hedging we use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk these instruments are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts which are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contracts are credited or charged to oiampe we do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instruments 35    in connection with the issuance of longterm debt we use financial derivatives such as treasury rate lock agreements that are recognized in aoci and amortized over the life of the related debt the results of these derivative transactions have not been material we do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes changes in accounting standards adopted standards for current period in april and august 2015 respectively the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201503 interest  imputation of interest subtopic 83530 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs and asu 201515 presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lineofcredit arrangements  amendments to sec paragraphs pursuant to staff announcement at june 18 2015 eitf meeting these standards require that costs associated with the issuance of debt except for costs associated with lineofcredit arrangements be reported as a direct reduction of the related debt balance previously such costs were recorded as deferred assets costs associated with lineofcredit arrangements may continue to be recorded as deferred assets we adopted these standards as of december 31 2015 and retrospectively applied the standards to prior periods presented herein the effect of the reclassification on our consolidated balance sheets is quantified in note 11 the reclassification we made to address these standards had no impact on our consolidated statements of income in november 2015 the fasb issued asu 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes this standard requires that companies classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities within a taxing jurisdiction as noncurrent on their consolidated balance sheets the effect of this new requirement is that deferred income taxes previously reported in either current assets or current liabilities shall be reclassified to noncurrent assets or liabilities this standard can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 early adoption is allowed we adopted this standard as of december 31 2015 and retrospectively applied it to prior periods presented herein the effect of the reclassifications on our consolidated balance sheets is quantified in note 6  standards not yet adopted in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 this standard provides a single set of guidelines for revenue recognition to be used across all industries and requires additional disclosures in july 2015 the fasb deferred the effective date by one year to december 15 2017 for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after that date this standard permits early adoption but not before the original effective date of december 15 2016 and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our financial position and results of operations as well as our selected transition method based on our preliminary assessment we believe the new standard will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations as we do not expect to change the manner or timing of recognizing revenue on a majority of our revenue transactions we recognize revenue on sales to customers including sales to distributors upon satisfaction of our performance obligations when the goods are shipped for consignment sales we recognize revenue when the goods are pulled from consignment inventory in february 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201502 consolidation topic 810  amendments to the consolidation analysis which changes the way reporting entities evaluate certain investment holdings for possible consolidation and also includes possible changes in disclosures resulting from that evaluation this standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning january 1 2016 and will have no material impact on our financial position and results of operations 36    in april 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201505 intangibles  goodwill and other  internaluse software subtopic 35040 customers accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement which provides guidance on whether a cloudcomputing arrangement contains a software license and whether that license should be accounted for separately as an asset or solely as a service contract this standard also aligns the accounting for licenses of internaluse software with the accounting for licenses of other acquired intangible assets this standard is effective beginning january 1 2016 and we will adopt it prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations     3 restructuring chargesother restructuring chargesother is comprised of the following components          for years ended december 31          2015        2014

stockbased compensation we have stock options outstanding to participants under longterm incentive plans we also have assumed stock options that were granted by companies that we later acquired unless the options are acquisitionrelated replacement options the option price per share may not be less than 100 percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant substantially all the options have a 10year term and vest ratably over four years our options generally continue to vest after the option recipient retires we also have rsus outstanding under longterm incentive plans each rsu represents the right to receive one share of ti common stock on the vesting date which is generally four years after the date of grant upon vesting the shares are issued without payment by the grantee beginning with 2013 grants rsus generally continue to vest after the recipient retires holders of most rsus receive an annual cash payment equivalent to the dividends paid on our common stock we have options and rsus outstanding to nonemployee directors under director compensation plans the plans generally provide for annual grants of stock options and rsus a onetime grant of rsus to each new nonemployee director and the issuance of ti common stock upon the distribution of stock units credited to deferred compensation accounts established for such directors we also have an employee stock purchase plan under which options are offered to all eligible employees in amounts based on a percentage of the employees compensation subject to a cap under the plan the option price per share is 85 percent of the fair market value on the exercise date and options have a threemonth term total stockbased compensation expense recognized was as follows           for years ended

compensation plans at fair value we estimate the fair values for nonqualified stock options using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model with the following weighted average assumptions

available implied volatility rates we believe that marketbased measures of implied volatility are currently the best available indicators of the expected volatility used in these estimates  we determine expected lives of options based on the historical option exercise experience of our optionees using a rolling 10year average we believe the historical experience method is the best estimate of future exercise patterns currently available riskfree interest rates are determined using the implied yield currently available for zerocoupon us government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options expected dividend yields are based on the annualized approved quarterly dividend rate and the current market price of our common stock at the time of grant no assumption for a future dividend rate change is included unless there is an approved plan to change the dividend in the near term the fair value per share of rsus is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant our employee stock purchase plan is a discountpurchase plan and consequently the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model is not used to determine the fair value per share of these awards the fair value per share under this plan equals the amount of the discount longterm incentive and director compensation plans stock option and rsu transactions under

minimum threshold of 10 percent operating margin before any profit sharing is paid at 10 percent operating margin profit sharing will be 2 percent of eligible payroll the maximum amount of profit sharing available under the plan is 20 percent of eligible payroll which is paid only if tis operating margin is at or above 35 percent for a full calendar year we recognized 309 million 269 million

     64      net deferred income tax asset       164             116        as a result of our early adoption of asu 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes we have adjusted the presentation of deferred taxes on the consolidated balance sheets we have retrospectively adjusted the 2014 consolidated balance sheets to conform to the 2015 presentation by reclassifying current deferred income tax assets and liabilities to noncurrent deferred income tax assets and liabilities the effect of applying the new standard as shown in the following table is the result of netting

relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets taxable income in prior carryback years and expectations for future taxable income changes in valuation allowance balances in the years 2015 2014 and 2013 of 9 million 24 million and 2 million respectively had no impact on net income  we have us and nonus tax loss carryforwards of approximately 35 million none of which will expire before the year 2025 a provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries to the extent that dividend payments from these subsidiaries are expected to result in additional tax liability the remaining undistributed earnings of approximately 835 billion at december 31 2015 have been indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states therefore no us tax provision has been made for taxes due upon remittance of these earnings the indefinitely reinvested earnings of our nonus subsidiaries are primarily invested in working capital and property plant and equipment determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability is not practical because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation  44    cash payments made for income taxes net of refunds were 1167 billion 1104 billion and 569 million for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively uncertain tax positions we operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any item on these tax returns because the matters challenged by authorities are typically complex their ultimate outcome is uncertain before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements we must determine that it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate tax authorities we recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions and penalties as components of oiampe the changes in the total amounts of uncertain tax positions are summarized as follows          2015        2014        2013       balance january 1       108             91

     9                          5       the liability for uncertain tax positions is a component of deferred credits and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets all of the 84 million liability for uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2015 is comprised of positions that if recognized would impact the tax rate if these tax liabilities are ultimately realized 12 million of existing deferred tax assets would also be realized related to refunds from counterparty jurisdictions resulting from procedures for relief from double taxation it is reasonably possible that the liability could increase in 2016 by up to 150 million for a tax depreciationrelated position the increase would offset the tax benefit realized with no net profit impact  all of the 108 million liability for uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2014 is comprised of positions that if recognized would impact the tax rate if these tax liabilities are ultimately realized 56 million of existing deferred tax assets would also be realized primarily related to refunds from counterparty jurisdictions resulting from procedures for relief from double taxation as of december 31 2015 the statute of limitations remains open for us federal tax returns for 2010 and following years audit activities related to our us federal tax returns through 2009 have been completed except for certain pending tax treaty procedures for relief from double taxation and the review of refunds claimed on amended returns for years prior to 2010 the procedures for relief from double taxation pertain to us federal tax returns for the years 2006 through 2009 in nonus jurisdictions the years open to audit represent the years still open under the statute of limitations with respect to major jurisdictions outside the united states our subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2007     7 financial instruments and risk concentration financial instruments we hold derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts the fair value of which was not material as of december 31 2015 our forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as

investments in cash equivalents shortterm investments and certain longterm investments as well as our postretirement plan assets and deferred compensation liabilities are carried at fair value the carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments the carrying value of our longterm debt approximates the fair value as measured using brokerdealer quotes which are level 2 inputs see note 8 for a description of fair value and the definition of level 2 inputs risk concentration we are subject to counterparty risks from financial institutions customers and issuers of debt securities financial instruments that could subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash deposits cash equivalents shortterm investments and accounts receivable to manage our credit risk exposure we place cash investments in investmentgrade debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer we also limit counterparties on cash deposits and financial derivative contracts to financial institutions with investmentgrade ratings  concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas we maintain allowances for expected returns disputes adjustments incentives and collectability these allowances are deducted from accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets  details of these accounts

availableforsale securities in oiampe in our consolidated statements of income  we classify certain mutual funds as trading securities these mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities we record changes in the fair value of these mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in sgampa  our other investments are not measured at fair value but are accounted for using either the equity method or cost method these investments consist of interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable equity securities gains and losses from equitymethod investments are reflected in oiampe based on our ownership share of the investees financial results gains and

at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date the threelevel hierarchy discussed below indicates the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fairvalue measurements          level 1  uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date          level 2  uses inputs other than level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models such as interest rates and volatility factors are corroborated by readily observable data we utilize a thirdparty data service to provide level 2 valuations we verify these valuations for reasonableness relative to unadjusted quotes obtained from brokers or dealers based on observable prices for similar assets in active markets 47             level 3  uses inputs that are unobservable supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment these values are generally determined using pricing models that utilize management estimates of market participant assumptions as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had no level 3 assets or liabilities other than certain assets held by our postretirement plans

defined benefit pension plans the defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997 and thencurrent participants were allowed to make a onetime election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan described below both defined contribution plans offer an employermatching savings option that allows employees to make pretax contributions to various investment choices including a ti common stock fund employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan where employermatching contributions are provided for up to 2 percent of the employees annual eligible earnings employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after november 1997 and through december 31 2003 may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan this plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2 percent of the employees annual eligible earnings plus an employermatching contribution of up to 4 percent of the employees annual eligible earnings employees hired after december 31 2003 do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2 percent of the employees annual eligible earnings  at december 31 2015 and 2014 as a

contribution toward the cost of those retiree medical benefits for certain retirees and their dependents the contribution rates are based upon various factors the most important of which are an employees date of hire date of retirement years of service and eligibility for medicare benefits the balance of the cost is borne by the plans participants employees hired after january 1 2001 are responsible for the full cost of their medical benefits during retirement nonus retirement plans we provide retirement coverage for nonus employees as required by local laws or to the extent we deem

consist of lowcost broadmarket index funds to mitigate risks of concentration within market sectors our investment policy is designed to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan assets and liabilities the appropriate mix of equity and bond investments is determined primarily through the use of detailed assetliability modeling studies that look to balance the impact of changes in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost most of our plans around the world have a greater proportion of fixed income securities with return characteristics that are more closely aligned with changes in the liabilities caused by discount rate volatility for the us plans we utilize an option collar strategy to reduce the volatility of returns on investments in us equity funds    the only level 3 asset in our worldwide benefit plans for the periods presented is a diversified property fund in a nonus pension plan we sold assets related to private equity limited partnerships in our us pension plan in 2014 these investments are valued using inputs from the fund managers and internal models    the following table summarizes the change in

to select an appropriate discount rate depending on the depth of the corporate bond market in the country in which the benefit plan operates in the united states we use a settlement approach whereby a portfolio of bonds is selected from the universe of actively traded highquality us corporate bonds the selected portfolio is designed to provide cash flows sufficient to pay the plans expected benefit payments when due the resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bonds for our nonus locations with a sufficient number of actively traded highquality bonds an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds available in each country in this manner a present value is developed the discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value for countries that lack a sufficient corporate bond market a government bond index adjusted for an appropriate risk premium is used to establish the discount rate  assumptions for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing we adjust the results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets we believe our assumptions are appropriate based on the investment mix and longterm nature of the plans investments assumptions used for the nonus defined benefit plans reflect the
