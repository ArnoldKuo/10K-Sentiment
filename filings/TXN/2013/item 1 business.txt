 company overviewat ti we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in more than 35 countries we have four segments analog embedded processing wireless and other we expect analog and embedded processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead and we therefore focus our resources on these segmentswe were the worlds fourth largest semiconductor company in 2012 as measured by revenue according to preliminary estimates from an external sourcefinancial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the united states is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned segment and geographic area data in tis 2012 annual report to stockholders it is incorporated herein by reference to such annual reportproduct informationsemiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors come in two basic forms individual transistors and integrated circuits generally known as chips that combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit our products more than 100000 orderable parts are integrated circuits that are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipmentwe sell catalog and to a lesser extent custom semiconductor products catalog products are designed for use by many customers andor many applications and are sold through both distribution and direct channels the majority of our catalog products are proprietary but some are commodity products the life cycles of catalog products generally span multiple years with some products continuing to sell for decades after their initial release custom products are designed for a specific customer for a specific application are sold only to that customer and are typically sold directly to the customer the life cycles of custom products are generally determined by endequipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels and how management allocates resources and measures results additional information regarding each segments products followsanalog analog semiconductors change realworld signals  such as sound temperature pressure or images  by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as digital signal processors dsps analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in every electronic device whether plugged into a wall or running off a battery we estimate that we sell our analog products to more than 100000 customers these sales generated about 55 percent of our revenue in 2012 according to external sources the worldwide market for analog semiconductors was about 39 billion in 2012 our analog segments revenue in 2012 was about 70 billion or about 18 percent of this fragmented market the leading position we believe that we are well positioned to increase our market share over timeour analog segment includes the following major product lines high volume analog amp logic hval power management power high performance analog hpa and silicon valley analog svahval products these include both highvolume analog and logic products highvolume analog includes integrated analog products for specific applications including custom products end markets for highvolume analog products include communications automotive computing and many consumer electronics products logic includes some commodity products marketed to many different customers for many different applicationspower products these include both catalog and applicationspecific products that help customers manage power in any type of electronic system we design and manufacture power management semiconductors for both portable devices 3batterypowered devices such as handheld consumer electronics laptop computers and cordless power tools and linepowered systems products that require an external electrical source such as computers digital tvs wireless basestations and highvoltage industrial equipmenthpa products these include catalog analog products such as amplifiers data converters and interface semiconductors that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets including the industrial communications computing and consumer electronics markets hpa products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years sva products these consist of products that we acquired through our purchase of national semiconductor corporation national in 2011 these include power management data converter interface and operational amplifier catalog analog products nearly all of which are complementary to our other analog products this portfolio of thousands of products is marketed to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets sva products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 yearsembedded processingour embedded processing products include our dsps and microcontrollers dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data microcontrollers are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment sales of embedded processing products generated about 15 percent of our revenue in 2012 according to external sources the worldwide market for embedded processors was about 17 billion in 2012 our embedded processing segments revenue in 2012 was about 20 billion this was the number two position and represented about 12 percent of this fragmented market we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over timean important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rampd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next we make and sell catalog embedded processing products used in many different applications and applicationspecific embedded processing products used in communications infrastructure equipment and automotive applications wirelessduring 2012 our wireless products consisted of omaptm applications processors connectivity products and baseband products we concentrated our wireless investments on omap applications processors and connectivity products for the smartphone and consumer tablet markets sales of wireless products generated about 14 billion or about 11 percent of our revenue for 2012 of which omap and connectivity products represented about 11 billion we had 03 billion in revenue from baseband products a product line that we have previously announced we are exiting in november 2012 we announced that we would restructure our wireless business to focus investments on embedded markets with greater potential for sustainable growth specifically we now focus our omap applications processors and connectivity products on embedded applications with long life cycles instead of on the smartphone and consumer tablet markets where large customers are increasingly developing their own custom chips these changes will result in lower resource and investment demands and as we have previously announced elimination of the wireless segment embedded omap applications processors which often use a standard operating system such as android linux qnx or windows are used in applications that are multifunction need a graphically intensive user interface and often are connected to the internet embedded connectivity products include lowpower wireless network standards like zigbee and other technologies such as bluetooth wifi gps and near field communications both of these product lines have many of the same characteristics as those in our embedded processing segment and will be reported in that segment beginning with our firstquarter 2013 financial report in 2012 sales of these products were about 150 million we expect our revenue from omap and connectivity products sold into smartphone and consumer tablet applications to decline rapidly in 2013 and to substantially cease by the end of the year we also expect baseband revenue to be essentially zero in 2013 beginning with our firstquarter 2013 financial report financial results for wireless products for the smartphone and consumer tablet markets will be included in other4otherother includes revenue from our smaller product lines such as dlp primarily used in projectors to create highdefinition images custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics and calculators it also includes royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies and revenue from transitional supply agreements related to acquisitions and divestitures other generated about 25 billion or about 19 percent of our revenue in 2012 we also include in other certain acquisitionrelated charges that are not used in evaluating results of and allocating resources to our analog embedded processing and wireless segments these charges include certain fairvalue adjustments restructuring charges transaction expenses acquisitionrelated retention bonuses and amortization of intangible assets other also includes certain corporatelevel items such as litigation and environmental costs

cyclethe global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature market cyclethe semiconductor cycle is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing 6capacity these are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle the semiconductor cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilitiesseasonalityour revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation our semiconductor sales generally are seasonally weaker in the first and fourth quarters and stronger in the second and third quarters as manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling seasons calculator revenue is tied to the us backtoschool season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarterscompetitive landscapein each segment we face significant global competition from numerous large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a companys product line the strength and depth of the sales network technological innovation technical support customer service quality reliability price and scale the primary competitive factors for our analog products include design proficiency a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance applications and sales support and manufacturing expertise and capacity our primary analog competitors include analog devices inc fairchild semiconductor corporation freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc nxp semiconductors nv qualcomm incorporated richtek technology corporation and stmicroelectronics nvthe primary competitive factors for our embedded processing products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets installed base of software software expertise applications and sales support and a products performance and power characteristics primary competitors of our embedded processing segment include atmel corporation freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag microchip technology inc nxp semiconductors nv renesas electronics corporation and stmicroelectronics nvthe primary competitive factors for our wireless products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets software expertise applications support and a products performance and power characteristics primary wireless competitors include broadcom corp csr plc intel corporation marvell technology group ltd nvidia corporation qualcomm incorporated and samsung lsi manufacturing semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is tested the wafer is cut into individual units and each unit is assembled into a package that then is usually retested the entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks with most products completing within 8 to 16 weeksthe cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by technology our analog products and most of our embedded processing products can be manufactured using mature and stable and therefore less expensive equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced cmos logic products such as our wireless productswe own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of capacity potentially hurting our profit margins conversely as product demand rises and factory utilization increases the fixed costs are spread over increased output potentially benefiting our profit margins we expect to maintain sufficient internal wafer fabrication capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs to supplement our internal wafer fabrication capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital our wafer manufacturing strategy utilizes the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries and subcontractors in 2012 we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers and about 75 percent of our advanced cmos logic needs from external foundries 7in 2011 we initiated closure of an older wafer fabrication facility in hiji japan and another in houston texas we expect to complete these plant closures in 2013inventoryour inventory practices differ by product but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand because of the longer product life cycles of catalog products and their inherently lower risk of obsolescence we generally carry more inventory of those products than custom products additionally we sometimes maintain catalogproduct inventory in unfinished wafer form as well as higher finishedgoods inventory of lowvolume products allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand we also have consignment inventory programs in place for our largest customers and some distributorsdesign centers our design centers provide design engineering and product application support as well as aftersales customer service the design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers customers our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems original design manufacturers odms contract manufacturers and distributors an oem designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures inhouse or has manufactured by others an odm designs and manufactures products for other companies which then sell those products under their own brand in 2012 no single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our revenue sales and distribution we market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force distributors and authorized thirdparty sales representatives we have sales or marketing offices in 34 countries worldwide and have expanded our sales networks in the emerging markets of china india and eastern europe over the last few years distributors located around the world account for about 50 percent of our revenue our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers they also sell products from our competitors our distribution network holds a mix of distributorowned and ticonsigned inventory over time we expect this mix will shift more toward consignment we sell our calculator products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers acquisitions divestitures and investments from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us in september 2011 we acquired national semiconductor corporationbacklog we define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be under certain circumstances subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations accordingly our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period our backlog of orders was 117 billion at december 31 2012 and 139 billion at december 31 2011raw materials we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 8intellectual property we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiationour semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are texas instruments and our corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include omaptm and dlp research and development our rampd expense was 188 billion in 2012 compared with 172 billion in 2011 and 157 billion in 2010 our primary areas of rampd investment were analog embedded processing and wireless products as announced in november 2012 we are discontinuing future investments in wireless omap processors and connectivity solutions for smartphones and consumer tabletswe conduct most of our rampd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties including software suppliers universities and select external industry consortia and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology from time to time we may terminate rampd projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product we do not expect that all of our rampd projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute significant revenue until at least a few years following completion executive officers of the registrantthe following is an alphabetical list of the names and ages of the
