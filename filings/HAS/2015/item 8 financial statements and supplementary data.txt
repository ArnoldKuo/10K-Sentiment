existing trademarks copyrights patents license agreements and other productrelated rights these rights were valued on their acquisition date based on the anticipated future cash flows from the underlying product line the company has certain intangible assets related to the tonka and milton bradley acquisitions that have an indefinite life  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units this quantitative twostep process begins with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists when performing the quantitative twostep impairment test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value also calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows    61    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data    the company may bypass the quantitative twostep impairment process and perform a qualitative assessment if it is not more likely than not that impairment exists performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill requires a high degree of judgment regarding assumptions underlying the valuation qualitative factors and their impact on critical inputs are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  during the fourth quarter of 2014 the company performed a qualitative assessment with respect to goodwill associated with all but one of its reporting units which determined that it was not necessary to perform a quantitative assessment the company also performed quantitative twostep annual impairment tests related to its intangible assets with indefinite lives as well as goodwill associated with backflip studios the companys majority owned mobile gaming reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2014 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were in excess of the carrying value of the related intangible assets or reporting units as applicable  the remaining intangibles having defined

proportion to actual and projected revenues  property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is computed using accelerated and straightline methods to depreciate the cost of property plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives the principal lives in years used in determining depreciation rates of various assets are land improvements 15 to 19 buildings and improvements 15 to 25 and machinery and equipment including computer hardware and software 3 to 12 depreciation expense is classified in the consolidated statements of operations based on the nature of the property and equipment being depreciated tools dies and molds are depreciated over a threeyear period or their useful lives whichever is less using an accelerated method the company generally owns all tools dies and molds related to its products  the company reviews property plant and equipment and other intangibles with defined lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values depending on the nature of the assets assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of the net book value or their estimated fair value less disposal costs  financial instruments  hasbros financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable shortterm borrowings accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities at december 28 2014 the carrying cost of these instruments approximated their fair value the companys financial instruments at december 28 2014 also

obtained under license the nonrecoverable portion of the guaranty is charged to expense at that time  advertising  production costs of commercials are expensed in the fiscal year during which the production is first aired the costs of other advertising and promotion programs are expensed in the fiscal year incurred  program production costs  the company incurs costs in connection with the production of television programming these costs are capitalized by the company as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of such period related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that impairment may exist the fair value is

of directors under this plan the company may grant stock options at or above the fair market value of the companys stock as well as restricted stock restricted stock units and contingent stock performance awards all awards are measured at fair value at the date of the grant and amortized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award for awards contingent upon company performance the measurement of the expense for these awards is based on the companys current estimate of its performance over the performance period for awards contingent upon the achievement of market conditions the probability of satisfying the market condition is considered in the estimation of the grant date fair value see note 13 for further discussion    64    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data    risk management contracts  hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and projected future foreign currency transactions these overthecounter contracts which hedge future purchases of inventory and other crossborder currency requirements not denominated in the functional currency of the business unit are primarily denominated in united states and hong kong dollars as well as euros further the company also used forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest payments related to the refinancing of the companys longterm debt which came due in 2014 all contracts are entered into with a number of counterparties all of which are major financial institutions the company believes that a default by a counterparty would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company hasbro does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes  at the inception of the contracts hasbro designates its derivatives as either cash flow or fair value hedges the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions all hedges designated as cash flow hedges are linked to forecasted transactions and the company assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis the effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction the ineffective portion of a hedging derivative if any is immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of operations  the company records all derivatives such as foreign currency exchange contracts and forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges and are effective are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss earnings aoce until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations the companys foreign currency and forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts hedging anticipated cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges when it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively any gain or loss deferred through that date remains in aoce until the forecasted transaction occurs at which time it is reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations to the extent the transaction is no longer deemed probable of occurring hedge accounting treatment is discontinued and amounts deferred would be reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations in the event hedge accounting requirements are not met gains and losses on such instruments are included currently in the consolidated statements of operations the company uses derivatives to economically hedge intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies the company does not use hedge accounting for these contracts as changes in the fair value of these contracts are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the intercompany loans  the company also used interest rate swap agreements to adjust the amount of longterm debt subject to fixed interest rates the interest rate swaps were matched with longterm debt due in 2014 and designated as fair value hedges of the change in fair value of the related debt obligations these agreements were recorded at their fair value as an asset or liability gains and losses on these contracts were included in the consolidated statements of operations and wholly offset by changes in the fair value of the related longterm debt in november 2012 these interest rate swap agreements were terminated the realized gain on the interest rate swaps was recorded as an adjustment to longterm debt and was amortized through the consolidated statements of operations over the term of the related longterm debt using a straightline method  net earnings per common share  basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year diluted net earnings per share is similar except that the weighted average number of shares outstanding is increased by dilutive securities and net earnings are adjusted if necessary for certain    65    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial
