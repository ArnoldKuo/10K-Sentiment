license agreements and other productrelated rights these rights were valued on their acquisition date based on the anticipated future cash flows from the underlying product line the company has certain intangible assets related to the tonka and milton bradley acquisitions that have an indefinite life  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a twostep process that begins with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value also calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows  the remaining intangibles having defined lives are being amortized over periods ranging from five to twenty years primarily using the straightline method at december 29 2013 approximately 12 of other intangibles net are being amortized in proportion to projected revenues  property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is computed using accelerated and straightline methods to depreciate the cost of property plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives the principal lives in years used in determining depreciation rates of various assets are land improvements 15 to 19 buildings and

property plant and equipment and other intangibles with defined lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values depending on the nature of the assets assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of the net book value or their estimated fair value less disposal costs  financial instruments  hasbros financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable shortterm borrowings accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities at december 29 2013 the carrying cost of these

approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes deferred taxes are measured using rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will be unrealized deferred income taxes have not been provided on the majority of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as the majority of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company  the company uses a two step process for the measurement of uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is a determination of whether the tax position should be recognized in the consolidated

value of the companys stock as well as restricted stock restricted stock units and contingent stock performance awards all awards are measured at fair value at the date of the grant and amortized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award for awards contingent upon company performance the measurement of the expense for these awards is based on the companys current estimate of its performance over the performance period for awards contingent upon the achievement of market conditions the probability of satisfying the market condition is considered in the estimation of the grant date fair value see note 13 for further discussion  risk management contracts  hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and projected future foreign currency transactions these overthecounter contracts which hedge future purchases of inventory and other crossborder currency requirements not denominated in the functional currency of the business unit are primarily denominated in united states and hong kong dollars as well as euros further the company also uses forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the anticipated future interest payments related to the expected refinancing of the companys longterm debt due in 2014 all contracts are entered into with a number of counterparties all of which are major financial institutions the company believes that a default by a counterparty would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company hasbro does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes  at the inception of the contracts hasbro designates its derivatives as either cash flow or fair value hedges the

statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data     risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions all hedges designated as cash flow hedges are linked to forecasted transactions and the company assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis the effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction the ineffective portion of a hedging derivative if any is immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of operations  the company records all derivatives such as foreign currency exchange contracts and forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges and are effective are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss earnings aoce until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations the companys foreign currency and forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts hedging anticipated cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges when it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively any gain or loss deferred through that date remains in aoce until the forecasted transaction occurs at which time it is reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations to the extent the transaction is no longer deemed probable of occurring hedge accounting treatment is discontinued and amounts deferred would be reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations in the event hedge accounting requirements are not met gains and losses on such instruments are included currently in the consolidated statements of operations the company uses derivatives to economically hedge intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies the company does not use hedge accounting for these contracts as changes in the fair value of these contracts are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the intercompany loans  the company also used interest rate swap agreements to adjust the amount of longterm debt subject to fixed interest rates the interest rate swaps were matched with longterm debt due in 2014 and designated as fair value hedges of the change in fair value of the related debt obligations these agreements were recorded at their fair value as an asset or liability gains and losses on these contracts were included in the consolidated statements of operations and wholly offset by changes in the fair value of the related longterm debt in november 2012 these interest rate swap agreements were terminated the realized gain on the interest rate swaps was recorded as an adjustment to longterm debt and is being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations over the term of the related longterm debt using a straightline method  net earnings per common share  basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year diluted net earnings per share is similar except that the weighted average number of shares outstanding is increased by dilutive securities and net earnings are adjusted if necessary for certain amounts related to dilutive securities dilutive securities include shares issuable upon exercise of stock options for which the market price exceeds the exercise price less shares which could have been purchased by the company with the related proceeds dilutive securities also include shares issuable under restricted stock unit award agreements options and restricted stock unit awards totaling 760 3409 and 1851 for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because to include them would have been antidilutive    61    table of contents

quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities and level 3 fair values are valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or
