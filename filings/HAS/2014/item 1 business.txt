our entertainment and licensing segment includes our lifestyle licensing digital gaming television and movie entertainment operations our lifestyle licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the out   4    table of contents  licensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings such as apparel publishing home goods and electronics or in certain situations to utilize them for toy products where we consider the outlicensing of brands to be more effective  our digital gaming business seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games for play on mobile devices personal computers and video game consoles based on those brands our agreement with electronic arts inc ea grants exclusive worldwide rights to create mobile games based on a number of our

70 majority stake in backflip a mobile game developer whose mobile gaming product offerings include dragonvale ninjump and paper toss in 2014 and beyond backflip intends to focus on its existing product lines and launching new games including those based on hasbro brands  to support our strategic objective of further developing our brands through television entertainment we operate a whollyowned television studio hasbro studios which produces television programming primarily based on our brands which is distributed on a global basis in addition hasbro studios has a coordinated development process which aligns with our 50 interest in a joint venture with discovery that operates hub network a cable television network in the united states hub network is dedicated to providing highquality childrens and family entertainment  in addition to the above we also seek to promote and leverage our brands through major motion pictures in june 2014 transformers age of extinction the fourth major motion picture based on the transformers brand is scheduled to be released by paramount pictures in 2013 gi joe retaliation the second major motion picture based on the gi joe brand was released in may 2012 battleship was released by universal pictures  major motion pictures and television programming based on our owned and controlled brands provide our consumers with the ability to experience these properties in a different format which we believe can result in increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related dvd releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from toy and game product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment and licensing segment  global operations  in our global operations segment we manufacture and source production of substantially all of our toy and game products the company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland which predominantly produce game products sourcing of our other production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see manufacturing and importing below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing  other information  to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer is located    5    table of contents certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence  each of our four product categories namely boys games girls and preschool generate greater than 10 of our net revenues for more information including the amount of net revenues attributable to each of our four product categories see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k  working capital requirements  our working capital needs are financed primarily through cash generated from operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings our borrowings generally reach peak levels during the third or fourth quarter of each year this corresponds to the time of year when our receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of the production and shipment of product in preparation for the holiday season the strategy of retailers has generally been to make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy our historical revenue pattern is one in which the second half of the year is more significant to our overall business than the first half in 2013 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 65 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for 34 and 31 of full year net revenues respectively  the toy and game business is also characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions as a result comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response inventory management practices result in fewer orders being placed significantly in advance of shipment and more orders being placed for immediate delivery retailers generally time their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is a general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are indicative of future sales the types of programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2014 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2013 and in prior years  historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2013 we utilized cash from our operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements  royalties and product development  our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our entertainment offerings including both the continuing development of new brands and products and the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy and game products are developed by a global development group and the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in 2013 2012 and 2011 we incurred expenses of 207591 201197 and 197638 respectively on activities relating to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers    6    table of contents in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees  we also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements  in 2013 2012 and 2011 we incurred 338919 302066 and 339217 respectively of royalty expense in 2013 royalty expense included 63801 related to the settlement of an arbitration award for a dispute between the company and an inventor as well as the amendment of its license agreement with zynga our royalty expense in any given year may also vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media  marketing and sales  as we are focused on reimagining reinventing and reigniting our many brands and imagining inventing and igniting new brands we have a global marketing function which establishes brand direction and messaging as well as assists the selling entities in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments we also maintain sales and marketing functions in our selling entities which are responsible for local market activities and execution our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased etailers our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products remaining sales are generated by independent distributors who sell our products for the most part in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence while we have thousands of customers the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers while this concentration of customers provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this also creates additional risks to our business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with us in addition customer concentration may decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2013 net revenues from our three largest customers walmart stores inc toys r us inc and target corporation represented 16 10 and 9 respectively of consolidated net revenues and sales to our top five customers including walmart toys r us inc and target accounted for approximately 39 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 61 of our net revenues were derived from these top three customers  we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television in addition we engage in digital marketing and advertising for our brands generally our advertising highlights selected items in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote the sale of not only the selected item but also other items we offer in those product groups as well hasbro studios produces television entertainment based primarily on our brands which appears on hub network in the us other major networks internationally and on various other digital platforms such as netflix and itunes we introduce many of our new products to major customers during the year prior to the year of introduction of such products for retail sale in addition we showcase certain of our new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows in 2013 2012 and 2011 we incurred 398098 422239 and 413951 respectively in expense related to advertising and promotion programs certain entertainmentbased products such as products based on major motion pictures generally do not require the same level of advertising that we spend on other nonentertainment based products    7    table of contents manufacturing and importing  during 2013 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in our two owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland  most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year our manufacturing processes and those of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly the countries of the far east and particularly china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us we purchase most of our raw materials and component parts used in our owned manufacturing facilities from suppliers in the united states and certain other countries  we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers together with our own facilities as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2014 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured and production shifted to those new sources the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of normal trade relations status with china or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china such as higher chinese labor costs or an appreciation in the chinese yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured in china and imported into other markets  competition  we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of toys and games and other entertainment offerings but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with companies that offer branded entertainment focused on children and their families competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing in entertainment hasbro studios and hub network compete with other childrens television networks and entertainment producers such as nickelodeon cartoon network and disney channel for viewers advertising revenue and distribution  in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and brandedplay entertainment companies we contend with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age thereby the variety of product and entertainment offerings available for children has expanded and product lifecycles have shrunk as children move on to more sophisticated offerings at younger ages we refer to this as children getting older younger as a result our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers we also compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with entertainment offerings of many technology companies such as makers of tablets mobile devices video games and other consumer electronic products    8    table of contents the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings  employees  at december 29 2013 we employed approximately 5000 persons worldwide approximately 2500 of whom were located in the united states  trademarks copyrights and patents  we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect  government regulation  our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the cpsa the federal hazardous substances act the fhsa the flammable fabrics act the ffa and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition a few of our products such as the food mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration  the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the cpsc to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product a banned hazardous substance under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an imminently hazardous consumer product under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned  consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many international markets including canada australia and europe we utilize independent third party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our product could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well  the childrens television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission as well as the laws of certain other countries also place limitations on television commercials during childrens programming and on advertising in other forms to children and on the collection of information from children under the age
