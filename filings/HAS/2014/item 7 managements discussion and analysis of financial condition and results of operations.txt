interest rate on applicable us treasury bills at the time of repurchase  including the notes described above the company has remaining principal amounts of longterm debt at december 29 2013 of approximately 1384895 due at varying times from 2014 through 2040 425000 of this longterm debt is due may 2014 however the company currently expects to issue longterm notes in order to finance most if not all of the repayment of this debt the company also had letters of credit and other similar instruments of 209398 and purchase commitments of 297817 outstanding at december 29 2013 letters of

successful in sustaining its position in addition the company is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments of approximately 17560 in 2014  critical accounting policies and significant estimates  the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the companys reported financial results include sales allowances program production costs recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments pension costs and obligations and income taxes  sales allowances  sales allowances for customer promotions discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment revenue from product sales less related sales allowances along with license fees and royalty revenue comprise net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts certain of the allowances such as the returns allowance are based on market data historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation  for its allowance programs that are not fixed such as returns the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions these estimates are reviewed periodically    43    table of contents  against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues during 2013 there have been no material adjustments to the companys estimates made in prior years  program production costs  the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs based primarily on the companys toy and game brands including animated and liveaction programs and game shows these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on managements future revenue and cost estimates  the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individualfilmforecast method ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the television program and include toy game and other merchandise licensing fees first run program distribution fees and other revenue sources such as dvd and digital distribution our ultimate revenue estimates for each television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information when estimates for a television program are revised the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our television programs in the us which are distributed on hub network and available on netflix and itunes our ability to achieve broad distribution and viewer acceptance in international markets and success of our programrelated toy game and other merchandise  for the year ended december 29 2013 we have 79965 of program production costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets we currently expect that approximately 93 of capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3year period 2014 through 2016 future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and managements then current estimates of ultimate revenues during 2013 the company did not incur any significant impairment charges related to its program production costs  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows  the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach the companys annual goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the estimated fair value of the companys reporting units with allocated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying value no reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing the first step of the impairment test accordingly no impairment was indicated the companys annual impairment tests related to    44    table of contents  intangible assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth quarter of 2013 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying value of the related assets the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge at december 29 2013 the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of 670059 recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 300261 at december 29 2013 during 2013 the company incurred 19736 in impairment charges relating to reduced expectations for certain products as well as the decision to exit certain other product lines  recoverability of royalty advances and commitments  the companys ability to earnout royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the nonrecoverable minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 29 2013 the company had 294991 of prepaid royalties 152459 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 142532 of which are included in other assets during 2013 the company incurred 20851 related to the amendment of its license agreement with zynga as a result of this settlement the company agreed to pay zynga 12500 in satisfaction of all future required royalty advances with the remainder of the charge comprised of a writedown of prepaid royalties  pension costs and obligations  pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the us with no future benefits accruing to employees the company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze the company uses its fiscal yearend date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year during 2013 the company recognized pension curtailment and settlement charges of 6993 related to its us pension plans as a result of headcount reductions due to restructuring activities  the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment    45    table of contents  classes and the current economic environment based on this information the companys estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2013 pension expense for the us plans was 700 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2013 pension expense for us plans by approximately 630  discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the companys weighted average discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2013 pension expense was 449 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the companys discount rate would have increased 2013 pension expense by approximately 459  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods at december 29 2013 the companys us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of 69716 included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to 138946 at december 30 2012 the decrease primarily reflects unrecognized actuarial gains in 2013 compared to losses in 2012 primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used to measure plan obligations at december 29 2013 as well as benefits paid in 2013 related to workforce reductions the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december 29 2013 increased to 502 at december 29 2013 from 409 used at december 30 2012 a decrease of 025 in the companys discount rate would have increased the 2013 projected benefit obligation by approximately 9722 pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains  income taxes  the companys annual income tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the companys annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions despite the companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges these estimated liabilities are adjusted as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit  an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the companys interim results in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the companys interim results the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time changes in the companys estimated effective income tax rate during 2013 were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction in addition changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs during 2013 the company recorded a total benefit of approximately 30000 associated with discrete tax events primarily related to the completion of us tax examinations as well as certain other us and foreign prior period tax adjustments  in certain cases tax law requires items to be included in the companys income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the consolidated financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the consolidated financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on the companys tax returns while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time such as depreciation expense these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the companys income tax returns valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income including capital gains to fully realize    46    table of contents  the future deductions or capital losses deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the companys income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the companys consolidated financial statements or income recognized in the consolidated financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the companys income tax return deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as most of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company in the event the company determines that such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries at december 29 2013 the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries on cumulative undistributed earnings was approximately 492000  contractual obligations and commercial commitments  in the normal course of its business the company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license which may require the payment of minimum guarantees as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment in addition the company has 1384895 in principal amount of longterm debt outstanding at december 29 2013 future payments required under these and other obligations as of december 29 2013 are as

including potential interest and penalties of 80006 for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns the company does not know the ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability accordingly these amounts are not included in the table above  in connection with the companys agreement to form a joint venture with discovery the company is obligated to make future payments to discovery under a tax sharing agreement these payments are contingent upon the company having sufficient taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related to the joint venture accordingly estimates of these amounts are included in the table above  in july 2013 the company acquired a 70 stake in backflip and will be required to purchase the remaining 30 in the future contingent on the achievement by backflip of certain predetermined financial performance metrics the company does not know the ultimate timing that these predetermined financial performance metrics may be met and thereby cannot currently estimate the purchase price of the remaining 30  in july 2013 the company amended agreements with disney related to its marvel and star wars licenses which provide for minimum guaranteed royalty payments and requires the company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities in connection with the marvel amendment the marvel license has been extended through 2020 and may require up to 170000 in guaranteed royalties that are not included in the table above are contingent on the quantity and type of theatrical movie releases and may be    47    table of contents  payable during the next six years approximately 50000 of these additional royalties are expected to be paid in 2014 based on expected qualifying theatrical releases additional guaranteed royalties related to the amendment of the star wars license agreement are included in the table above  purchase commitments represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase inventory and tooling in the ordinary course of business the reported amounts exclude inventory and tooling purchase liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 29 2013  in addition to the amounts included in the table above the company expects to make contributions totaling approximately 6400 related to its unfunded us and other international pension plans in 2014 the company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately 209398 at december 29 2013  the company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above  financial risk management  the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real russian ruble and mexican peso and to a lesser extent currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries  to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate 48144 decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions  the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the companys revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts  the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 29 2013 these contracts had net unrealized losses of 10875 of which 386 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets 1069 are recorded in other assets 10260 are recorded in accrued liabilities and 2070 are recorded in other liabilities included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 29 2013 are deferred losses of 9337 net of tax related to these derivatives  at december 29 2013 the company had fixed rate longterm debt excluding adjustments of 1384895 the company was party to several interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 400000 to adjust the amount of longterm debt subject to fixed interest rates the interest rate swaps were matched with specific longterm debt issues and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt changes in fair value of these contracts were wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related longterm debt in november 2012 these interest rate swap agreements were terminated the fair value was recorded as an adjustment to longterm debt and is now being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations over the life of the remaining longterm debt using a straightline method at december 29 2013 this adjustment to longterm debt was 3390 as a result of this termination longterm debt    48    table of contents  is no longer affected by variable interest rates and thereby earnings and cash flows are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates the company estimates that a hypothetical quarter percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this longterm debt excluding the current portion by approximately 23000  of the 1384895 in fixed rate longterm debt at december 29 2013 425000 matures in may 2014 the company currently expects to issue longterm notes in 2014 to finance the repayment of most if not all of this debt as such during the fourth quarter of 2013 the company entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with total notional value of 300000 to hedge the anticipated underlying us treasury interest rate associated with the expected issuance of longterm debt to refinance most if not all of the aforementioned current portion of longterm debt these interest rate swaps were matched with the expected longterm debt issuance and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in future interest payments the fair value of these instruments is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive earnings and will be amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method once the expected debt issuance occurs at december 29 2013 the fair value of these instruments is 3172 and is recorded to prepaid expenses and other current assets  the economy and inflation  the principal market for the companys products is the retail sector revenues from the companys top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 39 of its consolidated net revenues in 2013 and 42 and 45 of its consolidated net revenues in 2012 and 2011 respectively the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate  the companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2013 approximately 65 of the companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas  quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the companys future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the companys significant retailers could negatively impact the companys future revenues  the effect of inflation on the companys operations during 2013 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly  other information  the company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position
