segments engage in the marketing and selling of various toy and game products described above our toy and game products are primarily developed by crossfunctional teams including members of our global development and marketing groups to establish a cohesive brand direction and assist the segments in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of these groups are allocated to the principal segments our us and canada segment covers the united states and canada while the international segment primarily includes europe the asia pacific region and latin and south america the entertainment and licensing segment conducts our movie television and digital gaming entertainment operations including the operations of hasbro studios and backflip as well as engages in the outlicensing of our trademarks characters and other brand and intellectual property rights to third parties for noncompeting products our global operations segment is responsible for arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the us and canada and international segments financial information with respect to our segments and geographic areas is included in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k the following is a discussion of each segment  us and canada this segment engages in the marketing and sale of our products in the united states and canada the us and canada segment promotes our brands through innovation and reinvention of toys and games this is accomplished through introducing new products and initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and licenses this strategy leverages efforts to increase consumer awareness of the companys brands through entertainment experiences including motion pictures and television programming  international the international segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most countries in europe latin and south america and the asia pacific region and through distributors in those countries where we have no direct presence we have offices in more than 35 countries contributing to sales in more than 120 countries  in addition to growing brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses we seek to grow our international business by continuing to opportunistically expand into emerging markets in eastern europe asia and latin and south america emerging markets are an area of high priority for us as we believe they offer greater opportunities for revenue growth than developed markets key emerging markets include russia brazil and the peoples republic of china china and during 2015 we opened offices in south africa and thailand net revenues from emerging markets represented 14 of our total consolidated net revenues in 2015 in 2015 net revenues from emerging markets decreased 9 primarily due to a challenging foreign currency environment whereas 2014 and 2013 net revenues in emerging markets grew 20 and 25 respectively the strengthening of    4    table of contents  the us dollar had a significant impact on the international segment during 2015 the us dollar strengthened against nearly all of our major selling currencies including the brazilian real euro mexican peso and russian ruble the negative impact from foreign currency translation on international segment net revenues for 2015 and 2014 was 3794 million and 877 million respectively furthermore absent the negative impact of foreign currency net revenues from emerging markets grew approximately 15 financial information with respect to foreign currency risk management is included in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k  entertainment and licensing our entertainment and licensing segment includes our consumer products licensing digital gaming television and movie entertainment operations  our consumer products licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings such as apparel publishing home goods and electronics or in certain situations to utilize them for toy products where we consider the outlicensing of brands to be more effective  our digital gaming business seeks to promote our brands largely through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games for play on mobile devices personal computers and video game consoles based on those brands we have a 70 majority ownership in backflip a mobile game developer as we seek to complement the aforementioned outlicensing with the development of internal digital gaming resources backflips product offerings include games for tablets and mobile devices including the dragonvale game backflip intends to continue focusing on its existing game titles particularly dragonvale and to launch new games including game offerings based on hasbro brands to further extend its brands into digital media and gaming the company also outlicenses its properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games and other gaming experiences based on those brands the company has digital gaming relationships with electronic arts inc activision ubisoft and others lastly we also license our brands to third parties engaged in other forms of gaming including scientific games corporation  major motion pictures and television programming based on our owned and controlled brands provide both immersive storytelling and the ability for our consumers to experience these properties in a different format which we believe can result in increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related home entertainment releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from toy and game product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment and licensing segment  global operations our global operations segment sources production of our toy and game products through august 2015 the company owned and operated manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland which predominantly produced game products these facilities were sold to cartamundi nv cartamundi on august 31 2015 cartamundi will continue to manufacture game products for us under a manufacturing agreement sourcing for our other production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see manufacturing and importing below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing  other information to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer is geographically located  certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence    5    table of contents each of our four product categories namely boys games girls and preschool generate greater than 10 of our net revenues for more information including the amount of net revenues attributable to each of our four product categories see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k  working capital requirements  our working capital needs are financed through cash generated from operations primarily through the sale of toys and games and secondarily through our consumer products licensing operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings  our customer order patterns may vary from year to year largely due to fluctuations in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions as such a disproportionate volume of our net revenues are earned during the third and fourth quarters leading up to the retail industrys holiday selling season including christmas as a result comparisons of unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in the prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response or justintime inventory management practices result in a significant proportion of orders being placed for immediate delivery although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are indicative of future sales we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy as such our business generally earns more revenue in the second half of the year compared to the first half in 2015 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 66 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters each accounting for 33 of full year net revenues the types of programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2016 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2015 and in prior years  historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2015 we utilized cash from our operations borrowings under our commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements  product development and royalties  our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our brandedplay and entertainment offerings and requires continued development of new brands and products alongside the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy and game products are developed by a global development function the costs of which are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in 2015 2014 and 2013 we incurred expenses of 2429 million 2226 million and 2076 million respectively on activities related to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers  in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees    6    table of contents we also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements  in 2015 2014 and 2013 we incurred 3792 million 3053 million and 3389 million respectively of royalty expense in 2013 royalty expense included 638 million related to the settlement of an arbitration award for a dispute between the company and an inventor as well as costs related to the amendment of the companys license agreement with zynga our royalty expense in any given year may also vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media  marketing and sales  while our global development function focuses on brand and product innovation and reinvention our global marketing function establishes brand direction and messaging and assists the selling entities in establishing local marketing programs the global marketing group works crossfunctionally with the global development function to deliver unified brandspecific points of view the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in addition to the global marketing function our local selling entities employ sales and marketing functions responsible for local market activities and execution  our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores drug stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased etailers our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products with remaining sales generated by independent distributors who for the most part sell our products in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence notwithstanding our thousands of customers the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers customer concentration provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution practices and other reductions in costs of sales and distribution however customer concentration can also create additional risks for our business these risks can create potential detriments to our business resulting from the financial difficulties of our major customers which could lead to reductions in sales or unfavorable changes in our business relationships with one or more of our major customers customer concentration may also decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2015 net revenues from our top five customers accounted for approximately 39 of our consolidated global net revenues including our three largest customers walmart stores inc toys r us inc and target corporation who represented 16 9 and 9 respectively of consolidated global net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 59 of our net revenues were derived from these top three customers  we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television and through digital marketing and advertising of our brands products are strategically crosspromoted by spotlighting specific products alongside related offerings in a manner that promotes the sale of not only the selected item but also those complementary products in addition to those advertising initiatives hasbro studios produces entertainment based primarily on our brands which appears on discovery family channel and other major networks globally as well as on various other digital platforms such as netflix and itunes we also introduce many of our new products to major customers within one to two years leading up to their year of retail introduction we generally showcase certain new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows including in hong kong and nuremburg germany in 2015 2014 and 2013 we incurred 4094 million 4203 million and 3981 million respectively in expense related to advertising and promotional programs  manufacturing and importing  during 2015 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in two previously owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and    7    table of contents  waterford ireland these facilities were owned by the company through august 2015 at which point they were sold to cartamundi who will continue to manufacture game products for us under a manufacturing agreement  we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2016 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured and production shifted to those new sources the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of normal trade relations status with china or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china such as higher chinese labor costs or an appreciation in the chinese yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured in china and imported into other markets  most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year  the manufacturing processes of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly the countries of the far east particularly china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us  competition  we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of toys and games and other family entertainment offerings but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with other companies that offer branded entertainment specific to children and their families competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing in entertainment hasbro studios and discovery family channel compete with other childrens and family television networks and entertainment producers such as nickelodeon cartoon network and disney channel for viewers advertising revenue and distribution  in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and brandedplay entertainment companies we contend with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age thereby the variety of product and entertainment offerings available for children has expanded and product life cycles have shortened as children move on to more sophisticated offerings at younger ages this has been referred to as children getting older younger but may also be referred to as developmental compression as a result our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers and companies offering branded family entertainment we also compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with entertainment offerings of many technology companies such as makers of tablets mobile devices video games and other consumer electronic products  the volatility in

specifically indicated all dollar or share amounts herein are expressed in millions of dollars or shares except for per share amounts  we are focusing our global efforts around our brand architecture which includes a heightened emphasis and reliance on our franchise and key partner brands and development of those brands across the brand blueprint  we have made a strategic decision to focus on fewer larger global brands as we build our business we are moving away from sku making behaviors which involve building a large number of products across many brands towards global brand building with an emphasis on developing our franchise and key partner brands which we view as having the largest global potential as we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands our future success depends to a greater extent on our ability to successfully develop those brands across our brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of those brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets this strategy has required us to build and develop competencies in new areas including storytelling digital content and consumer products developing and growing these competencies has required significant effort time and money our future success is dependent on our ability to continue building our brands across the blueprint  in 2015 revenues from our seven franchise brands littlest pet shop magic the gathering monopoly nerf my little pony playdoh and transformers totaled 52 of our aggregate net revenues our key partner brands including disney marvel and lucasfilm also constitute a significant portion of our overall business in 2015 net revenues from our partner brands constituted 28 of our aggregate net revenues together our franchise and partner brands are critical to our business if we are unable to successfully execute this strategy and to maintain and develop our franchise and key partner brands in the future such that our product offerings based on these brands are not sought after by consumers to the extent required to maintain and grow those brands our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will be harmed in addition to continuing to grow and develop our existing franchise brands successfully executing our brand strategy may also require us to be able to successfully develop other brands such as current challenger brands to franchise brand status there is no guarantee that we will be able to do this  consumer interests change rapidly making it difficult to design and develop products which will be popular with children and families  the interests of children and families evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year to be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content products and play patterns which will capture childrens and families interests and imagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative products which can compete successfully for consumers limited time attention and spending this challenge is more difficult with the ever increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests coupled with an ever changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for childrens and families interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products can be popular    11    table of contents  during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced as a result individual childrens and family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles if we devote time and resources to developing entertainment and products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in significant quantities to be profitable to us our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be damaged similarly if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests our revenues and earnings will be reduced  additionally our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our childrens and family entertainment products and properties by consumers in diverse markets around the world with different tastes and preferences as such our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product and entertainment offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience  the challenge of continuously developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of todays children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them  children are increasingly utilizing electronic offerings such as tablet devices and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative technologydriven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies digital media and social media companies to meet this challenge we and our competitors are designing and marketing products which incorporate increasing technology seek to integrate digital and analog play and aim to capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media  with the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings there is no guarantee that            any of our brands products or product lines will achieve popularity or continue to be popular            any property for which we have a significant license will achieve or sustain popularity            any new products or product lines we introduce will be considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate market acceptance or            any products life cycle or sales quantities will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover our development manufacturing marketing royalties including royalty advances and guarantees and other costs of producing marketing and selling the product  entertainment is an increasingly important success factor for our brand awareness storytelling and brand building  entertainment media in forms such as television motion pictures digital products digital shorts dvd releases and other media have become increasingly important platforms for consumers to experience our brands and our partners brands and the success or lack of success of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial success we spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases both by our partners and our own media releases not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties heavily impact the timing of media development release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts  for 2016 we are developing and marketing significant product lines tied to the scheduled motion picture releases by key partners of captain america civil war moana rogue one a star wars story and trolls those motion pictures are all being developed and released by our partners and our partners control the content and schedule for such motion pictures other key partner product lines we are offering such as yokaiwatch depend on television support by our partners for their successes similarly we are developing and marketing products for entertainment we play a more active role in developing or develop ourselves if those motion pictures television shows or any other key entertainment content for which we develop and market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate our revenues and earnings will be reduced    12    table of contents the ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors and studio and media partners we do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit developed or released and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates or cancel development all together this can make it difficult for us to get feature films developed plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture and other media releases given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts  when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business  lack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainment media for which we offer products can harm our business  motion pictures television digital products or other media for which we develop products may not be as popular with consumers as we anticipated while it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of media efforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings if our and our partners media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed  discovery family channel our cable television joint venture with discovery communications inc in the united states competes with a number of other childrens television networks for viewers advertising revenue and distribution fees there is no guarantee that discovery family channel will be successful similarly hasbro studios programming distributed internationally and backflip studios digital products compete with content from many other parties lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of content developed by hasbro studios and backflip studios or other content appearing on discovery family channel and products related to that content could significantly harm our business similarly our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with our investment in discovery family channel such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for discovery family channel during 2015 we spent 425 million for television programming and film projects being developed by hasbro studios and we anticipate that we will continue spending at comparable levels in 2016 and future years  at december 27 2015 2429 million or 51 of our total assets represented our investment in discovery family channel if discovery family channel does not achieve success or if there are subsequent declines in the success or profitability of the channel then our investment may become impaired which could result in a writedown through net earnings  the childrens and family entertainment industry and consumer products industry are highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors or with our retailers private label toy products our revenues market share and profitability could decline  the childrens and family entertainment industry and the consumer products industry are and will continue to be highly competitive we compete in the united states and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers marketers and sellers of analog toys and games digital gaming products digital media products which combine analog and digital play and other entertainment and consumer products as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels in addition we compete with other companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories across our business we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase  in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the childrens and family entertainment industry and in the consumer products industry are low and the increasing importance of digital    13    table of contents  media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets and has broadened the array of companies we compete with new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time these existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences our competitors products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products lower our revenues and lower our profitability  in recent years retailers have also developed their own privatelabel products that directly compete with the products of traditional manufacturers and brand owners some retail chains that are our customers sell privatelabel childrens and family entertainment products designed manufactured and branded by the retailers themselves these products may be sold at prices lower than our prices for comparable products which may result in lower purchases of our products by these retailers and may reduce our market share  an inability to develop and introduce planned products product lines and new brands in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business  in developing products product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development implementation and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule there is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a costeffective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands this risk is heightened by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business the risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies utilizing digital media to a greater degree and providing greater innovation and product differentiation unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process significant increases in the planned cost of development or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or in some situations may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued  changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance  our global operations mean we produce and buy products and sell products in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies as a result if the exchange rate between the united states dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results as reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected as an example if the dollar appreciates 10 relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had 200 million of net revenues the dollar value of those sales as they are translated into us dollars would decrease by 20 million in our consolidated financial results as such we would recognize a 20 million decrease in our net revenues even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed similarly our expenses can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control late in 2014 and throughout 2015 certain key currencies such as the euro russian ruble and brazilian real depreciated significantly compared to the us dollar this depreciation had a significant negative impact on our 2014 and 2015 revenues and earnings similar depreciation in key currencies during 2016 may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in us dollars  global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers can harm our business and financial performance  we design manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers our financial performance is impacted by the    14    table of contents  level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate recessions credit crises and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the united states and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence similarly reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers such as their homes or stock market investments can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability  in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending andor sales allowances or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability  challenging market conditions in certain developed economies such as in australia and certain western european countries make it more difficult for us to succeed  our future success in developed economies is impacted by market conditions for example a european sovereign debt crisis or other significant negative shock to european markets could lead to a recession in europe which may negatively impact consumers and in turn sales of our products in the european markets similar negative events impacting the market in the united states and other developed economies may harm our business  many categories within the toy game and family entertainment industries in certain developed economies such as australia and certain western european countries have not grown or in some cases have even declined in certain recent years in addition many current economic predictions suggest developed economies may grow only modestly if at all in the next several years we have substantial business in developed economies and these markets represent a majority of our current product sales it is more difficult for us to grow or even maintain our business when the overall market in certain of the major countries we serve is not growing or is declining to succeed in a market that is stable or declining we must maintain or gain market share from our competitors which is more difficult than growing in an expanding market as long as economic conditions in the developed economies remain difficult this will be an additional challenge for the company  an increasing portion of our business is expected to come from emerging markets and growing business in emerging markets presents additional challenges  we expect an increasing portion of our net revenues to come from emerging markets in the future including eastern europe latin america and asia in 2015 revenues in emerging markets constituted approximately 14 of our net revenues up from only 6 of our net revenues in 2010 over time we expect our emerging market net revenues to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets operating in an increasing number of markets each with its own unique consumer preferences and business climates presents additional challenges that we must meet in addition to the need to successfully anticipate and serve different global consumer preferences and interests sales and operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to other risks associated with international operations including            complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of laws and regulations that impact our product offerings and related enforcement            potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions            difficulties understanding the retail climate consumer trends local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from the united states    15    table of contents         difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another including port congestion strikes and other transportation delays and interruptions and            the imposition of tariffs quotas or other protectionist measures  because of the importance of our emerging market net revenues our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our emerging market business  our business depends in large part on the success of our key partner brands and on our ability to maintain and extend solid relationships with our key partners  as part of our strategy in addition to developing and marketing products based on properties we own or control we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties  we currently have inlicenses to several successful entertainment properties including marvel and star wars each owned by disney these licenses typically have multiyear terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products in recent years our sales of products under the marvel and star wars licenses have been highly significant to our business if we fail to meet our contractual commitments andor any of these licenses were to terminate and not be renewed or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license beginning in 2016 our product offerings under licenses with disney will expand to include product offerings based on the disney princess and frozen brands  our license to the marvel property is granted from marvel entertainment llc and marvel characters bv together marvel our license to the star wars property is granted by lucas licensing ltd and lucasfilm ltd together lucas both marvel and lucas are owned by the walt disney company  our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season this seasonality is exacerbated by retailers quick response inventory management techniques  sales of our toys games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailers investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier  the level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our    16    table of contents  failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in our under producing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season  the concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us  we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 27 2015 walmart stores inc toys r us inc and target corporation accounted for approximately 16 9 and 9 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart toys r us and target in the aggregate accounted for approximately 39 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 59 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us favor competitors or new entrants increase their direct competition with us by expanding their privatelabel business change their purchasing patterns alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products or return substantial amounts of our products it could significantly harm our sales profitability and financial condition customers make no binding longterm commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products in addition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers furthermore the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability  part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporating progressive technology integrating digital and analog play these products can be more difficult and expensive to design and manufacture which may reduce margins on some or a portion of these products compared to more traditional toys and games and such products may have short life spans  as childhood evolves and children become more interested in sophisticated product offerings such as video games consumer electronics and social and digital media at younger and younger ages we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers to continue capturing the interest of sophisticated youth we must offer innovative childrens electronic toy and game products this is another key to our strategy complementing analog play with digital integration and investing in technology development these electronic and digital products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales however childrens electronic and digital products in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks  costs associated with designing developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures in order to recoup these higher costs sufficient sales quantities at sufficient prices which reflect those higher costs are necessary but may be constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions meaning we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs additionally designing developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products requires different competencies and follows    17    table of contents  different timelines than traditional toys and games delays in the design development or production of these products incorporated into or associated with traditional toys and games could have a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such products in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games  our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations  we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 27 2015 our net revenues from the international segment comprised approximately 44 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect net revenues from our international segment to continue accounting for a significant portion of our revenues in fact over time we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of our overall business as a result of a key business strategy to expand our presence in emerging and underserved international markets additionally as we discuss below we utilize thirdparty manufacturers located in the far east to produce our products these sales and manufacturing operations including operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to the risks associated with international operations including            currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations            limitations on the repatriation of earnings            potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions which can materially increase our taxes and other costs of doing business            political instability civil unrest and economic instability            greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights            complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of laws and regulations and related enforcement            difficulties understanding the retail climate consumer trends local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from the united states            natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom            transportation delays and interruptions            difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another including port congestion strikes and other transportation delays and interruptions            increased investment and operational complexity to make our products compatible with systems in various countries and compliant with local laws            changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally and            the imposition of tariffs quotas or other protectionist measures  because of the importance of our international sales sourcing and manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business    18    table of contents other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate including rising commodity and fuel prices higher labor costs increased transportation costs outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability  various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and costeffective manner or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues profitability and business  significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary brandedplay entertainment products we offer as we discussed above weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts natural disasters increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability  our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business  other conditions such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic a natural disaster or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product any of these factors could result in product delays increased costs andor lost sales for our products  we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties  in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by third parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as marvel star wars sesame street disney princess frozen  trolls or yokaiwatch related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties  the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 27 2015 we had 1244 million of prepaid royalties 475 million of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 768 million of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 27 2015 we may be required to pay additional future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 4264 million acquiring or renewing    19    table of contents  licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainmentbased properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy game or other family entertainment products and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us  we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed  our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce our products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business  with the sale of our remaining manufacturing facilities in 2015 all of our products are now manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of which are located in china should changes be necessary our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a significant period of time to alternative sources of supply if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political civil labor or other factors beyond our control including natural disasters or pandemics our operations may be substantially disrupted potentially for a significant period of time this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured  given that our toy manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of whom are located in china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings  factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china labor shortages and increases in labor costs in china as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in china out of asia and through the ports in north america and europe whether due to port congestion labor disputes slow downs product regulations andor inspections or other factors prolonged disputes or slowdowns at the west coast port can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the united states natural disasters or health pandemics impacting china can also have a significant negative impact on our business further the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations by the united states or the european union against products imported by us from or the loss of normal trade relations status with china could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a thirdparty manufacturer by government inspectors in china could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales  we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions our global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition we require that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right and exercises such right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these    20    table of contents  requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us  if we are unable to successfully adapt to the evolution of gaming our revenues and profitability may decline  recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful in the gaming business in the future we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business the objective of this plan was to stabilize our gaming business in 2012 and to position it to grow over the longterm our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involves substantial changes in how we market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail a focus on understanding consumer insights and in delivering industry leading innovation in gaming a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming our strategy also involves making changes in how we design and develop our gaming products we recognize the need to provide immersive game play that is easy for consumers to learn and play in shorter periods of time as well as offer innovative face to face off the board and digital gaming opportunities people are gaming in greater numbers than ever before but the nature of gaming has and continues to evolve quickly to be successful our gaming offerings must evolve to anticipate and meet these changes in consumer gaming our failure to successfully implement our strategy and to keep up with the evolution of gaming could substantially harm our business resulting in lost revenues and lost profits  our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees  our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our efforts it is their skill innovation and hard work that drive our success we compete with many other potential employers in recruiting hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees around the world there is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit hire or retain the senior management officers and other employees we need to succeed additionally we have experienced significant changes in our workforce from our restructuring efforts and the recruitment and hiring of new skill sets required for our changing global business we have added hundreds of employees in our global markets in licensing and in entertainment and storytelling capabilities while reducing our overall workforce over the last several years these changes in employee composition both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets has required changes in our business our loss of key management or other employees or our inability to hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our changing business could significantly harm our business  to remain competitive we must continuously work to increase efficiency and reduce costs but there is no guarantee we will be successful in this regard  our business is extremely competitive the pace of change in our industry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable to compete we must continuously improve our processes increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses we intend to achieve this partly by focusing on fewer more global brand initiatives and through process improvements including in global product development however these actions are no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings goal and we may realize fewer benefits than are expected from this initiative  our business is critically dependent on our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully  our intellectual property including our trademarks and tradenames copyrights patents and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property is of critical value we rely on a combination of trade secret    21    table of contents  copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the united states and around the world from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in the united states and around the world in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources similarly third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products or other intellectual property our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position  we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our net earnings  much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets however as of december 27 2015 we had 2808 million of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results  we rely on external financing including our credit facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed  due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our commercial paper program revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a commercial paper program which subject to market conditions and availability under our committed revolving credit facility allows us to issue up to 7000 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity there is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms or at all at any given point in time  we also have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2020 which provides for a 7000 million committed revolving credit facility and a further source of working capital funding and liquidity this facility also supports borrowings under our commercial paper program the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations  not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding  we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and    22    table of contents  prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities  as of december 27 2015 we had 15599 million of total principal amount of longterm debt outstanding if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all  as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business  as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the united states under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities advertising to children is subject to regulation by the federal trade commission the federal communications commission and a host of other agencies globally and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions of the childrens online privacy protection act and other privacy laws around the world while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these acts could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations  governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business  as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization  acquisitions and investments have been a component of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings in reviewing potential acquisitions or investments we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or offerings the ability for us to leverage our family entertainment offerings and opportunities to drive our strategic brand blueprint or other synergies in the case of our joint venture with discovery we looked to partner with a company that has shown    23    table of contents  the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels additionally through our acquisition of a 70 interest in backflip studios we looked to strengthen our mobile gaming expertise however we cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products or to grow our business in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products or services in the future there is no guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources which may negatively impact other aspects of our business  failure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability  we rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including product development management of our supply chain sale and delivery of our products financial reporting and various other processes and transactions we are critically dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses malware and other security breaches catastrophic events such as hurricanes fires floods earthquakes tornadoes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability  if our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed  we maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world this data relates to all aspects of our business including current and future products and entertainment under development and also contains certain customer consumer supplier partner and employee data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data in addition we provide confidential and proprietary information to our thirdparty business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data any compromise of the confidential data of our customers consumers suppliers partners employees or ourselves or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations harm our customers consumers and other business partners damage our reputation violate applicable laws and regulations and subject us to additional costs and liabilities and loss of business that could be material  from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense  as a large multinational corporation we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by    24    table of contents  the users of products that have been or may be developed by us as well as claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties property or rights because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in a significant number of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations  changes in or differing interpretations of income tax laws and rules and changes in our geographic operating results may impact our effective tax rate  we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various international tax jurisdictions we also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate there is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in or the interpretation of tax laws or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive or are determined to derive by tax authorities from jurisdictions with differing tax rates unanticipated changes in our tax rate could impact our results of operations in addition we may be subject to tax examinations by federal state and international jurisdictions and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying we assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties at december 27 2015 we have a liability for uncertain tax benefits of 683 million while we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits or results of possible current or future tax examinations may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results  we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net earnings  goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment at december 27 2015 5927 million or 125 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations included in goodwill is 1191 million related to backflip should backflip not achieve its profitability and growth targets including anticipated game releases in 2016 the carrying value may become impaired      item 1b unresolved staff comments  none      item 2 properties  hasbro owns its corporate

higher longterm receivables related to multiyear television distribution agreements these increases were partially offset by lower longterm royalty advances other assets decreased approximately 9 in 2014 compared to 2013 this decrease primarily relates to the partial sale of the companys investment in the network and to a lesser extent lower longterm prepaid royalties which have been reclassified from noncurrent to current or have been earned these decreases were partially offset by higher favorable balances related to foreign currency hedging contracts  accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased 10 in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher accrued royalties for licensed properties reflecting 2015s stronger entertainment lineup compared to 2014 as well as higher

the sale of certain intellectual property licensing rights which was included in other investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows the higher utilization in 2013 reflects the companys acquisition of a majority stake in backflip for 1100 million net of cash acquired as well as a payment related to an existing intellectual property  the company commits to inventory production advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in their holiday selling season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year this timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary for the company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part of the year during 2015 2014 and 2013 the company primarily used cash from operations and borrowings under its commercial paper program and available lines

policies and significant estimates  the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial    47    table of contents  statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the companys reported financial results include sales allowances program production costs recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments pension costs and obligations and income taxes  sales allowances  sales allowances for customer promotions discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment revenue from product sales less related sales allowances along with license fees and royalty revenue comprise net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts certain of the allowances such as the returns allowance are based on market data historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation  for its allowance programs that are not fixed such as returns the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues during 2015 there were no material adjustments to the companys estimates made in prior years  program production costs  the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs and films based primarily on the companys toy and game brands these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that impairment may exist the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on managements future revenue and cost estimates  the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individualfilmforecast method ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the film or television program and include toy game and other consumer product licensing fees first run program distribution fees and other revenue sources such as dvd and digital distribution our ultimate revenue estimates for each film or television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information when estimates for a film or television program are revised the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our films and television programs in the us which are primarily distributed on discovery family channel globally to other broadcasters and available on netflix and itunes and success of our programrelated toy game and other merchandise  for the year ended december 27 2015 we have 755 million of program production and film costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets we currently expect that a significant portion of capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3year period 2016 through 2018 future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and managements then    48    table of contents  current estimates of ultimate revenues during 2014 and 2013 the company recorded accelerated amortization on certain television programming based on revised ultimate expected revenues  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the company may perform a qualitative assessment and bypass the quantitative twostep impairment process if it is not more likely than not that impairment exists  performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill requires a high degree of judgment regarding assumptions underlying the valuation qualitative factors and their impact on critical inputs are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if it is more likely than not that impairment exists the quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test is performed when performing the quantitative twostep impairment test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is calculated using an income approach during the fourth quarter of 2015 the company performed a qualitative assessment with respect to certain of its reporting units with goodwill totaling 4736 million the company utilized this approach for all reporting units with the exception of backflip based on the amount by which historical estimated reporting unit fair values exceeded carrying values based on its qualitative assessment the company concluded that there was no impairment of this goodwill during 2015 the company has 1191 million of goodwill related to its 2013 acquisition of backflip which represents a separate reporting unit the companys strategy when it purchased its interest in backflip was to produce game titles based on backflips dragonvale brand and to develop and market games based on hasbro brands because backflip was a recent acquisition and to date has been investment spending in anticipation of 2016 game releases the company performed the quantitative twostep impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2015 for this reporting unit the impairment test utilized cash flows expected to be generated from mobile gaming offerings including 2016 releases based on backflips dragonvale brand as well as several hasbro brandedgame titles the underlying cash flows are based on longterm financial plans for backflip which include projections for growth in revenues and profitability the company used a discount rate commensurate with the digital gaming industry based on the results of the impairment test the company concluded that there was no impairment as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value the fair value would have to decline by 20 in order for this asset to be impaired should backflip not achieve its profitability and growth targets including the anticipated game releases in 2016 or if industry discount rates significantly increase the carrying value of this reporting unit may become impaired  the company also performed quantitative annual impairment tests related to intangible assets totaling 757 million with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of 2015 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values of the related assets  the estimation of future cash flows utilized in the evaluation of the companys goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge  intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the    49    table of contents  estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective assets and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 2051 million at december 27 2015 during 2015 there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets  recoverability of royalty advances and commitments  the companys ability to earnout royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the nonrecoverable minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 27 2015 the company had 1243 million of prepaid royalties 475 million of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 768 million of which are included in other assets during 2015 there were no significant charges related to this policy  pension costs and obligations  pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the us with no future benefits accruing to employees during 2015 the company froze benefits under its other funded us pension plan the company will continue to pay benefits under the plans consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze the company uses its fiscal yearend date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year  the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the companys estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2015 pension expense for the us plans was 700 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2015 pension expense for us plans by approximately 07 million  discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the companys weighted average discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2015 pension expense was 419 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the companys discount rate would have increased 2015 pension expense by approximately 05 million  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods at december 27 2015 the companys us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of 1205 million included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to 1240 million at december 28 2014 the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december 27 2015 increased to    50    table of contents  458 from 419 used at december 28 2014 a decrease of 025 in the companys discount rate would have increased the 2015 projected benefit obligation by approximately 109 million pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains  income taxes  the companys annual income tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the companys annual tax rate and evaluates its tax positions despite the companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges these estimated liabilities as well as the related interest are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit  an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the companys interim results in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the companys interim results the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time in addition changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs during 2014 the company recorded a net benefit of approximately 200 million associated with discrete tax events primarily related to the completion of us and mexico tax examinations as well as certain other us and foreign prior period tax adjustments during 2014 the company paid approximately 650 million to settle tax assessments and years subject to audit from 2000 through 2013 in mexico the company incurred additional tax expense in 2014 of 69 million related to this settlement  in certain cases tax law requires items to be included in the companys income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the consolidated financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the consolidated financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on the companys tax returns while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time such as depreciation expense these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the companys income tax returns valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income including capital gains to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the companys income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the companys consolidated financial statements or income recognized in the consolidated financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the companys income tax return deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as most of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company in the event the company determines that such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax rates of the international subsidiaries at december 27 2015 the difference between the tax in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries on cumulative undistributed earnings was approximately 5480 million    51    table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments  in the normal course of

agreement related to marvel as such amounts are contingent on the quantity and type of theatrical movie releases and may be payable during the next six years the company expects to pay approximately 400 million of these additional royalties in 2016 based on expected qualifying theatrical releases  the table above also excludes 1000 million in guaranteed royalties related to the companys license agreement related to star wars as the amount and timing of such payments are due in accordance with the anticipated releases of new star wars theatrical releases in 2017 and beyond  other expected future payments  from time to time the company may be party to arrangements contractual or otherwise whereby the company may not be able to estimate the ultimate timing or amount of the related

will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above  financial risk management  the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars and hong kong dollars while marketing and selling those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real russian ruble and mexican peso and to a lesser extent other currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries  to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate 1246 million decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions  the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the companys revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans

the retail sector revenues from the companys top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 39 of its consolidated net revenues in 2015 and 38 and 39 of its consolidated net revenues in 2014 and 2013 respectively the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate  the companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2015 approximately 66 of the companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas  quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in orders increasingly placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the companys future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the companys significant retailers could negatively impact the companys future revenues  the effect of inflation on the companys operations during 2015 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly  other information  the company is not aware of any

on the achievement by backflip of certain predetermined financial performance metrics the metrics because the company does not know the ultimate timing that these metrics may be met and thereby cannot currently estimate the purchase price of the remaining 30 the value reported reflects the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest on the date of acquisition which has been adjusted for cumulative earnings losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest since the date of acquisition as well as capital contributions made by or distributions made to the noncontrolling interest since the acquisition  property plant and equipment net  property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is computed using accelerated and straightline methods to depreciate the cost of property plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives the principal lives in years used in determining depreciation rates of various assets are land improvements 15 to 19 buildings and improvements 15 to 25 and machinery and equipment including computer hardware and software 3 to 12 depreciation expense is classified in the consolidated statements of operations based on the nature of the property and equipment being depreciated tools dies and molds are depreciated over a threeyear period or their useful lives whichever is less using an accelerated method the company generally owns all tools dies and molds related to its products  property plant and equipment net is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value wherein the fair value is the appraised value furthermore assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of the net book value or their estimated fair value less disposal costs  goodwill and other intangibles net  goodwill results from acquisitions the company has made over time substantially all of the other intangibles consist of the cost of acquired product rights in establishing the value of such rights the company considers existing trademarks copyrights patents license agreements and other productrelated rights these rights were valued on their acquisition date based on the anticipated future cash flows from the underlying product line the company has certain intangible assets related to the tonka and milton bradley acquisitions that have an indefinite life  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units this quantitative twostep process begins with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists when performing the quantitative twostep impairment test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value also calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows    63    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data    the company may bypass the quantitative twostep impairment process and perform a qualitative assessment if it is not more likely than not that impairment exists performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill requires a high degree of judgment regarding assumptions underlying the valuation qualitative factors and their impact on critical inputs are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  during the fourth quarter of 2015 the company performed a qualitative assessment with respect to goodwill associated with all but one of its reporting units and determined that it was not necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for the goodwill of these reporting units the company also performed quantitative twostep annual impairment tests related to its intangible assets with indefinite lives as well as goodwill associated with backflip the companys majority owned mobile gaming reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2015 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were in excess of the carrying value of the related intangible assets or reporting units as applicable  the remaining intangibles having defined lives are being amortized over periods ranging from four to twenty years primarily using the straightline method at december 27 2015 approximately 7 of other intangibles net are being amortized in proportion to actual and projected revenues  the company reviews other intangibles with defined lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value wherein that fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  financial instruments  hasbros financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable shortterm borrowings accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities at december 27 2015 the carrying cost of these instruments approximated their fair value the companys financial instruments at december 27 2015 also include longterm borrowings see note 9 for carrying cost and related fair values as well as certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value see notes 9 12 and 16  in april 2015 the fasb issued

materials labor tooling manufacturing overheads and other inventoryrelated costs such as obsolescence  royalties  the company enters into license agreements with strategic partners inventors designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in its products these agreements may call for payment in advance or future payment of minimum guaranteed amounts amounts paid in advance are recorded as an asset and charged to expense when the related revenue is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations if all or a portion of the minimum guaranteed amounts appear not to be recoverable through future use of the rights obtained under the license the nonrecoverable portion of the guaranty is charged to expense at that time  advertising  production costs of commercials are expensed in the fiscal year during which the production is first aired the costs of other advertising and promotion programs are expensed in the fiscal year incurred  program production costs  the company incurs costs in connection with the production of television programming and motion pictures these costs are capitalized by the company as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of such period related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that impairment may exist the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on managements future revenue and cost estimates  shipping and handling  hasbro expenses costs related to the shipment and handling of goods to customers as incurred for 2015 2014 and 2013 these costs were 159854 157326 and 155316 respectively and are included in selling distribution and administration expenses  operating leases  hasbro records lease expense on a straightline basis inclusive of rent concessions and increases reimbursements from lessors for leasehold improvements are deferred and recognized as a reduction to lease expense over the remaining lease term    65    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data    income taxes  hasbro uses the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes deferred taxes are measured using rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will be unrealized deferred income taxes have not been provided on the majority of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as the majority of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company  the company uses a twostep process for the measurement of uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is a determination of whether the tax position should be recognized in the consolidated financial statements the second step determines the measurement of the tax position the company records potential interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense  in november 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201517 income taxes asc 740 which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by removing the requirement to bifurcate deferred income tax assets and liabilities between current and noncurrent while asu 201517 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 it is eligible for early adoption the company elected early adoption and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets this adoption was applied retrospectively and 75595 has been reclassified from prepaid expenses and other current assets to other assets and 3250 has been reclassified from accrued liabilities to other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 28 2014  foreign currency translation  foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at periodend exchange rates and revenues costs and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates during each reporting period net earnings include gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions and when required translation gains and losses resulting from the use of the us dollar as the functional currency in highly inflationary economies other gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements are a component of other comprehensive earnings loss  pension plans postretirement and postemployment benefits  pension expense and related amounts in the consolidated balance sheets are based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods the companys policy is to fund amounts which are required by applicable regulations and which are tax deductible in 2016 the company expects to contribute approximately 3600 to its pension plans the estimated amounts of future payments to be made under other retirement programs are being accrued currently over the period of active employment and are also included in pension expense hasbro has a contributory postretirement health and life insurance plan covering substantially all employees who retire under any of its united states defined benefit pension plans and meet certain age and length of service requirements the cost of providing these benefits on behalf of employees who retired prior to 1993 is and will continue to be substantially borne by the company the cost of providing benefits on behalf of substantially all employees who retire after 1992 is borne by the employee it also has several plans covering certain groups of employees which may    66    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data     provide benefits to such employees following their period of employment but prior to their retirement the company measures the costs of these obligations based on actuarial computations  stockbased compensation  the company has a stockbased employee compensation plan for employees and nonemployee members of the companys board of directors under this plan the company may grant stock options at or above the fair market value of the companys stock as well as restricted stock restricted stock units and contingent stock performance awards all awards are measured at fair value at the date of the grant and amortized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award for awards contingent upon company performance the measurement of the expense for these awards is based on the companys current estimate of its performance over the performance period for awards contingent upon the achievement of market conditions the probability of satisfying the market condition is considered in the estimation of the grant date fair value see note 13 for further discussion  risk management contracts  hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and projected future foreign currency transactions these overthecounter contracts which hedge future purchases of inventory and other crossborder currency requirements not denominated in the functional currency of the business unit are primarily denominated in united states and hong kong dollars as well as euros all contracts are entered into with a number of counterparties all of which are major financial institutions the company believes that a default by a counterparty would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company hasbro does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes  at the inception of the contracts hasbro designates its derivatives as either cash flow or fair value hedges the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions all hedges designated as cash flow hedges are linked to forecasted transactions and the company assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis the effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction the ineffective portion of a hedging derivative if any is immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of operations  the company records all derivatives such as foreign currency exchange contracts on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges and are effective are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss earnings aoce until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations the companys foreign currency contracts hedging anticipated cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges when it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively any gain or loss deferred through that date remains in aoce until the forecasted transaction occurs at which time it is reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations to the extent the transaction is no longer deemed probable of occurring hedge accounting treatment is discontinued and amounts deferred would be reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations in the event hedge accounting requirements are not met gains and losses on such instruments are included currently in the consolidated statements of operations the company uses derivatives to economically hedge intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies the company does not use hedge accounting for these contracts as changes in the fair value of these contracts are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the intercompany loans  prior to the issuance of the notes due 2021 and notes due 2044 the company entered into a forwardstarting interest rate swap contract to hedge the anticipated us treasury interest rates on the anticipated debt    67    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data     issuance these instruments which were designated and effective as hedges were terminated on the date of the related debt issuance and the then fair value of these instruments was recorded to aoce and is being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method over the life of the related debt  net earnings per common share  basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year as well as awards that have not been issued but all contingencies have been met diluted net earnings per share is similar except that the weighted average number of shares outstanding is increased by dilutive securities and net earnings are adjusted if necessary for certain amounts related to dilutive securities dilutive securities include shares issuable upon exercise of stock options for which the market price exceeds the exercise price less shares which could have been purchased by the company with the related proceeds dilutive securities also include shares issuable under restricted stock unit award agreements there were no antidilutive stock options or restricted stock unit awards to exclude from the diluted earnings per share calculation in 2015 options and restricted stock unit awards totaling 674 and 760 for 2014 and 2013 respectively were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because to include them would have been antidilutive  a reconciliation of net earnings and average number of shares for each of the three fiscal years ended december 27 2015
