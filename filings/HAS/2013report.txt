electronic arts inc ea which provides ea the exclusive worldwide rights subject to existing limitations on our rights and certain other exclusions to create digital games based on a number of our

jagex for an online transformers game for western markets and with callaway digital arts for the mr potato head mobile app we also license our brands to third parties engaged in other forms of gaming  to support our strategic objective of further developing our brands through television entertainment we established a whollyowned television studio hasbro studios which produces television programming primarily based on our brands which is distributed on a global basis in addition hasbro studios has a coordinated development process which aligns with our 50 interest in a joint venture with discovery that operates a television network in the united states the hub the hub is dedicated to providing highquality childrens and family entertainment and educational programming  in addition to the above we also seek to promote and leverage our brands through major motion pictures in july 2011 transformers dark of the moon the third major motion picture based on the transformers brand was released in may 2012 battleship was released by universal pictures in    4    table of contents  2013 gi joe retaliation the second major motion picture based on the gi joe brand is scheduled to be released by paramount pictures the company has motion picture projects based on other brands in development for potential release in future years  major motion pictures and television programming based on our owned and controlled brands provide our consumers with the ability to experience these properties in a different format which we believe can result in increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related dvd releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from toy and game product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment and licensing segment  global operations  in our global operations segment we manufacture and source production of substantially all of our toy and game products the company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland which predominantly produce game products sourcing of our other production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see manufacturing and importing below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing  other information  to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer is located  certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence  each of our four product categories namely boys girls games and preschool generates greater than 10 of our net revenues for more information including the amount of net revenues attributable to each of our four product categories see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k  working capital requirements  our working capital needs are financed primarily through cash generated from operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings our borrowings generally reach peak levels during the third or fourth quarter of each year this corresponds to the time of year when our receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of the production and shipment of product in preparation for the holiday season the strategy of retailers has generally been to make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy our historical revenue pattern is one in which the second half of the year is more significant to our overall business than the first half in 2012 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 64 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for 33 and 31 of full year revenues respectively  the toy and game business is also characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions as a result comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response inventory management practices result in fewer orders being placed significantly in advance of shipment and more orders being placed for immediate delivery retailers generally time their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of    5    table of contents  purchase by consumers although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is a general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are indicative of future sales the types of programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2013 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2012  historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2012 we utilized cash from our operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements  royalties and product development  our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our entertainment offerings including both the continuing development of new brands and products and the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy and game products are developed by a global development group and the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in 2012 2011 and 2010 we incurred expenses of 201197 197638 and 201358 respectively on activities relating to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers  in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees  we also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements  in 2012 2011 and 2010 we incurred 302066 339217 and 248570 respectively of royalty expense our royalty expense in any given year may vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media  marketing and sales  as we are focused on reimagining reinventing and reigniting our many brands and imagining inventing and igniting new brands we have a global marketing function which establishes brand direction and messaging as well as assists the selling entities in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments we also maintain sales and marketing functions in our selling entities who are responsible for local market activities and execution our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased etailers our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products remaining sales are generated by independent distributors who sell our products for the most part in    6    table of contents  areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence while we have thousands of customers there has been significant consolidation at the retail level over the last several years in our industry as a result the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers while the consolidation of customers provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this consolidation also creates additional risks to our business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with us in addition customer concentration may decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2012 net revenues from our three largest customers walmart stores inc toys r us inc and target corporation represented 17 11 and 10 respectively of consolidated net revenues and sales to our top five customers including walmart toys r us inc and target accounted for approximately 42 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 64 of our net revenues were derived from these top three customers  we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television in addition we engage in digital marketing and advertising for our brands generally our advertising highlights selected items in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote the sale of not only the selected item but also other items we offer in those product groups as well hasbro studios produces television entertainment based primarily on our brands which appears on the hub in the us other major networks internationally as well as on various other digital platforms such as netflix and itunes we introduce many of our new products to major customers during the year prior to the year of introduction of such products for retail sale in addition we showcase certain of our new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows in 2012 2011 and 2010 we incurred 422239 413951 and 420651 respectively in expense related to advertising and promotion programs certain entertainmentbased products such as products based on major motion pictures generally do not require the same level of advertising that we spend on other nonentertainment based products  manufacturing and importing  during 2012 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in our two owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland  most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year our manufacturing processes and those of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly the countries of the far east and particularly china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us we purchase most of our raw materials and component parts used in our owned manufacturing facilities from suppliers in the united states and certain other countries  we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers together with our own facilities as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2013 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured and production shifted to those new sources the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or    7    table of contents  the loss of normal trade relations status with china or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china such as higher chinese labor costs or an appreciation in the chinese yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured in china and imported into other markets  competition  we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of toys and games and other entertainment offerings but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with companies that offer branded entertainment focused on children and their families competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing in entertainment hasbro studios and the hub compete with other childrens television networks and entertainment producers such as nickelodeon cartoon network and disney channel for viewers advertising revenue and distribution  in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and branded play entertainment companies in our business we must deal with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and many children have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age and the array of products and entertainment offerings competing for the attention of children has greatly expanded we refer to this as children getting older younger as a result our products not only compete with the offerings of other toy and game manufacturers but we must compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with the entertainment offerings of many other companies such as makers of tablets video games and other consumer electronic products  the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment low barriers to entry and new technologies continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings  employees  at december 30 2012 we employed approximately 5500 persons worldwide approximately 2800 of whom were located in the united states during the fourth quarter of 2012 we announced a cost savings initiative that is expected to result in an overall reduction in our global workforce by approximately 10 primarily during 2013  trademarks copyrights and patents  we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect  government regulation  our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the cpsa the federal hazardous substances act the fhsa the flammable fabrics act the ffa and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition certain of our products such as the mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration  the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the cpsc to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product a banned hazardous substance under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an    8    table of contents  imminently hazardous consumer product under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned  consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many international markets including canada australia and europe we utilize laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa other

making it difficult to design and develop products which will be popular with children and families  the interests of children and families evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year to be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content products and play patterns which will capture childrens and families interests and imagination and quickly develop innovative products which can compete successfully for consumers limited time attention and spending this challenge is more difficult with the ever increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers evolving consumer tastes coupled with an ever changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for childrens and families interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced as a result individual family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles if we devote time and resources to developing entertainment and products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in significant quantities to be profitable to us our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will be damaged  additionally our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our entertainment and consumer product offerings by consumers in diverse markets around the world with different tastes and preferences as such our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience  the challenge of continuously developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of todays children and the increasing array of entertainment offerings available to them  children are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative technologydriven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies digital media and social media companies to meet this challenge we and our competitors are designing and marketing products which incorporate increasing technology seek to combine digital and analog play and capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media  with the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings there is no guarantee that            any of our brands products or product lines will achieve popularity or continue to be popular            any property for which we have a significant license will achieve or sustain popularity            any new products or product lines we introduce will be considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate market acceptance or            any products life cycle or sales quantities will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover our development manufacturing marketing royalties including royalty advances and guarantees and other costs of producing marketing and selling the product  the childrens and family entertainment industry is highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our revenues market share and profitability could decline  the childrens and family entertainment industry is and will continue to be highly competitive we compete in the united states and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers marketers and sellers of analog toys and games digital gaming products digital media products which combine analog and digital play and other entertainment and consumer products as well as with retailers we face competitors who    11    table of contents  are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase  in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the childrens and family entertainment industry are low and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets and has broadened the array of companies we compete with new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time these existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences our competitors products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products lower our revenues and lower our profitability  an inability to develop and introduce planned new brands products and product lines in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business  in developing new brands products and product lines we have anticipated dates for the associated product introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development implementation and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule there is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a costeffective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands this risk is heightened by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business the risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies utilizing digital media to a greater degree and providing greater innovation and product differentiation unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process significant increases in the planned cost of development or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or in some situations may cause a product introduction to be discontinued  united states global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers can harm our business and financial performance  we design manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate recessions credit crises and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the united states and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence similarly reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers such as their homes or stock market investments can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability  in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending andor sales allowances or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability    12    table of contents challenging market conditions in certain developed markets such as in the united states and certain western european countries make it more difficult for us to succeed  our future success in the united states and europe is impacted by market conditions a european sovereign debt crisis or other significant negative shock to european markets could lead to a recession in europe which may negatively impact consumers and in turn sales of our products in the european markets similar negative events impacting the market in the united states may harm our business  many components of the toy game and family entertainment industries in the united states and certain western european countries have not grown or in some cases have even contracted in recent years these markets represent a majority of our current product sales it is more difficult for us to grow or even maintain our business when the overall market in certain of the major countries we serve is not growing to succeed in a market that is stable or contracting we must gain market share from our competitors which is more difficult than growing in an expanding market as long as economic conditions in the united states and certain european markets remain difficult this will be an additional challenge we must face and overcome  loss of a significant licensed property could harm our business  in addition to developing and marketing products based on properties we own or control we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties  we currently have inlicenses to several successful entertainment properties including marvel star wars beyblade and sesame street these licenses typically have multiyear terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products in recent years our sales of products under the marvel star wars beyblade and sesame street licenses have been highly significant to our business if any of these licenses were to terminate and not be renewed or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license  our license to the marvel property is granted from marvel entertainment llc and marvel characters bv together marvel our license to the star wars property is granted by lucas licensing ltd and lucasfilm ltd together lucas both marvel and lucas are owned by the walt disney company  delays or increased costs associated with the development and offering of entertainment media based upon or related to our brands can harm our business and profitability  entertainment media in forms such as television motion pictures dvd releases and other media can provide popular platforms for consumers to experience our owned and licensed brands and the success or lack of success of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial success we spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties heavily impact the timing of media development release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts  the ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors and studio and media partners we do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit or released and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates this can make it difficult for us to plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture and other media releases given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts  when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business    13    table of contents lack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainment media for which we offer products can harm our business  motion pictures television or other media for which we develop products may not be as popular with consumers as we anticipated while it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of media efforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings if our and our partners media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed  the hub our cable television joint venture with discovery communications inc in the united states competes with a number of other childrens television networks for viewers advertising revenue and distribution fees there is no guarantee that the hub will be successful similarly hasbro studios programming distributed internationally competes with programming from many other parties lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of programming developed by hasbro studios or other programming appearing on the hub and products related to that programming could significantly harm our business similarly our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with our investment in the hub such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for the hub during 2012 the company paid 59277 for programming developed by hasbro studios and anticipates that it will continue spending at comparable levels in 2013 and future years  at december 30 2012 330746 or 76 of our total assets represented our investment in the hub if the hub does not achieve success or if there are subsequent declines in the success or profitability of the channel then our investment may become impaired which could result in a writedown through net earnings  part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporating greater technology and which marry digital and analog play the margins on many of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have short lifespans  as children have grown older younger and have otherwise become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products such as video games consumer electronics and social and digital media at younger and younger ages we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers one initiative we have pursued to capture the interest of children is to offer innovative childrens electronic toy and game products increasing the marriage between digital and analog gaming and increasing the technology in our gaming products is another key for our future strategy these electronic and digital products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales however childrens electronic and digital products in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks  our costs for designing developing and producing electronic and digital products or products that marry digital and analog technology tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions as a consequence our margins on the sales of these products can be lower than for more traditional products and we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games    14    table of contents other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate including rising commodity and fuel prices higher labor costs increased transportation costs outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability  various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and costeffective manner or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues profitability and business  significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary branded play entertainment products we offer as we discussed above weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability  our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business  other conditions such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product any of these factors could result in product delays increased costs andor lost sales for our products  our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations  we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 30 2012 our net revenues from international customers comprised approximately 50 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in fact over time we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets additionally as we discuss below we utilize thirdparty manufacturers located principally in the far east to produce the majority of our products and we have a manufacturing facility in ireland these sales and manufacturing operations including operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to the risks associated with international operations including            currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations            limitations on the repatriation of earnings            potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions            political instability civil unrest and economic instability            greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights            complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies    15    table of contents         difficulties understanding the retail climate consumer trends local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from the united states            natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom            difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another including port congestion strikes and other transportation delays and interruptions            changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally and            the imposition of tariffs quotas or other protectionist measures  because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business  changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance  our global operations mean we produce and buy products and sell products in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies as a result if the exchange rate between the united states dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results as reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected as an example if the dollar appreciates 10 relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had 200 million of net revenues the dollar value of those sales as they are translated into us dollars would decrease by 20 million in our consolidated financial results as such we would recognize a 20 million decrease in our net revenues even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed similarly our expenses in foreign markets can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control  we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties  in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by third parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as marvel star wars beyblade or sesame street related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties  the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 30 2012 we had 163875 of prepaid royalties 86361 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 77514 of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 30 2012 we may be required to pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 227000 acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainmentbased properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy game or other family entertainment products and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us    16    table of contents we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed  our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season this seasonality is exacerbated by retailers quick response inventory management techniques  sales of our toys games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season including christmas this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailers investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier  the limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to fully meet consumer demand additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in our underproducing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season  the concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us  we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 30 2012 walmart stores inc toys r us inc and target corporation accounted for approximately 17 11 and 10 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart toys r us and target in the aggregate accounted for approximately 42 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 64 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of    17    table of contents  their purchases from us favor competitors or new entrants increase their direct competition with us by expanding their privatelabel business change their purchasing patterns alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products or return substantial amounts of our products it could significantly harm our sales profitability and financial condition customers make no binding longterm commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products in addition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers furthermore the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability  our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce the majority of our toy products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business  we own and operate two manufacturing facilities one in east longmeadow massachusetts and the other in waterford ireland however most of our products are manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers most of whom are located in the peoples republic of china china although our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a significant period of time to alternative sources of supply should such changes be necessary if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political civil labor or other factors beyond our control including natural disasters or pandemics our operations may be substantially disrupted potentially for a significant period of time this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured  given that the majority of our toy manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers located in china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china labor shortages and increases in labor costs in china as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in china out of asia and through the ports in north america and europe whether due to port congestion labor disputes product regulations andor inspections or other factors and natural disasters or health pandemics impacting china also the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations by the united states or the european union against products imported by us from or the loss of normal trade relations status with china could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a thirdparty manufacturer by government inspectors in china could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales  we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured by or for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions our global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition we require that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right and exercises such right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us    18    table of contents difficulties associated with the implementation of our plan to reinvent our gaming business may harm our revenues and profitability  recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful in the gaming business in the future we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business the objective of this plan was to stabilize our gaming business in 2012 and to position it to grow in 2013 and beyond our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involves substantial changes in how we market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail a focus on delivering industry leading innovation in gaming a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming we also are designing our gaming products to recognize the need to provide immersive game play in shorter periods of time and to offer innovative face to face and off the board gaming opportunities our failure to successfully implement our strategy to reinvent our gaming business and to otherwise stabilize and grow our gaming business in the future could substantially harm our business resulting in lost revenues and lost profits there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our global gaming strategy  our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees  our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our branded play efforts it is their skill innovation and hard work that drive our success we compete with many other potential employers in recruiting hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees there is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit hire or retain the senior management officers and other employees we need to succeed our loss of key management or other employees or our inability to hire talented people we need in the future could significantly harm our business  to remain competitive we must continuously work to increase efficiency and reduce costs but there is no guarantee we will be successful in this regard  our business is extremely competitive the pace of change in our industry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable to compete we must continuously improve our processes increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses to improve our profitability and competitiveness in the fourth quarter of 2012 we implemented a global cost savings initiative the objective of this initiative is to reduce our operating costs by an annual amount of 100 million by 2015 we intend to achieve this by focusing on fewer more global brand initiatives workforce reductions facility consolidation and other process improvements however this is no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings goals  we rely on external financing including our credit facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed  due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2017 which provides for a 700000 committed revolving credit facility the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations  we also have a commercial paper program which subject to market conditions allows us to issue up to 700000 in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a further source of working    19    table of contents  capital funding and liquidity there is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms or at all at any given point in time at december 30 2012 there was 209200 outstanding under this program  not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding  we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities  as of december 30 2012 we had 1384895 of total principal amount of longterm debt outstanding if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all  as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business  as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the united states under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities in addition advertising to children is subject to regulation by the federal trade commission the federal communications commission and a host of other agencies globally and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions of the childrens online privacy protection act while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these acts could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations  governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business    20    table of contents as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition  our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully in addition we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our net earnings  our intellectual property including our license agreements and other agreements that establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property is of great value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the united states and around the world from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in the united states and around the world in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and competitive position much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our balance sheet however as of december 30 2012 we had 416659 of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization  acquisitions have been a component of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings in making acquisitions we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings in the case of our joint venture with discovery we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels however we cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we may acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products or services in the future  failure to operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability  we rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including management of our supply chain sale and delivery of our products and various other process transactions we are dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as hurricanes fires floods earthquakes tornadoes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees the efficient    21    table of contents  operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability  if our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed  we maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world this data relates to all aspects of our business and also contains certain customer and consumer data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data in addition we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third party business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data any compromise of the confidential data of our customers our consumers or ourselves could have a negative effect on our business  from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense  as is the case with many large multinational corporations we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in significant numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations  we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net earnings  goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment at december 30 2012 474925 or 110 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations      item 1b unresolved staff comments  none      item 2 properties  hasbro owns its corporate headquarters in pawtucket rhode island consisting of

approximately 11900 and 4400 respectively due to the translation of foreign currencies to the us dollar in 2012 decreases in operating profit and operating profit margin were primarily due to lower net revenues discussed above in addition to higher selling distribution and administration expenses higher cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues was partially offset by lower royalty expense as a result of the mix of entertainmentbased and nonentertainment based product sales further the decline in operating profit margin in 2012 compared to 2011 reflects the change in geographical mix of net revenues with a higher percentage coming from emerging markets which currently have lower operating profit margins than the company has in developed markets in 2011 the increase in operating profit was primarily driven by the increased net revenues described above this was partially offset by higher royalty expense as a result of increased revenues from higher royaltybearing products

entertainment and licensing segment net revenues increased 12 in 2012 compared to 2011 and 19 in 2011 compared to 2010 increases for each year were primarily due to the sale and distribution of

properties such as transformers and beyblade products and net revenues from magic the gathering products in addition cost of sales was negatively impacted by unfavorable manufacturing variances as a result of reduced games production in 2011 while cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues of entertainmentbased products are generally lower than many of the companys other products sales from

accounting policies and significant estimates  the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the companys reported financial results include sales allowances program production costs recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments pension costs and obligations and income taxes  sales allowances  sales allowances for customer promotions discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment revenue from product sales less related sales allowances along with license fees and royalty revenue comprise net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts certain of the allowances such as the returns allowance are based on market data historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation  for its allowance programs that are not fixed such as returns the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues during 2012 there have been no material adjustments to the companys estimates made in prior years  program production costs  the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs based primarily on the companys toy and game brands including animated and liveaction programs and game shows these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on managements future revenue and cost estimates  the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individualfilmforecast method ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the television program and include toy game and other merchandise licensing fees first run program distribution fees and other revenue sources such as dvd and digital distribution our ultimate revenue estimates for each television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information if estimates for a television program are revised the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations in the    40    table of contents  quarter in which the estimates are revised prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our television programs in the us which are distributed on the hub and available on netflix and itunes our ability to achieve broad distribution and viewer acceptance in international markets and success of our programrelated toy game and other merchandise  for the year ended december 30 2012 we have 91975 of program production costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet we currently expect that substantially all capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3year period 2013 through 2015 future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and managements then current estimates of ultimate revenues during 2012 the company did not incur any significant impairment charges related to its program production costs  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows  the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach the companys annual goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the estimated fair value of the companys reporting units with allocated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying value no reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing the first step of the impairment test accordingly no impairment was indicated the companys annual impairment tests related to intangible assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth quarter of 2012 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying value of the related assets the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge at december 30 2012 the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of 550663 recorded on the balance sheet  intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 340921 at december 30 2012 during 2012 there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets    41    table of contents recoverability of royalty advances and commitments  the companys ability to earnout royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the nonrecoverable minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 30 2012 the company had 163875 of prepaid royalties 86361 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 77514 of which are included in other assets  pension costs and obligations  pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using

employees the company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze the estimates for the companys us plans are established at the companys measurement date the company uses its fiscal yearend date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year  the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the companys estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2012 pension expense for the us plans was 700 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2012 pension expense for us plans by approximately 650  discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the companys discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2012 pension expense averaged 496 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the companys discount rate would have increased 2012 pension expense by approximately 430  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods at december 30 2012 the companys us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of 138946 included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to 104872 at december 25 2011 the increase primarily reflects additional unrecognized actuarial losses in 2012 primarily due to the reduction of the discount rate used to measure plan obligations at december 30 2012 partially offset by the amount by which the companys 2012 actual return on plan assets exceeded the expected return assumed in the calculation of the 2012 expense the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december 30 2012 decreased to 409 at december 30 2012 from 496 used at december 25 2011 a decrease of 025 in the companys discount rate would have increased the 2012 projected benefit obligation by approximately 12026 pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains    42    table of contents income taxes  the companys annual income tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the companys annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions despite the companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges these estimated liabilities are adjusted as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit  an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the companys interim results in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the companys interim results the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time changes in the companys estimated effective income tax rate during 2012 were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction in addition changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs during 2012 the company recorded a total benefit of approximately 8300 associated with discrete tax events primarily related to the repatriation of certain highly taxed foreign earnings as well as expirations of statutes in multiple jurisdictions  in certain cases tax law requires items to be included in the companys income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on the companys tax returns while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time such as depreciation expense these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the companys income tax returns valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income including capital gains to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the companys income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the companys financial statements or income recognized in the financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the companys income tax return deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as most of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company in the event the company determines that such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries at december 30 2012 the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries on cumulative undistributed earnings was approximately 393000  the mexican government has a tax structure which results in companies paying the higher of an incomebased tax or an alternative flat tax should the company be subject to the alternative flat tax it would be required to review whether its net deferred tax assets would be realized as the company believes that it will continue to be subject to the incomebased tax in 2013 it believes that the net deferred tax assets related to the mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable should the facts and circumstances change the company may be required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its mexican operations which may result in additional tax expense at december 30 2012 these deferred tax assets were approximately 7300    43    table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments  in the normal course of its business the company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license which may require the

liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 30 2012 the company has a liability including potential interest and penalties of 123444 for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns the company does not know the ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability accordingly these amounts are not included in the table above  in connection with the companys agreement to form a joint venture with discovery the company is obligated to make future payments to discovery under a tax sharing agreement these payments are contingent upon the company having sufficient taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related to the joint venture accordingly estimates of these amounts are included in the table above  the companys agreement with marvel provides for minimum guaranteed royalty payments and requires the company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities in connection with the extension of the marvel license in 2009 the company may be subject to additional royalty guarantees totaling 140000 that are not included in the table above and that may be payable during the next six years contingent upon the quantity and types of theatrical movie releases approximately 30000 of these additional royalty guarantees are expected to be paid in 2013 based on the theatrical release of iron man 3  purchase commitments represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase inventory and tooling in the ordinary course of business the reported amounts exclude inventory and tooling purchase liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 30 2012  in addition to the amounts included in the table above the company expects to make contributions totaling approximately 5800 related to its unfunded us and other international pension plans in 2013 the company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately 194221 at december 30 2012  the company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above  financial risk management  the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars hong kong dollars and euros while marketing    44    table of contents  those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real russian ruble and mexican peso and to a lesser extent currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries  to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate 61622 decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions  the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the companys revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts  the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 30 2012 these contracts had net unrealized losses of 1720 of which 1729 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets 12 are recorded in other assets 3106 are recorded in accrued liabilities and 355 are recorded in other liabilities included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 30 2012 are deferred losses of 1008 net of tax related to these derivatives  at december 30 2012 the company had fixed rate longterm debt excluding adjustments of 1384895 the company was party to several interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 400000 to adjust the amount of longterm debt subject to fixed interest rates the interest rate swaps were matched with specific longterm debt issues and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt changes in fair value of these contracts were wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related longterm debt in november 2012 these interest rate swap agreements were terminated the fair value was recorded as an adjustment to longterm debt and is now being amortized through the statement of operations over the life of the remaining longterm debt using a straightline method at december 30 2012 this adjustment to longterm debt was 11526 as a result of this termination longterm debt is no longer affected by variable interest rates and thereby earnings and cash flows are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates the company estimates that a hypothetical quarter percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this longterm debt by approximately 31000  the economy and inflation  the principal market for the companys products is the retail sector revenues from the companys top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 42 of its consolidated net revenues in 2012 and 45 and 50 of its consolidated net revenues in 2011 and 2010 respectively in recent years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate  the companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2012 approximately 64 of the companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing    45    table of contents  strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas  quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the companys future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the companys significant retailers could negatively impact the companys future revenues  the effect of inflation on the companys operations during 2012 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly  other information  the company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters

are tested for impairment at least annually the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a twostep process that begins with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value also calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows  the remaining intangibles having defined lives are being amortized over periods ranging from five to twentyfive years primarily using the straightline method at december 30 2012 approximately 8 of other intangibles net related to digital gaming rights

not be recoverable recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values depending on the nature of the assets assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of the net book value or their estimated fair value less disposal costs  financial instruments  hasbros financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable shortterm borrowings accounts payable and certain accrued

the companys stock as well as restricted stock restricted stock units and contingent stock performance awards all awards are measured at fair value at the date of the grant and amortized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award for awards contingent upon company performance the measurement of the expense for these awards is based on the companys current estimate of its performance over the performance period see note 13 for further discussion  risk management contracts  hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and projected future foreign currency transactions these overthecounter contracts which hedge future purchases of inventory and other crossborder currency requirements not denominated in the functional currency of the business unit are primarily denominated in united states and hong kong dollars as well as euros and are entered into with a number of counterparties all of which are major financial institutions the company believes that a default by a counterparty would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company hasbro does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes  at the inception of the contracts hasbro designates its derivatives as either cash flow or fair value hedges the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions all hedges designated as cash flow hedges are linked to forecasted transactions and the company assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis the effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction the ineffective portion of a hedging derivative if any is immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of operations    57    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data    the company records all derivatives such as foreign currency exchange contracts on the balance sheet at fair value changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges and are effective are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss earnings aoce until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations the companys foreign currency contracts hedging anticipated cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges when it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively any gain or loss deferred through that date remains in aoce until the forecasted transaction occurs at which time it is reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations to the extent the transaction is no longer deemed probable of occurring hedge accounting treatment is discontinued and amounts deferred would be reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations in the event hedge accounting requirements are not met gains and losses on such instruments are included currently in the consolidated statements of operations the company uses derivatives to economically hedge intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies the company does not use hedge accounting for these contracts as changes in the fair value of these contracts are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the intercompany loans  the company also used interest rate swap agreements to adjust the amount of longterm debt subject to fixed interest rates the interest rate swaps were matched with specific fixed rate longterm debt obligations and designated as fair value hedges of the change in fair value of the related debt obligations these agreements were recorded at their fair value as an asset or liability gains and losses on these contracts were included in the consolidated statements of operations and wholly offset by changes in the fair value of the related longterm debt in november 2012 these interest rate swap agreements were terminated the realized gain on the interest rate swaps was recorded as an adjustment to longterm debt and is being amortized through the statement of operations over the term of the related longterm debt using a straightline method  net earnings per common share  basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year diluted net earnings per share is similar except that the weighted average number of shares outstanding is increased by dilutive securities and net earnings are adjusted for certain amounts related to dilutive securities dilutive securities include shares issuable upon exercise of stock options for which the market price exceeds the exercise price less shares which could have been purchased by the company with the related proceeds dilutive securities also include shares issuable under restricted stock unit award agreements in addition for the period that the companys convertible debt was outstanding dilutive securities included shares issuable under such debt

valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities  current accounting standards permit entities to
