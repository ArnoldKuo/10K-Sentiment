walk n ride and elefun busy ball popper  segments  organizationally our three principal segments are us and canada international and entertainment and licensing the us and canada and international segments engage in the marketing and selling of various toy and game products described above our toy and game products are primarily developed by crossfunctional teams including members of our global development and marketing groups to establish a cohesive brand direction and assist the segments in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of these groups are allocated to the principal segments our us and canada segment covers the united states and canada while the international segment primarily includes europe the asia pacific region and latin and south america the entertainment and licensing segment conducts our movie television and digital gaming entertainment operations including the operations of hasbro studios and backflip as well as engages in the outlicensing of our trademarks characters and other brand and intellectual property rights to third parties for noncompeting products our global operations segment is responsible for arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the us and canada and international segments financial information with respect to our segments and geographic areas is included in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k the following is a discussion of each segment  us and canada this segment engages in the marketing and sale of our products in the united states and canada the us and canada segment promotes our brands through innovation and reinvention of toys and games this is accomplished through introducing new products and initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and licenses this strategy leverages efforts to increase consumer awareness of the companys brands through entertainment experiences including motion pictures and television programming  international the international segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most countries in europe latin and south america and the asia pacific region and through distributors in those countries where we have no direct presence we have offices in more than 35 countries contributing to sales in more than 120 countries  in addition to growing brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses we seek to grow our international business by continuing to opportunistically expand into emerging markets in eastern europe asia and latin and south america emerging markets are an area of high priority for us as we believe they offer greater opportunities for revenue growth than developed markets key emerging markets include russia brazil and the peoples republic of china china and during 2015 we opened offices in south africa and thailand net revenues from emerging markets represented 14 of our total consolidated net revenues in 2015 in 2015 net revenues from emerging markets decreased 9 primarily due to a challenging foreign currency environment whereas 2014 and 2013 net revenues in emerging markets grew 20 and 25 respectively the strengthening of    4    table of contents  the us dollar had a significant impact on the international segment during 2015 the us dollar strengthened against nearly all of our major selling currencies including the brazilian real euro mexican peso and russian ruble the negative impact from foreign currency translation on international segment net revenues for 2015 and 2014 was 3794 million and 877 million respectively furthermore absent the negative impact of foreign currency net revenues from emerging markets grew approximately 15 financial information with respect to foreign currency risk management is included in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k  entertainment and licensing our entertainment and licensing segment includes our consumer products licensing digital gaming television and movie entertainment operations  our consumer products licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings such as apparel publishing home goods and electronics or in certain situations to utilize them for toy products where we consider the outlicensing of brands to be more effective  our digital gaming business seeks to promote our brands largely through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games for play on mobile devices personal computers and video game consoles based on those brands we have a 70 majority ownership in backflip a mobile game developer as we seek to complement the aforementioned outlicensing with the development of internal digital gaming resources backflips product offerings include games for tablets and mobile devices including the dragonvale game backflip intends to continue focusing on its existing game titles particularly dragonvale and to launch new games including game offerings based on hasbro brands to further extend its brands into digital media and gaming the company also outlicenses its properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games and other gaming experiences based on those brands the company has digital gaming relationships with electronic arts inc activision ubisoft and others lastly we also license our brands to third parties engaged in other forms of gaming including scientific games corporation  major motion pictures and television programming based on our owned and controlled brands provide both immersive storytelling and the ability for our consumers to experience these properties in a different format which we believe can result in increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related home entertainment releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from toy and game product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment and licensing segment  global operations our global operations segment sources production of our toy and game products through august 2015 the company owned and operated manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland which predominantly produced game products these facilities were sold to cartamundi nv cartamundi on august 31 2015 cartamundi will continue to manufacture game products for us under a manufacturing agreement sourcing for our other production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see manufacturing and importing below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing  other information to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer is geographically located  certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence    5    table of contents each of our four product categories namely boys games girls and preschool generate greater than 10 of our net revenues for more information including the amount of net revenues attributable to each of our four product categories see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k  working capital requirements  our working capital needs are financed through cash generated from operations primarily through the sale of toys and games and secondarily through our consumer products licensing operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings  our customer order patterns may vary from year to year largely due to fluctuations in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions as such a disproportionate volume of our net revenues are earned during the third and fourth quarters leading up to the retail industrys holiday selling season including christmas as a result comparisons of unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in the prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response or justintime inventory management practices result in a significant proportion of orders being placed for immediate delivery although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are indicative of future sales we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy as such our business generally earns more revenue in the second half of the year compared to the first half in 2015 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 66 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters each accounting for 33 of full year net revenues the types of programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2016 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2015 and in prior years  historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2015 we utilized cash from our operations borrowings under our commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements  product development and royalties  our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our brandedplay and entertainment offerings and requires continued development of new brands and products alongside the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy and game products are developed by a global development function the costs of which are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in 2015 2014 and 2013 we incurred expenses of 2429 million 2226 million and 2076 million respectively on activities related to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers  in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees    6    table of contents we also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements  in 2015 2014 and 2013 we incurred 3792 million 3053 million and 3389 million respectively of royalty expense in 2013 royalty expense included 638 million related to the settlement of an arbitration award for a dispute between the company and an inventor as well as costs related to the amendment of the companys license agreement with zynga our royalty expense in any given year may also vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media  marketing and sales  while our global development function focuses on brand and product innovation and reinvention our global marketing function establishes brand direction and messaging and assists the selling entities in establishing local marketing programs the global marketing group works crossfunctionally with the global development function to deliver unified brandspecific points of view the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in addition to the global marketing function our local selling entities employ sales and marketing functions responsible for local market activities and execution  our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores drug stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased etailers our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products with remaining sales generated by independent distributors who for the most part sell our products in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence notwithstanding our thousands of customers the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers customer concentration provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution practices and other reductions in costs of sales and distribution however customer concentration can also create additional risks for our business these risks can create potential detriments to our business resulting from the financial difficulties of our major customers which could lead to reductions in sales or unfavorable changes in our business relationships with one or more of our major customers customer concentration may also decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2015 net revenues from our top five customers accounted for approximately 39 of our consolidated global net revenues including our three largest customers walmart stores inc toys r us inc and target corporation who represented 16 9 and 9 respectively of consolidated global net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 59 of our net revenues were derived from these top three customers  we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television and through digital marketing and advertising of our brands products are strategically crosspromoted by spotlighting specific products alongside related offerings in a manner that promotes the sale of not only the selected item but also those complementary products in addition to those advertising initiatives hasbro studios produces entertainment based primarily on our brands which appears on discovery family channel and other major networks globally as well as on various other digital platforms such as netflix and itunes we also introduce many of our new products to major customers within one to two years leading up to their year of retail introduction we generally showcase certain new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows including in hong kong and nuremburg germany in 2015 2014 and 2013 we incurred 4094 million 4203 million and 3981 million respectively in expense related to advertising and promotional programs  manufacturing and importing  during 2015 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in two previously owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and    7    table of contents  waterford ireland these facilities were owned by the company through august 2015 at which point they were sold to cartamundi who will continue to manufacture game products for us under a manufacturing agreement  we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2016 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured and production shifted to those new sources the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of normal trade relations status with china or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china such as higher chinese labor costs or an appreciation in the chinese yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured in china and imported into other markets  most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year  the manufacturing processes of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly the countries of the far east particularly china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us  competition  we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of toys and games and other family entertainment offerings but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with other companies that offer branded entertainment specific to children and their families competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing in entertainment hasbro studios and discovery family channel compete with other childrens and family television networks and entertainment producers such as nickelodeon cartoon network and disney channel for viewers advertising revenue and distribution  in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and brandedplay entertainment companies we contend with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age thereby the variety of product and entertainment offerings available for children has expanded and product life cycles have shortened as children move on to more sophisticated offerings at younger ages this has been referred to as children getting older younger but may also be referred to as developmental compression as a result our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers and companies offering branded family entertainment we also compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with entertainment offerings of many technology companies such as makers of tablets mobile devices video games and other consumer electronic products  the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings    8    table of contents employees  at december 27 2015 we employed approximately 5000 persons worldwide approximately 2500 of whom were located in the united states  trademarks copyrights and patents  we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect  government regulation  our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the cpsa the federal hazardous substances act the fhsa the flammable fabrics act the ffa and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition a few of our products such as the food mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration  the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the cpsc to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product a banned hazardous substance under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an imminently hazardous consumer product under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned  consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many international markets including canada australia and europe we utilize independent third party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our product could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall could damage our reputation and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well  the childrens television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission as well as the laws of certain other countries also place limitations on television commercials during childrens programming and on advertising in other forms to children and on the collection of information from children such as restrictions on collecting information from children under the age of
