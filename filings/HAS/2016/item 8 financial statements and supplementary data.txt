in the companys consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests is presented in the consolidated balance sheets as temporary equity between liabilities and shareholders equity earnings losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest    62    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial

earnings specifically attributable to hasbro  presently the company has one investment with a redeemable noncontrolling interest which is the companys 70 majority interest in backflip studios llc backflip the company may be required to purchase the remaining 30 in the future contingent on the achievement by backflip of certain predetermined financial performance metrics the metrics because the company does not know the ultimate timing that these metrics may be met and thereby cannot currently estimate the purchase price of the remaining 30 the value reported reflects the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest on the date of acquisition which has been adjusted for cumulative earnings losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest since the date of acquisition as well as capital contributions made by or distributions made to the noncontrolling interest since the acquisition  property plant and equipment net  property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is computed using accelerated and straightline methods to depreciate the cost of property plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives the principal lives in years used in determining depreciation rates of various assets are land improvements 15 to 19 buildings and improvements 15 to 25 and machinery and equipment including computer hardware and software 3 to 12 depreciation expense is classified in the consolidated statements of operations based on the nature of the property and equipment being depreciated tools dies and molds are depreciated over a threeyear period or their useful lives whichever is less using an accelerated method the company generally owns all tools dies and molds related to its products  property plant and equipment net is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value wherein the fair value is the appraised value furthermore assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of the net book value or their estimated fair value less disposal costs  goodwill and other intangibles net  goodwill results from acquisitions the company has made over time substantially all of the other intangibles consist of the cost of acquired product rights in establishing the value of such rights the company considers existing trademarks copyrights patents license agreements and other productrelated rights these rights were valued on their acquisition date based on the anticipated future cash flows from the underlying product line the company has certain intangible assets related to the tonka and milton bradley acquisitions that have an indefinite life  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units this quantitative twostep process begins with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists when performing the quantitative twostep impairment test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value also calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows    63    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data    the company may bypass the quantitative twostep impairment process and perform a qualitative assessment if it is not more likely than not that impairment exists performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill requires a high degree of judgment regarding assumptions underlying the valuation qualitative factors and their impact on critical inputs are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  during the fourth quarter of 2015 the company performed a qualitative assessment with respect to goodwill associated with all but one of its reporting units and determined that it was not necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for the goodwill of these reporting units the company also performed quantitative twostep annual impairment tests related to its intangible assets with indefinite lives as well as goodwill associated with backflip the companys majority owned mobile gaming reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2015 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were in excess of the carrying value of the related intangible assets or reporting units as applicable  the remaining intangibles having defined lives are being amortized over periods ranging from four to twenty years primarily using the straightline method at december 27 2015 approximately 7 of other intangibles net are being amortized in proportion to actual and projected revenues  the company reviews other intangibles with defined lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value wherein that fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  financial instruments  hasbros financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable shortterm borrowings accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities at december 27 2015 the carrying cost of these instruments approximated their fair value the companys financial instruments at december 27 2015 also include longterm borrowings see note 9 for carrying cost and related fair values as well as certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value see notes 9 12 and 16  in april 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 interest  imputation of interest asc 83530 which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs asu 201503 requires debt issuance costs related to longterm debt to be presented in the balance sheet as a reduction to the carrying amount of the related debt liability consistent with the presentation of discounts asu 201503 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 and for interim periods within those fiscal years and is eligible for early adoption the company elected early adoption and deferred debt costs are presented as a reduction of longterm debt debt issuance costs of 14042 have been reclassified in the consolidated balance sheet for december 28 2014 to reflect this change in accounting principle  revenue recognition  revenue from product sales is recognized upon the passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment provisions for discounts rebates and returns are made when the related revenues are recognized the company bases its estimates for discounts rebates and returns on agreed customer terms and historical experience  the company enters into arrangements licensing its brands on specifically approved products or formats the licensees pay the company royalties based on their revenues derived from the brands in some cases subject    64    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data     to minimum guaranteed amounts royalty revenues are recognized as they are reported as earned and payment becomes assured over the life of the license agreement  the company produces television programming for license to third parties revenues from the distribution of television and other programming are recorded when the use of the content may be directed by the distributor and

inventoryrelated costs such as obsolescence  royalties  the company enters into license agreements with strategic partners inventors designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in its products these agreements may call for payment in advance or future payment of minimum guaranteed amounts amounts paid in advance are recorded as an asset and charged to expense when the related revenue is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations if all or a portion of the minimum guaranteed amounts appear not to be recoverable through future use of the rights obtained under the license the nonrecoverable portion of the guaranty is charged to expense at that time  advertising  production costs of commercials are expensed in the fiscal year during which the production is first aired the costs of other advertising and promotion programs are expensed in the fiscal year incurred  program production costs  the company incurs costs in connection with the production of television programming and motion pictures these costs are capitalized by the company as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of such period related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that impairment may exist the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on managements future revenue and cost estimates  shipping and handling  hasbro expenses costs related to the shipment and handling of goods to customers as incurred for 2015 2014 and 2013 these costs were 159854 157326 and 155316 respectively and are included in selling distribution and administration expenses  operating leases  hasbro records lease expense on a straightline basis inclusive of rent concessions and increases reimbursements from lessors for leasehold improvements are deferred and recognized as a reduction to lease expense over the remaining lease term    65    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data    income taxes  hasbro uses the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes deferred taxes are measured using rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will be unrealized deferred income taxes have not been provided on the majority of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as the majority of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company  the company uses a twostep process for the measurement of uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is a determination of whether the tax position should be recognized in the consolidated financial statements the second step determines the measurement of the tax position the company records potential interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense  in november 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201517 income taxes asc 740 which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by removing the requirement to bifurcate deferred income tax assets and liabilities between current and noncurrent while asu 201517 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 it is eligible for early adoption the company elected early adoption and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets this adoption was applied retrospectively and 75595 has been reclassified from prepaid expenses and other current assets to other assets and 3250 has been reclassified from accrued liabilities to other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 28 2014  foreign currency translation  foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at periodend exchange rates and revenues costs and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates during each reporting period net earnings include gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions and when required translation gains and losses resulting from the use of the us dollar as the functional currency in highly inflationary economies other gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements are a component of other comprehensive earnings loss  pension plans postretirement and postemployment benefits  pension expense and related amounts in the consolidated balance sheets are based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods the companys policy is to fund amounts which are required by applicable regulations and which are tax deductible in 2016 the company expects to contribute approximately 3600 to its pension plans the estimated amounts of future payments to be made under other retirement programs are being accrued currently over the period of active employment and are also included in pension expense hasbro has a contributory postretirement health and life insurance plan covering substantially all employees who retire under any of its united states defined benefit pension plans and meet certain age and length of service requirements the cost of providing these benefits on behalf of employees who retired prior to 1993 is and will continue to be substantially borne by the company the cost of providing benefits on behalf of substantially all employees who retire after 1992 is borne by the employee it also has several plans covering certain groups of employees which may    66    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data     provide benefits to such employees following their period of employment but prior to their retirement the company measures the costs of these obligations based on actuarial computations  stockbased compensation  the company has a stockbased employee compensation plan for employees and nonemployee members of the companys board of directors under this plan the company may grant stock options at or above the fair market value of the companys stock as well as restricted stock restricted stock units and contingent stock performance awards all awards are measured at fair value at the date of the grant and amortized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award for awards contingent upon company performance the measurement of the expense for these awards is based on the companys current estimate of its performance over the performance period for awards contingent upon the achievement of market conditions the probability of satisfying the market condition is considered in the estimation of the grant date fair value see note 13 for further discussion  risk management contracts  hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and projected future foreign currency transactions these overthecounter contracts which hedge future purchases of inventory and other crossborder currency requirements not denominated in the functional currency of the business unit are primarily denominated in united states and hong kong dollars as well as euros all contracts are entered into with a number of counterparties all of which are major financial institutions the company believes that a default by a counterparty would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company hasbro does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes  at the inception of the contracts hasbro designates its derivatives as either cash flow or fair value hedges the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions all hedges designated as cash flow hedges are linked to forecasted transactions and the company assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis the effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction the ineffective portion of a hedging derivative if any is immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of operations  the company records all derivatives such as foreign currency exchange contracts on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges and are effective are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss earnings aoce until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations the companys foreign currency contracts hedging anticipated cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges when it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively any gain or loss deferred through that date remains in aoce until the forecasted transaction occurs at which time it is reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations to the extent the transaction is no longer deemed probable of occurring hedge accounting treatment is discontinued and amounts deferred would be reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations in the event hedge accounting requirements are not met gains and losses on such instruments are included currently in the consolidated statements of operations the company uses derivatives to economically hedge intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies the company does not use hedge accounting for these contracts as changes in the fair value of these contracts are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the intercompany loans  prior to the issuance of the notes due 2021 and notes due 2044 the company entered into a forwardstarting interest rate swap contract to hedge the anticipated us treasury interest rates on the anticipated debt    67    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data     issuance these instruments which were designated and effective as hedges were terminated on the date of the related debt issuance and the then fair value of these instruments was recorded to aoce and is being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method over the life of the related debt  net earnings per common share  basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year as well as awards that have not been issued but all contingencies have been met diluted net earnings per share is similar except that the weighted average number of shares outstanding is increased by dilutive securities and net earnings are adjusted if necessary for certain amounts related to dilutive securities dilutive securities include shares issuable upon exercise of stock options for which the market price exceeds the exercise price less shares which could have been purchased by the company with the related proceeds dilutive securities also include shares issuable under restricted stock unit award agreements there were no antidilutive stock options or restricted stock unit awards to exclude from the diluted earnings per share calculation in 2015 options and restricted stock unit awards totaling 674 and 760 for 2014 and 2013 respectively were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because to include them would have been antidilutive  a reconciliation of net earnings and average number of shares for each of the three fiscal years ended december 27 2015 is as follows
