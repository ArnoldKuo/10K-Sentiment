architecture  hasbro organizes its owned controlled and licensed intellectual properties within the brand architecture with a focus on the following categories franchise brands partner brands hasbro gaming and emerging brands implementation of the brand architecture has allowed us to leverage existing brand competencies outside the confines of our traditional product categories creating significant growth opportunities in our brands  franchise brands are hasbros most significant owned or controlled properties which we believe have the ability to deliver significant revenues and growth over the longterm our seven franchise brands are littlest pet shop magic the gathering monopoly my little pony nerf playdoh and transformers as reported net revenues from franchise brands grew 2 in 2016 compared to a decline of 2 in 2015 and growth of 31 in 2014 in 2016 2015 and 2014 franchise brands were 46 52 and 55 of total net revenues respectively    1    table of contents partner

importance of digital content in gaming media and integrating our products digital media encompasses digital gaming applications and the creation of digital environments for analog products through the use of complementary digital applications and websites which    2    table of contents  extend storylines and enhance play as of december 2016 we owned a 70 majority stake in backflip studios llc backflip a mobile game developer and in january 2017 we increased our ownership to 100 while certain of our trademarks characters and other property rights are licensed by third parties in connection with digital gaming we anticipate increasingly leveraging and applying backflips digital gaming expertise to hasbro brands in 2017 and beyond  as we seek to grow our business in entertainment licensing and digital gaming we will continue to evaluate strategic alliances acquisitions and investments like hasbro studios boulder media the network and backflip which may allow us to build out our competencies around the brand blueprint such as in storytelling and digital complement our current product offerings allow us entry into an area which is adjacent or complementary to our toy and game business allow us to add to our brand portfolio or allow us to further develop awareness of our brands and expand the ability of consumers to experience our brands in different forms and formats  product categories  through 2016 we marketed our brands under the following primary product categories 1 boys 2 games 3 girls and 4 preschool toys beginning in 2017 we will be organizing categories around our brand architecture as described above  boys franchise brands in our boys category include the nerf action sports products and transformers action figures and accessories the transformers brand which has been supported by the four major successful theatrical releases over the past decade in combination with animated television program developed by hasbro studios transformers robots in disguise has become a hallmark example of how successful our brand blueprint can be when properly executed across all mediums in addition to these franchise brands the boys category also includes super soaker water blasters and action figures and accessories another significant portion of our boys category includes licensed product lines based on popular movie television and comic book characters such as marvel and star wars in addition to marketing and developing traditional action figures and accessories for these entertainment brands the company also develops and markets products

friends game of life jenga operation scrabble trivial pursuit twister the 2015 introduction of pie face and the 2016 introduction of speak out to successfully execute our gaming strategy we consider

certain product lines based on popular television and film brands including disneys descendants disney princess disney frozen and dreamworks trolls our disney princess and disney frozen product lines were introduced at retail in january 2016 lastly hasbro continues to grow and promote existing brands by leveraging their strengths across other toy categories our nerf rebelle and playdoh doh vinci product lines reflect this strategy  preschool our preschool category encompasses a range of products for infants and preschoolers in various stages of development in the preschool category we are focused on our franchise brands and storyled initiatives where we believe we can differentiate our offerings and deliver higher profitability franchise brand offerings in the preschool category include my little pony transformers and playdoh including modeling compound and playsets our offerings also include preschool product lines based on those aforementioned licensed entertainment properties including marvel and star wars in recent years we have introduced preschool product lines which complement our girls and boys product lines generally these product lines fall within our playskool hereos and playskool friends brands and include my little pony transformers rescue bots marvel super hero adventures and star wars galactic heroes in addition to playskool heroes and playskool friends our playskool brand also includes wellknown core products    3    table of contents  such as mr potato head sit n spin and gloworm along with a line of infant toys including step start walk n ride and elefun busy ball popper  given the evolution of our business with a focus on brands rather than individual products within a brand as well as the development of our brands and our partners brands across the brand blueprint into products and entertainment that are enjoyed by girls and boys beginning in 2017 we will report our revenues by brand portfolio franchise brands partner brands hasbro gaming and emerging brands as those portfolios were described at the beginning of this section at that time we will cease providing a revenue breakdown by the historical categories boys games girls and preschool  segments  organizationally our three principal segments are us and canada international and entertainment and licensing the us and canada and international segments engage in the marketing and selling of various toy and game products described above our toy and game products are primarily developed by crossfunctional teams including members of our global development and marketing groups to establish a cohesive brand direction and assist the segments in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of these groups are allocated to the principal segments our us and canada segment covers the united states and canada while the international segment primarily includes europe the asia pacific region and latin and south america the entertainment and licensing segment conducts our movie television and digital gaming entertainment operations including the operations of hasbro studios and backflip as well as engages in the outlicensing of our trademarks characters and other brand and intellectual property rights to third parties for noncompeting products our global operations segment is responsible for arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the us and canada and international segments financial information with respect to our segments and geographic areas is included in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k the following is a discussion of each segment  us and canada this segment engages in the marketing and sale of our products in the united states and canada the us and canada segment promotes our brands through innovation and reinvention of toys and games this is accomplished through introducing new products and initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and licenses this strategy leverages efforts to increase consumer awareness of the companys brands through entertainment experiences including motion pictures and television programming  international the international segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most countries in europe latin and south america and the asia pacific region and through distributors in those countries where we have no direct presence we have offices in more than 35 countries contributing to sales in more than 120 countries  in addition to growing brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses we seek to grow our international business by continuing to opportunistically expand into emerging markets in eastern europe asia and latin and south america emerging markets are an area of high priority for us as we believe they offer greater opportunities for revenue growth than developed markets key emerging markets include russia brazil and the peoples republic of china china and during 2016 we opened an office in argentina while in 2015 we opened offices in south africa and thailand net revenues from emerging markets represented 14 of our total consolidated net revenues in 2016 in 2016 net revenues from emerging markets increased 9 2015 net revenues in emerging markets declined 9 primarily due to the foreign currency environment while in 2014 emerging market net revenues grew 20 the strengthening of the us dollar had a negative impact on the international segment during 2016 although not as impactful as that seen in 2015 the negative impact from foreign currency translation on international segment net revenues for 2016 2015 and 2014 was 584 million 3794 million and 877 million respectively financial information with respect to foreign currency risk management is included in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k  entertainment and licensing our entertainment and licensing segment includes our consumer products licensing digital gaming television and movie entertainment operations  our consumer products licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings such as apparel publishing home goods and electronics or in certain situations to utilize them for toy products where we consider the outlicensing of brands to be more effective  our digital gaming business seeks to promote our brands largely through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games for play on mobile devices personal    4    table of contents  computers and video game consoles based on those brands through backflip our mobile game developer we seek to complement the aforementioned outlicensing with the development of internal digital gaming resources backflips product offerings include games for tablets and mobile devices including dragonvale and dragonvale world games through backflip we intend to continue focusing on our existing game titles and to launch new games including further offerings based on hasbro brands for example in 2016 backflip released transformers earth wars to further extend our brands into digital media and gaming the company also outlicenses its properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games and other gaming experiences based on those brands the company has digital gaming relationships with electronic arts inc activision ubisoft scopely and others lastly we also license our brands to third parties engaged in other forms of gaming including scientific games corporation  major motion pictures and television programming based on our owned and controlled brands provide both immersive storytelling and the ability for our consumers to experience these properties in a different format which we believe can result in increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related home entertainment releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from toy and game product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment and licensing segment  global operations our global operations segment sources production of our toy and game products through august 2015 the company owned and operated manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland which predominantly produced game products these facilities were sold to cartamundi nv cartamundi on august 31 2015 cartamundi continues to manufacture significant quantities of game products for us in their two facilities under a multiyear manufacturing agreement sourcing for our other production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see manufacturing and importing below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing  other information to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer is geographically located  certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence  each of our four product categories namely boys games girls and preschool generate greater than 10 of our net revenues for more information including the amount of net revenues attributable to each of our four product categories see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k  working capital requirements  our working capital needs are financed through cash generated from operations primarily through the sale of toys and games and secondarily through our consumer products licensing and entertainment operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings  our customer order patterns may vary from year to year largely due to fluctuations in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions as such a disproportionate volume of our net revenues are earned during the third and fourth quarters leading up to the retail industrys holiday selling season including christmas as a result comparisons of unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in the prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response or justintime inventory management practices result in a significant proportion of orders being placed for immediate delivery although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are indicative of future sales we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy as such our business generally earns more revenue in the second half of the year compared to the first half in 2016 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 66 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters each accounting for 33 of full year net revenues the types of programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2017 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2016 and in prior years    5    table of contents historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2016 we utilized cash from our operations borrowings under our commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements  product development and royalties  our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our play and entertainment offerings and requires continued development of new brands and products alongside the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy and game products are developed by a global development function the costs of which are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in 2016 2015 and 2014 we incurred expenses of 2664 million 2429 million and 2226 million respectively on activities related to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers  in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees  we also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements in 2016 2015 and 2014 we incurred 4095 million 3792 million and 3053 million respectively of royalty expense our royalty expense in any given year may also vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media  marketing and sales  while our global development function focuses on brand and product innovation and reinvention our global marketing function establishes brand direction and messaging and assists the selling entities in establishing local marketing programs the global marketing group works crossfunctionally with the global development function to deliver unified brandspecific points of view the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in addition to the global marketing function our local selling entities employ sales and marketing functions responsible for local market activities and execution  our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores drug stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased etailers our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products with remaining sales generated by independent distributors who for the most part sell our products in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence notwithstanding our thousands of customers the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers customer concentration provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution practices and other reductions in costs of sales and distribution however customer concentration can also create additional risks for our business these risks can create potential detriments to our business resulting from the financial difficulties of our major customers which could lead to reductions in sales or unfavorable changes in our business relationships with one or more of our major customers customer concentration may also decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2016 net revenues from our top five customers accounted for approximately 41 of our consolidated global net revenues including our three largest customers walmart stores inc toys r us inc and target corporation who represented 18 9 and 9 respectively of consolidated global net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 62 of our net revenues were derived from these top three customers    6    table of contents we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television and through digital marketing and advertising of our brands products are strategically crosspromoted by spotlighting specific products alongside related offerings in a manner that promotes the sale of not only the selected item but also those complementary products in addition to those advertising initiatives hasbro studios produces entertainment based primarily on our brands which appears on discovery family channel and other major networks globally as well as on various other digital platforms such as netflix and itunes we also introduce many of our new products to major customers within one to two years leading up to their year of retail introduction we generally showcase certain new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows including in hong kong and nuremburg germany in 2016 2015 and 2014 we incurred 4689 million 4094 million and 4203 million respectively in expense related to advertising and promotional programs  manufacturing and importing  during 2016 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in two previously owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland these facilities were owned by the company through august 2015 at which point they were sold to cartamundi who continues to manufacture significant quantities of game products for us under a multiyear manufacturing agreement  we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2017 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured and production shifted to those new sources the imposition of trade sanctions tariffs border adjustment taxes or other measures by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of normal trade relations status with china or other countries where we manufacture products or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china or other countries where we manufacture products such as higher labor costs or an appreciation in the chinese yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured and imported into other markets  most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year  the manufacturing processes of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly the countries of the far east particularly china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us  competition  we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of toys and games and other family entertainment offerings but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with other companies that offer branded entertainment specific to children and their families competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing in entertainment hasbro studios and discovery family channel compete with other childrens and family television networks and entertainment producers such as nickelodeon cartoon network and disney channel for viewers advertising revenue and distribution    7    table of contents in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and play entertainment companies we contend with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age the variety of product and entertainment offerings available for children has expanded and product life cycles have shortened as children move on to more sophisticated offerings at younger ages this has been referred to as children getting older younger but may also be referred to as developmental compression as a result our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers and companies offering branded family play and entertainment we also compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with entertainment offerings of many technology companies such as makers of tablets mobile devices video games and other consumer electronic products  the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings  employees  at december 25 2016 we employed approximately 5400 persons worldwide approximately 2600 of whom were located in the united states  trademarks copyrights and patents  we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect  government regulation  our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the cpsa the federal hazardous substances act the fhsa the flammable fabrics act the ffa and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition a few of our products such as the food mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration  the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the cpsc to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product a banned hazardous substance under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an imminently hazardous consumer product under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned  consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many international markets including canada australia and europe we utilize independent third party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our product could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall could damage our reputation and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well  the childrens television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission as well as the laws of certain other countries also place limitations on television commercials during childrens programming and on advertising in other forms to children and on the collection of information from children such as restrictions on collecting information from children under the age of thirteen subject to the provisions of the childrens online privacy protection act  we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state
