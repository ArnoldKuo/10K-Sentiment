of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this asu is now effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 and for interim periods within those fiscal years and may be adopted early but not before december 15 2016 the company expects to adopt this standard in fiscal 2018 and has not yet determined which transition method will be utilized while the company is still in the process of completing its evaluation of its various revenue streams and processes relating to the requirements of asu 201409 based on the analysis performed to date the company does not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on the companys results or financial statements certain contracts within the entertainment amp licensing segment may be impacted as well as certain isolated transactions within the us amp canada and international segments but this impact is not expected to be material to the financial statements of the company  in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases topic 842 asu 201602 which will require lessees to recognize a rightofuse asset and a lease liability for virtually all of their leases the liability will be based on the present value of lease payments and the asset will be based on the liability for income statement purposes a dual model was retained requiring leases to be either classified as operating or finance operating leases will result in straightline expense while finance leases will result in a frontloaded expense pattern additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures will be required asu 201602 is required for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 and must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition the company is evaluating the requirements of asu 201602 and its potential impact on the companys financial statements the company has a

either to estimate forfeitures as required today or recognize forfeitures as they occur asu 201609 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within that reporting period the company will adopt asu 201609 in the    38    table of contents  first quarter of 2017 under the new standard the company will elect to recognize forfeitures as they occur based upon the companys history of forfeitures it is not expected that this election will have a material impact on its financial statements however as any impact will be based on future forfeitures the actual impact could differ from the companys expectation the impact of the other aspects of asu 201609 are based on the companys future stock price at the date of vesting or exercise of sharebased payments as well as the timing of exercises and as such the company cannot estimate the impact of these aspects other than to expect that the adoption of this standard will benefit our future tax expense in the short term the extent to which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time nor can we estimate whether such benefits will continue or will result in increased tax expense in the longer term  in july 2015 the fasb issued asu 201511 simplifying the measurement of inventory asu 201511 which replaces the concept of market price with the single

goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment the standard eliminates the requirement to measure the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a

loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess limited by the amount of goodwill in that reporting unit for public companies this standard is effective and must be applied to annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the standard but expect that it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  liquidity and capital resources  the company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations in 2016 the company funded its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations and when needed using borrowings under its available lines of credit and its commercial paper program during 2017 the company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations and when needed by issuing commercial paper or borrowing under its revolving credit agreement in the event that the company is not able to issue commercial paper the company intends to utilize its available lines of credit the company believes that the funds available to it including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or its available lines of credit are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2017 however unexpected events or circumstances such as material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures or inability to otherwise access the commercial paper market may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources in addition significant disruptions to credit markets may also reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources although the company believes the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to its financial facilities is not significant in times of severe economic downturn in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to the company    39    table of contents as of december 25 2016 the companys cash and cash equivalents totaled 12823 million substantially all

contracts and other receivables were partially offset by decreases in royalty advances and a payment reducing amounts due from cartamundi related to the sale of the companys manufacturing operations in 2015 other assets increased approximately 3 in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase primarily reflects longterm amounts due from cartamundi related to the sale of the companys manufacturing operations as well as higher longterm receivables related to multiyear television distribution agreements these increases were partially offset by lower longterm royalty advances  accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased 22 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased accounts payable due to timing of payments higher accrued royalties for licensed properties reflecting 2016s stronger entertainment lineup and utilization of guarantee payments compared to 2015 as well as higher accrued income taxes due to higher fourth quarter earnings higher accrued advertising due to lower levels of advertising in the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased foreign exchange currency liability related to certain strengthening foreign currencies in 2016 accounts payable and accrued

in 2016 including 400 million contingent on theatrical movie releases  critical accounting policies and significant estimates  the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available these estimates and assumptions    42    table of contents  affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the companys reported financial results include sales allowances program production costs recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments pension costs and obligations and income taxes  sales allowances  sales allowances for customer promotions discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment revenue from product sales less related sales allowances along with license fees and royalty revenue comprise net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts certain of the allowances such as the returns allowance are based on market data historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation  for its allowance programs that are not fixed such as returns the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues during 2016 there were no material adjustments to the companys estimates made in prior years  program production costs  the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs and films based primarily on the companys toy and game brands these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that impairment may exist the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on managements future revenue and cost estimates  the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individualfilmforecast method ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the film or television program and include toy game and other consumer product licensing fees first run program distribution fees and other revenue sources such as dvd and digital distribution our ultimate revenue estimates for each film or television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information when estimates for a film or television program are revised the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our films and television programs in the us which are primarily distributed on discovery family channel globally to other broadcasters and available on netflix and itunes and success of our programrelated toy game and other merchandise  for the year ended december 25 2016 we have 828 million of program production and film costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets we currently expect that a significant portion of capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3year period 2017 through 2019 future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and managements then current estimates of ultimate revenues during 2016 and 2014 the company recorded accelerated amortization on certain television programming based on revised ultimate expected revenues  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the    43    table of contents  company will perform an interim test at that time the company may perform a qualitative assessment and bypass the quantitative twostep impairment process if it is not more likely than not that impairment exists  performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill requires a high degree of judgment regarding assumptions underlying the valuation qualitative factors and their impact on critical inputs are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if it is more likely than not that impairment exists the quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test is performed when performing the quantitative twostep impairment test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is calculated using an income approach during the fourth quarter of 2016 the company performed a qualitative assessment with respect to certain of its reporting units with goodwill totaling 4736 million the company utilized this approach for all reporting units with the exception of backflip based on the amount by which historical estimated reporting unit fair values exceeded carrying values based on its qualitative assessment the company concluded that there was no impairment of this goodwill excluding backflip during 2016  as of december 27 2015 the company had 1191 million of goodwill related to its 2013 acquisition of backflip which represents a separate reporting unit the companys strategy when it purchased its interest in backflip was to produce game titles based on backflips dragonvale brand and to develop and market games based on hasbro brands because backflip was a recent acquisition and to date had been investment spending in anticipation of 2016 game releases the company performed the quantitative twostep impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2015 for this reporting unit at that time the company concluded that there was no goodwill impairment related to backflip during the fourth quarter of 2016 in conjunction with the companys annual review for impairment we completed step one of the annual goodwill impairment test for the backflip reporting unit prior to the fourth quarter of 2016 there were no triggering events that would have required the company to complete an impairment test our evaluation of the current year performance of the backflip reporting unit was dependent in large part on the performance of launches that took place during the fourth quarter additionally during the fourth quarter we revised our expectations regarding the timing of future launches the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis involved comparing the backflip carrying value to its estimated fair value which was calculated based on the income approach discounted cash flows serve as the primary basis for the income approach the company utilized forecasted cash flows for the backflip reporting unit that included assumptions including but not limited to expected revenues to be realized based on planned future mobile game releases expected ebitda margins derived in part based on expected future royalty costs advertising and marketing costs development costs and overhead costs and expected future tax rates the cash flows beyond the forecast period were estimated using a terminal value growth rate of 3 to calculate the fair value of the future cash flows under the income approach a discount rate of 14 was utilized representing the reporting units estimated weightedaverage cost of capital based on the results of the step one impairment test the company determined that the fair value of the backflip reporting unit was below its carrying value and therefore impairment was indicated because indicators of impairment existed the company commenced the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis to determine the implied fair value of goodwill for the backflip reporting unit which was determined in the same manner utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination as part of the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis the company assigned the fair value of the backflip reporting unit as calculated under the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis to all the assets and liabilities including identifiable intangibles assets of that reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the excess of the fair value of the backflip reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities based on this assessment the company recorded an impairment charge of 329 million should backflip not achieve its profitability and growth targets including the anticipated game releases in 2017 and beyond or if industry discount rates significantly increase the carrying value of this reporting unit may become further impaired at december 25 2016 there is 863 million of remaining goodwill related to the backflip reporting unit  during the third quarter of 2016 the company acquired boulder media an animation studio based in dublin ireland based on the companys analysis goodwill in the amount of 118 million was recorded and is reflected in the entertainment and licensing segment due to the timing of the acquisition in conjunction with the companys annual impairment review it was concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in 2016 related to boulder media  the company also performed quantitative annual impairment tests related to intangible assets totaling 757 million with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of 2016 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values of the related assets  the estimation of future cash flows utilized in the evaluation of the companys goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective    44    table of contents  asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge  intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective assets and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 1702 million at december 25 2016 during 2016 there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets  recoverability of royalty advances and commitments  the companys ability to earnout royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the nonrecoverable minimum guaranty is required if advanced or if not advanced an expense is recorded to accrue the shortfall the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 25 2016 the company had 1028 million of prepaid royalties 341 million of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 687 million of which are included in other assets pension costs and obligations  pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the us with no future benefits accruing to employees during 2015 the company froze benefits under its other funded us pension plan the company will continue to pay benefits under the plans consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze  the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the companys estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2016 pension expense for the us plans was 675 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2016 pension expense for us plans by approximately 07 million  discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the companys weighted average discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2016 pension expense was 458 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the companys discount rate would have increased 2016 pension expense by approximately 10 million  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods at december 25 2016 the companys us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of 1409 million included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to 1205 million at december 27 2015    45    table of contents  the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december 25 2016 decreased to 422 from 458 used at december 27 2015 a decrease of 025 in the companys discount rate would have increased the 2016 projected benefit obligation by approximately 118 million pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains  income taxes  the companys annual income tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the companys annual tax rate and evaluate its tax positions despite the companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges these estimated liabilities as well as the related interest are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit  an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the companys interim results in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the companys interim results the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time in addition changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs during 2016 2015 and 2014 the company recorded net benefits of approximately 120 million 40 million and 200 million respectively associated with discrete tax events excluding any potential interest and penalties  in certain cases tax law requires items to be included in the companys income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the consolidated financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the consolidated financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on the companys tax returns while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time such as depreciation expense these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the companys income tax returns valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income including capital gains to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the companys income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the companys consolidated financial statements or income recognized in the consolidated financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the companys income tax return deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as most of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company in the event the company determines that such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax rates of the international subsidiaries at december 25 2016 the difference between the tax in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries on cumulative undistributed earnings was approximately

hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate 976 million decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions  the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the companys revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from

union eu commonly referred to as brexit the uk government has stated it will begin the formal twoyear period to negotiate the terms of the uks exit and future relationship with the eu by april 2017 the terms of this future relationship are uncertain but the uk government has confirmed its intention to remove the uk from the eu single market and implement additional controls on the movement of people from the eu the brexit vote resulted in a weakening of british pound sterling against the us dollar and increased volatility in the foreign currency markets notably the euro these fluctuations have adversely affected our financial results for 2016 although the impact has been partially mitigated by our hedging strategy our revenues in europe are predominantly denominated in local currency hasbro will continue to closely monitor the brexit negotiations and the foreign currency markets taking appropriate actions to support its long term strategy and to mitigate risks in its operational and financial activities  the economy and inflation  the principal market for the companys products is the retail sector revenues from the companys top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 41 of its consolidated net revenues in 2016 and 38 and 39 of its consolidated net revenues in 2015 and 2014 respectively the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate      48    table of contents the companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2016 approximately 66 of the companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas  quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in orders increasingly placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the companys future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the companys significant retailers could negatively impact the companys future revenues  the effect of inflation on the companys operations during 2016 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly  other information  the company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position
