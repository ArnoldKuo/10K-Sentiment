summary of significant accounting policies  preparation of consolidated financial statements  the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto actual results could differ from those estimates  principles of consolidation  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hasbro inc and all majorityowned subsidiaries hasbro or the company investments representing 20 to 50 ownership interests in other companies are accounted for using the equity method for those majorityowned subsidiaries that are not 100 owned by hasbro the interests of the minority owners are accounted for as noncontrolling interests   all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated  fiscal year  hasbros fiscal year ends on the last

balances and highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity to the company of three months or less  marketable securities  included in marketable securities are investments in private investment funds these investments are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and due to the nature and business purpose of these investments the company has selected the fair value option which requires the company to record the unrealized gains and losses on these investments in the consolidated statements of operations at the time they occur marketable securities also include common stock in a public company arising from a business relationship this investment is also included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets however due to its nature and business purpose the company records unrealized gains and losses on this investment in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets until it is sold at which point the realized gains or losses will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  credit is granted to customers predominantly on an unsecured basis credit limits and payment terms are established based on extensive evaluations made on an ongoing basis throughout the fiscal year with regard to the financial performance cash generation financing availability and liquidity status of each customer the majority of customers are formally reviewed at least annually more frequent reviews are performed based on the customers financial condition and the level of credit being extended for customers on credit who are experiencing financial difficulties management performs additional financial analyses before shipping orders the company uses a variety of financial transactions based on availability and cost to increase the collectability of certain of its accounts including letters of credit credit insurance and requiring cash in advance of shipping  the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on managements assessment of the business environment customers financial condition historical collection experience accounts receivable aging and customer disputes when a significant event occurs such as a bankruptcy filing by a specific customer and on a quarterly basis the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and the balance is adjusted to reflect current risk assessments    56    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes

investment additional cash investments loan repayments or other cash paid to the investee are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows  the company reviews its equity method investments for impairment on a periodic basis if it has been determined that the fair value of the equity investment is less than its related carrying value and that this decline is otherthantemporary the carrying value of the investment is adjusted downward to reflect these declines in value the company has one significant equity method investment its 40 interest in a joint venture with discovery communications inc discovery  the company and discovery are party to an option agreement with respect to this joint venture the company has recorded a liability for this option agreement at fair value which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets unrealized gains and losses on this option are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as they occur  see notes 5 and 12 for additional information  redeemable noncontrolling interests  redeemable noncontrolling interests are those noncontrolling interests which are or may become redeemable at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date at the option of the holder or upon occurrence of an event the financial results and position of the redeemable noncontrolling interest are included in their entirety in the companys consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests is presented in the consolidated balance sheets as temporary equity between liabilities and shareholders equity earnings losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest are presented as a separate line on the consolidated statements of operations which is necessary to identify those earnings specifically attributable to hasbro  through 2016 the company had one investment with a redeemable noncontrolling interest which was the companys 70 majority interest in backflip studios llc backflip under the terms of our agreement with backflip the company may have been required to acquire the remaining 30 in the future contingent on the achievement by backflip of certain predetermined financial performance metrics the metrics because the company did not know the ultimate timing that these metrics would be met and thereby could not estimate the purchase price of the remaining 30 the value reported reflects the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest on the date of acquisition which has been adjusted for cumulative earnings losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest since the date of acquisition as well as capital contributions made by or distributions made to the noncontrolling interest since the acquisition during the first quarter of 2017 the remaining 30 of backflip studios was acquired by hasbro for no additional consideration making it a whollyowned subsidiary of the company  property plant and equipment net  property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is computed using accelerated and straightline methods to depreciate the cost of property plant and equipment over their    57    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data    estimated useful lives the principal lives in years used in determining depreciation rates of various assets are land improvements 15 to 19 buildings and improvements 15 to 25 and machinery and equipment including computer hardware and software 3 to 12 depreciation expense is classified in the consolidated statements of operations based on the nature of the property and equipment being depreciated tools dies and molds are depreciated over a threeyear period or their useful lives whichever is less using an accelerated method the company generally owns all tools dies and molds related to its products  property plant and equipment net is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value wherein the fair value is the appraised value furthermore assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of the net book value or their estimated fair value less disposal costs  goodwill and other intangibles net  goodwill results from acquisitions the company has made over time substantially all of the other intangibles consist of the cost of acquired product rights in establishing the value of such rights the company considers existing trademarks copyrights patents license agreements and other productrelated rights these rights were valued on their acquisition date based on the anticipated future cash flows from the underlying product line the company has certain intangible assets related to the tonka and milton bradley acquisitions that have an indefinite life  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units this quantitative twostep process begins with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists when performing the quantitative twostep impairment test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value also calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows  the company may bypass the quantitative twostep impairment process and perform a qualitative assessment if it is not more likely than not that impairment exists performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill requires a high degree of judgment regarding assumptions underlying the valuation qualitative factors and their impact on critical inputs are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  during the fourth quarter of 2016 the company performed a qualitative assessment with respect to goodwill associated with all but one of its reporting units and determined that it was not necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for the goodwill of these reporting units the company also performed quantitative twostep annual impairment tests related to its intangible assets with indefinite lives as well as goodwill associated with backflip the companys majority owned mobile gaming reporting unit as a result of the annual impairment test the company concluded the goodwill associated with the backflip reporting unit was impaired and recorded a noncash impairment charge of 32858 no other impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were in excess of the carrying value of the related intangible assets or reporting units as applicable see further discussion in note 4  the remaining intangibles having defined lives are being amortized over periods ranging from four to twenty years primarily using the straightline method  the company reviews other intangibles with defined lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value wherein that fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows    58    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data    financial instruments  hasbros financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable shortterm borrowings accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities at december 25 2016 the carrying cost of these instruments approximated their fair value the companys financial instruments at december 25 2016 also include longterm borrowings see note 9 for carrying cost and related fair values as well as certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value see notes 12 and 16  revenue recognition  revenue from product sales is recognized upon the passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment provisions for discounts rebates and returns are made when the related revenues are recognized the company bases its estimates for discounts rebates and returns on agreed customer terms and historical experience  the company enters into arrangements licensing its brands on specifically approved products or formats the licensees pay the company royalties based on their revenues derived from the brands in some cases subject to minimum guaranteed amounts royalty revenues are recognized as they are reported as earned and payment becomes assured over the life of the license agreement  the company produces television programming for license to third parties revenues from the distribution of television and other programming are recorded when the use of the content may be directed by the distributor and when certain other conditions are met  revenue from product sales less related provisions for discounts rebates and returns as well as royalty television programming and digital gaming revenues comprise net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations  costs of sales  cost of sales primarily consists of purchased materials labor tooling manufacturing overheads and other inventoryrelated costs such as obsolescence  royalties  the company enters into license agreements with strategic partners inventors designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in its products these agreements may call for payment in advance or future payment of minimum guaranteed amounts amounts paid in advance are recorded as an asset and charged to expense when the related revenue is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations if all or a portion of the minimum guaranteed amounts appear not to be recoverable through future use of the rights obtained under the license the nonrecoverable portion of the guaranty is charged to expense at that time  advertising  production costs of commercials are expensed in the fiscal year during which the production is first aired the costs of other advertising and promotion programs are expensed in the fiscal year incurred  program production costs  the company incurs costs in connection with the production of television programming and motion pictures these costs are capitalized by the company as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of such period related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that impairment may exist the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on managements future revenue and cost estimates    59    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data    shipping and handling  hasbro expenses costs related to the shipment and handling of goods to customers as incurred for 2016 2015 and 2014 these costs were 180270 159854 and 157326 respectively and are included in selling distribution and administration expenses  operating leases  hasbro records lease expense on a straightline basis inclusive of rent concessions and increases reimbursements from lessors for leasehold improvements are deferred and recognized as a reduction to lease expense over the remaining lease term  income taxes  hasbro uses the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes deferred taxes are measured using rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will be unrealized deferred income taxes have not been provided on the majority of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as the majority of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company  the company uses a twostep process for the measurement of uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is a determination of whether the tax position should be recognized in the consolidated financial statements the second step determines the measurement of the tax position the company records potential interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense  foreign currency translation  foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at periodend exchange rates and revenues costs and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates during each reporting period net earnings include gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions and when required translation gains and losses resulting from the use of the us dollar as the functional currency in highly inflationary economies other gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements are a component of other comprehensive earnings loss  pension plans postretirement and postemployment benefits  pension expense and related amounts in the consolidated balance sheets are based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods the corridor used for this purpose is equal to 10 of the greater of plan liabilities or market asset values and future periods vary by plan but generally equal the actuarially determined average expected future working lifetime of active plan participants the companys policy is to fund amounts which are required by applicable regulations and which are tax deductible the estimated amounts of future payments to be made under other retirement programs are being accrued currently over the period of active employment and are also included in pension expense hasbro has a contributory postretirement health and life insurance plan covering substantially all employees who retire under any of its united states defined benefit pension plans and meet certain age and length of service requirements the cost of providing these benefits on behalf of employees who retired prior to 1993 is and will continue to be substantially borne by the company the cost of providing benefits on behalf of substantially all employees who retire after 1992 is borne by the employee it also has several plans covering certain groups of employees which may provide benefits to such employees following their period of employment but prior to their retirement the company measures the costs of these obligations based on actuarial computations  stockbased compensation  the company has a stockbased employee compensation plan for employees and nonemployee members of the companys board of directors under this plan the company may grant stock options at or above the fair    60    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data    market value of the companys stock as well as restricted stock restricted stock units and contingent stock performance awards all awards are measured at fair value at the date of the grant and amortized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award for awards contingent upon company performance the measurement of the expense for these awards is based on the companys current estimate of its performance over the performance period for awards contingent upon the achievement of market conditions the probability of satisfying the market condition is considered in the estimation of the grant date fair value see note 13 for further discussion  in march 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201609 asu 201609 compensationstock compensation topic 718 which simplifies the accounting for income taxes related to stockbased compensation for public companies this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption is permitted under the new standard the company will elect to recognize forfeitures as they occur based upon the companys history of forfeitures it is not expected that this election will have a material impact on its financial statements however as any impact will be based on future forfeitures the actual impact could differ from the companys expectation the impact of the other aspects of asu 201609 are based on the companys future stock price at the date of vesting or exercise of sharebased payments as well as the timing of exercises and as such the company cannot estimate the impact of these aspects other than to expect that the adoption of this standard will benefit future tax expense in the short term the extent to which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time nor can we estimate whether such benefits will continue or will result in increased tax expense in the longer term  risk management contracts  hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and projected future foreign currency transactions these overthecounter contracts which hedge future purchases of inventory and other crossborder currency requirements not denominated in the functional currency of the business unit are primarily denominated in united states and hong kong dollars as well as euros all contracts are entered into with a number of counterparties all of which are major financial institutions the company believes that a default by a counterparty would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company hasbro does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes  at the inception of the contracts hasbro designates its derivatives as either cash flow or fair value hedges the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions all hedges designated as cash flow hedges are linked to forecasted transactions and the company assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis the effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction the ineffective portion of a hedging derivative if any is immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of operations  the company records all derivatives such as foreign currency exchange contracts on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges and are effective are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss aoce until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations the companys foreign currency contracts hedging anticipated cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges when it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively any gain or loss deferred through that date remains in aoce until the forecasted transaction occurs at which time it is reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations to the extent the transaction is no longer deemed probable of occurring hedge accounting treatment is discontinued and amounts deferred would be reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations in the event hedge accounting requirements are not met gains and losses on such instruments are included currently in the consolidated statements of operations the company uses derivatives to economically hedge intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies the company does not use hedge accounting for these contracts as changes in the fair value of these contracts are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the intercompany loans  prior to the issuance of the notes due 2021 and notes due 2044 the company entered into a forwardstarting interest rate swap contract to hedge the anticipated us treasury interest rates on the anticipated debt issuance these instruments which were designated and effective as hedges were terminated on the date of the related    61    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued  thousands of dollars and shares except per share data    debt issuance and the then fair value of these instruments was recorded to aoce and will be amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method over the life of the related debt  net earnings per common share  basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year as well as awards that have not been issued but all contingencies have been met diluted net earnings per share is similar except that the weighted average number of shares outstanding is increased by dilutive securities and net earnings are adjusted if necessary for certain amounts related to dilutive securities dilutive securities include shares issuable upon exercise of stock options for which the market price exceeds the exercise price less shares which could have been purchased by the company with the related proceeds dilutive securities also include shares issuable under restricted stock unit award agreements options and restricted stock unit awards totaling 277 and 674 for 2016 and 2014 respectively were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because to include them would have been antidilutive there were no antidilutive stock options or restricted stock unit awards to exclude from the diluted earnings per share

corporate segment of the business for purposes of the goodwill impairment testing these assets are allocated to the reporting units within the companys operating segments  the company performs an annual impairment test on goodwill this annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of the companys fiscal year in addition if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim impairment test at that time  during the fourth quarter of 2016 in conjunction with the companys annual review for impairment we completed step one of the annual goodwill impairment test for the backflip reporting unit prior to the fourth quarter of 2016 there were no triggering events that would have required the company to test for impairment the companys evaluation of the current year performance of the backflip reporting unit was dependent in large part on the performance of launches that took place during the fourth quarter additionally during the fourth quarter the company revised its expectations regarding the timing of future launches the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis involved comparing the backflip carrying value to its estimated fair value which was calculated based on the income approach discounted cash flows serve as the primary basis for the income approach the company utilized forecasted cash flows for the backflip reporting unit that included assumptions including but not    64    table of contents hasbro inc and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial

in part based on expected future royalty costs advertising and marketing costs development costs and overhead costs and expected future tax rates the cash flows beyond the forecast period were estimated using a terminal value growth rate of 3 to calculate the fair value of the future cash flows under the income approach a discount rate of 14 was utilized representing the reporting units estimated weightedaverage cost of capital based on the results of the step one impairment test the company determined that the fair value of the backflip reporting unit was below its carrying value and therefore impairment was indicated because indicators of impairment existed the company commenced the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis to determine the implied fair value of goodwill for the backflip reporting unit which was determined in the same manner utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  as part of the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis the company assigned the fair value of the backflip reporting unit as calculated under the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis to all the assets and liabilities including identifiable intangibles assets of that reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the excess of the fair value of the backflip reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities based on this assessment the company recorded an impairment charge of 32858 a further deterioration in the forecast or assumptions discussed above could result in an additional impairment charge at december 25 2016 there is 86253 of remaining goodwill related to the backflip reporting unit  based on its qualitative assessment of goodwill for all reporting units with the exception of backflip the company concluded there was no other impairment of goodwill during 2016 in addition the company completed its annual impairment tests of goodwill in the fourth
