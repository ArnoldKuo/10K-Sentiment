contents consumer interests change rapidly making it difficult to design and develop products which will be popular with children and families  the interests of children and families evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year to be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content products and play patterns which will capture childrens and families interests and imagination and quickly develop innovative products which can compete successfully for consumers limited time attention and spending this challenge is more difficult with the ever increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers evolving consumer tastes coupled with an ever changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for childrens and families interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced as a result individual family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles if we devote time and resources to developing entertainment and products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in significant quantities to be profitable to us our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will be damaged  additionally our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our entertainment and consumer product offerings by consumers in diverse markets around the world with different tastes and preferences as such our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience  the challenge of continuously developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of todays children and the increasing array of entertainment offerings available to them  children are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative technologydriven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies digital media and social media companies to meet this challenge we and our competitors are designing and marketing products which incorporate increasing technology seek to combine digital and analog play and capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media  with the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings there is no guarantee that            any of our brands products or product lines will achieve popularity or continue to be popular            any property for which we have a significant license will achieve or sustain popularity            any new products or product lines we introduce will be considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate market acceptance or            any products life cycle or sales quantities will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover our development manufacturing marketing royalties including royalty advances and guarantees and other costs of producing marketing and selling the product  the childrens and family entertainment industry is highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our revenues market share and profitability could decline  the childrens and family entertainment industry is and will continue to be highly competitive we compete in the united states and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers marketers and sellers of analog toys and games digital gaming products digital media products which combine analog and digital play and other entertainment and consumer products as well as with retailers we face competitors who    11    table of contents  are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase  in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the childrens and family entertainment industry are low and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets and has broadened the array of companies we compete with new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time these existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences our competitors products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products lower our revenues and lower our profitability  an inability to develop and introduce planned new brands products and product lines in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business  in developing new brands products and product lines we have anticipated dates for the associated product introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development implementation and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule there is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a costeffective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands this risk is heightened by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business the risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies utilizing digital media to a greater degree and providing greater innovation and product differentiation unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process significant increases in the planned cost of development or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or in some situations may cause a product introduction to be discontinued  united states global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers can harm our business and financial performance  we design manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate recessions credit crises and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the united states and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence similarly reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers such as their homes or stock market investments can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability  in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending andor sales allowances or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability    12    table of contents challenging market conditions in certain developed markets such as in the united states and certain western european countries make it more difficult for us to succeed  our future success in the united states and europe is impacted by market conditions a european sovereign debt crisis or other significant negative shock to european markets could lead to a recession in europe which may negatively impact consumers and in turn sales of our products in the european markets similar negative events impacting the market in the united states may harm our business  many components of the toy game and family entertainment industries in the united states and certain western european countries have not grown or in some cases have even contracted in recent years these markets represent a majority of our current product sales it is more difficult for us to grow or even maintain our business when the overall market in certain of the major countries we serve is not growing to succeed in a market that is stable or contracting we must gain market share from our competitors which is more difficult than growing in an expanding market as long as economic conditions in the united states and certain european markets remain difficult this will be an additional challenge we must face and overcome  loss of a significant licensed property could harm our business  in addition to developing and marketing products based on properties we own or control we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties  we currently have inlicenses to several successful entertainment properties including marvel star wars beyblade and sesame street these licenses typically have multiyear terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products in recent years our sales of products under the marvel star wars beyblade and sesame street licenses have been highly significant to our business if any of these licenses were to terminate and not be renewed or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license  our license to the marvel property is granted from marvel entertainment llc and marvel characters bv together marvel our license to the star wars property is granted by lucas licensing ltd and lucasfilm ltd together lucas both marvel and lucas are owned by the walt disney company  delays or increased costs associated with the development and offering of entertainment media based upon or related to our brands can harm our business and profitability  entertainment media in forms such as television motion pictures dvd releases and other media can provide popular platforms for consumers to experience our owned and licensed brands and the success or lack of success of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial success we spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties heavily impact the timing of media development release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts  the ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors and studio and media partners we do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit or released and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates this can make it difficult for us to plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture and other media releases given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts  when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business    13    table of contents lack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainment media for which we offer products can harm our business  motion pictures television or other media for which we develop products may not be as popular with consumers as we anticipated while it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of media efforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings if our and our partners media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed  the hub our cable television joint venture with discovery communications inc in the united states competes with a number of other childrens television networks for viewers advertising revenue and distribution fees there is no guarantee that the hub will be successful similarly hasbro studios programming distributed internationally competes with programming from many other parties lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of programming developed by hasbro studios or other programming appearing on the hub and products related to that programming could significantly harm our business similarly our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with our investment in the hub such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for the hub during 2012 the company paid 59277 for programming developed by hasbro studios and anticipates that it will continue spending at comparable levels in 2013 and future years  at december 30 2012 330746 or 76 of our total assets represented our investment in the hub if the hub does not achieve success or if there are subsequent declines in the success or profitability of the channel then our investment may become impaired which could result in a writedown through net earnings  part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporating greater technology and which marry digital and analog play the margins on many of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have short lifespans  as children have grown older younger and have otherwise become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products such as video games consumer electronics and social and digital media at younger and younger ages we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers one initiative we have pursued to capture the interest of children is to offer innovative childrens electronic toy and game products increasing the marriage between digital and analog gaming and increasing the technology in our gaming products is another key for our future strategy these electronic and digital products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales however childrens electronic and digital products in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks  our costs for designing developing and producing electronic and digital products or products that marry digital and analog technology tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions as a consequence our margins on the sales of these products can be lower than for more traditional products and we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games    14    table of contents other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate including rising commodity and fuel prices higher labor costs increased transportation costs outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability  various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and costeffective manner or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues profitability and business  significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary branded play entertainment products we offer as we discussed above weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability  our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business  other conditions such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product any of these factors could result in product delays increased costs andor lost sales for our products  our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations  we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 30 2012 our net revenues from international customers comprised approximately 50 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in fact over time we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets additionally as we discuss below we utilize thirdparty manufacturers located principally in the far east to produce the majority of our products and we have a manufacturing facility in ireland these sales and manufacturing operations including operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to the risks associated with international operations including            currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations            limitations on the repatriation of earnings            potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions            political instability civil unrest and economic instability            greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights            complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies    15    table of contents         difficulties understanding the retail climate consumer trends local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from the united states            natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom            difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another including port congestion strikes and other transportation delays and interruptions            changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally and            the imposition of tariffs quotas or other protectionist measures  because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business  changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance  our global operations mean we produce and buy products and sell products in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies as a result if the exchange rate between the united states dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results as reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected as an example if the dollar appreciates 10 relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had 200 million of net revenues the dollar value of those sales as they are translated into us dollars would decrease by 20 million in our consolidated financial results as such we would recognize a 20 million decrease in our net revenues even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed similarly our expenses in foreign markets can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control  we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties  in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by third parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as marvel star wars beyblade or sesame street related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties  the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 30 2012 we had 163875 of prepaid royalties 86361 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 77514 of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 30 2012 we may be required to pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 227000 acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainmentbased properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy game or other family entertainment products and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us    16    table of contents we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed  our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season this seasonality is exacerbated by retailers quick response inventory management techniques  sales of our toys games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season including christmas this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailers investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier  the limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to fully meet consumer demand additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in our underproducing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season  the concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us  we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 30 2012 walmart stores inc toys r us inc and target corporation accounted for approximately 17 11 and 10 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart toys r us and target in the aggregate accounted for approximately 42 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 64 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of    17    table of contents  their purchases from us favor competitors or new entrants increase their direct competition with us by expanding their privatelabel business change their purchasing patterns alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products or return substantial amounts of our products it could significantly harm our sales profitability and financial condition customers make no binding longterm commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products in addition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers furthermore the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability  our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce the majority of our toy products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business  we own and operate two manufacturing facilities one in east longmeadow massachusetts and the other in waterford ireland however most of our products are manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers most of whom are located in the peoples republic of china china although our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a significant period of time to alternative sources of supply should such changes be necessary if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political civil labor or other factors beyond our control including natural disasters or pandemics our operations may be substantially disrupted potentially for a significant period of time this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured  given that the majority of our toy manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers located in china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china labor shortages and increases in labor costs in china as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in china out of asia and through the ports in north america and europe whether due to port congestion labor disputes product regulations andor inspections or other factors and natural disasters or health pandemics impacting china also the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations by the united states or the european union against products imported by us from or the loss of normal trade relations status with china could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a thirdparty manufacturer by government inspectors in china could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales  we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured by or for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions our global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition we require that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right and exercises such right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us    18    table of contents difficulties associated with the implementation of our plan to reinvent our gaming business may harm our revenues and profitability  recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful in the gaming business in the future we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business the objective of this plan was to stabilize our gaming business in 2012 and to position it to grow in 2013 and beyond our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involves substantial changes in how we market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail a focus on delivering industry leading innovation in gaming a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming we also are designing our gaming products to recognize the need to provide immersive game play in shorter periods of time and to offer innovative face to face and off the board gaming opportunities our failure to successfully implement our strategy to reinvent our gaming business and to otherwise stabilize and grow our gaming business in the future could substantially harm our business resulting in lost revenues and lost profits there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our global gaming strategy  our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees  our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our branded play efforts it is their skill innovation and hard work that drive our success we compete with many other potential employers in recruiting hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees there is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit hire or retain the senior management officers and other employees we need to succeed our loss of key management or other employees or our inability to hire talented people we need in the future could significantly harm our business  to remain competitive we must continuously work to increase efficiency and reduce costs but there is no guarantee we will be successful in this regard  our business is extremely competitive the pace of change in our industry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable to compete we must continuously improve our processes increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses to improve our profitability and competitiveness in the fourth quarter of 2012 we implemented a global cost savings initiative the objective of this initiative is to reduce our operating costs by an annual amount of 100 million by 2015 we intend to achieve this by focusing on fewer more global brand initiatives workforce reductions facility consolidation and other process improvements however this is no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings goals  we rely on external financing including our credit facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed  due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2017 which provides for a 700000 committed revolving credit facility the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations  we also have a commercial paper program which subject to market conditions allows us to issue up to 700000 in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a further source of working    19    table of contents  capital funding and liquidity there is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms or at all at any given point in time at december 30 2012 there was 209200 outstanding under this program  not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding  we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities  as of december 30 2012 we had 1384895 of total principal amount of longterm debt outstanding if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all  as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business  as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the united states under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation

commission and a host of other agencies globally and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions of the childrens online privacy protection act while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these acts could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations  governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business    20    table of contents as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition  our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully in addition we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our net earnings  our intellectual property including our license agreements and other agreements that establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property is of great value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the united states and around the world from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in the united states and around the world in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and competitive position much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our balance sheet however as of december 30 2012 we had 416659 of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization  acquisitions have been a component of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings in making acquisitions we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings in the case of our joint venture with discovery we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels however we cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we may acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products or services in the future  failure to operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability  we rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including management of our supply chain sale and delivery of our products and various other process transactions we are dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as hurricanes fires floods earthquakes tornadoes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees the efficient    21    table of contents  operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability  if our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed  we maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world this data relates to all aspects of our business and also contains certain customer and consumer data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data in addition we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third party business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data any compromise of the confidential data of our customers our consumers or ourselves could have a negative effect on our business  from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense  as is the case with many large multinational corporations we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in significant numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations  we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net earnings  goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment at december 30 2012 474925 or 110 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations
