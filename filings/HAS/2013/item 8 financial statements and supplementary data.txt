has certain intangible assets related to the tonka and milton bradley acquisitions that have an indefinite life  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a twostep process that begins with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value also calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows  the remaining intangibles having defined lives are

not be recoverable recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values depending on the nature of the assets assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of the net book value or their estimated fair value less disposal costs  financial instruments  hasbros financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable shortterm borrowings accounts payable and certain accrued

measure the fair value of these securities certain other availableforsale securities held by the company are valued at the net asset value which is quoted on a private market that is not active however the unit price is predominantly based on underlying investments which are traded on an active market in 2012 the company purchased an availableforsale investment which invests in hedge funds which contain financial instruments that are valued using certain estimates which are considered unobservable in that they reflect the investment managers own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability the company believes that these estimates are the best information available for use in the fair value of this investment the companys derivatives consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts the company uses current forward rates of the respective foreign currencies to measure the fair value of these contracts at december 25 2011 the companys derivatives also included interest rate swaps used to effectively adjust the interest rates on a portion of the companys longterm debt from fixed to variable the fair values of the interest rate swaps were measured based on the present value of future cash flows using the swap curve as of the valuation date the remaining derivative instruments consist of warrants to purchase common stock of an unrelated company the company uses the blackscholes model to value these warrants one of the inputs used in the blackscholes model historical volatility is considered an unobservable input in that it reflects the companys own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability the company believes that this is the best
