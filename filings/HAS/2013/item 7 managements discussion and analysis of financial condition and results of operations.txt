as a result of the mix of entertainmentbased and nonentertainment based product sales further the decline in operating profit margin in 2012 compared to 2011 reflects the change in geographical mix of net revenues with a higher percentage coming from emerging markets which currently have lower operating profit margins than the company has in developed markets in 2011 the increase in operating

estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the television program and include toy game and other merchandise licensing fees first run program distribution fees and other revenue sources such as dvd and digital distribution our ultimate revenue estimates for each television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information if estimates for a television program are revised the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations in the    40    table of contents  quarter in which the estimates are revised prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our television programs in the us which are distributed on the hub and available on netflix and itunes our ability to achieve broad distribution and viewer acceptance in international markets and success of our programrelated toy game and other merchandise  for the year ended december 30 2012 we have 91975 of program production costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet we currently expect that substantially all capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3year period 2013 through 2015 future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and managements then current estimates of ultimate revenues during 2012 the company did not incur any significant impairment charges related to its program production costs  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows  the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach the companys annual goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the estimated fair value of the companys reporting units with allocated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying value no reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing the first step of the impairment test accordingly no impairment was indicated the companys annual impairment tests related to intangible assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth quarter of 2012 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying value of the related assets the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge at december 30 2012 the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of 550663 recorded on the balance sheet  intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 340921 at december 30 2012 during 2012 there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets    41    table of contents recoverability of royalty advances and commitments  the companys ability to earnout royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the nonrecoverable minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 30 2012 the company had 163875 of prepaid royalties 86361 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 77514 of which are included in other assets  pension costs and obligations  pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the us with no future benefits accruing to employees the company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze the estimates for the companys us plans are established at the companys measurement date the company uses its fiscal yearend date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year  the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the companys estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2012 pension expense for the us plans was 700 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2012 pension expense for us plans by approximately 650  discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the companys discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2012 pension expense averaged 496 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the companys discount rate would have increased 2012 pension expense by approximately 430  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods at december 30 2012 the companys us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of 138946 included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to 104872 at december 25 2011 the increase primarily reflects additional unrecognized actuarial losses in 2012 primarily due to the reduction of the discount rate used to measure plan obligations at december 30 2012 partially offset by the amount by which the companys 2012 actual return on plan assets exceeded the expected return assumed in the calculation of the 2012 expense the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december 30 2012 decreased to 409 at december 30 2012 from 496 used at december 25 2011 a decrease of 025 in the companys discount rate would have increased the 2012 projected benefit obligation by approximately 12026 pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains    42    table of contents income taxes  the companys annual income tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the companys annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions despite the companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges these estimated liabilities are adjusted as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit  an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the companys interim results in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the companys interim results the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time changes in the companys estimated effective income tax rate during 2012 were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction in addition changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs during 2012 the company recorded a total benefit of approximately 8300 associated with discrete tax events primarily related to the repatriation of certain highly taxed foreign earnings as well as expirations of statutes in multiple jurisdictions  in certain cases tax law requires items to be included in the companys income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on the companys tax returns while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time such as depreciation expense these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the companys income tax returns valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income including capital gains to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the companys income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the companys financial statements or income recognized in the financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the companys income tax return deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as most of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company in the event the company determines that such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries at december 30 2012 the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries on cumulative undistributed earnings was approximately 393000  the mexican government has a tax structure which results in companies paying the higher of an incomebased tax or an alternative flat tax should the company be subject to the alternative flat tax it would be required to review whether its net deferred tax assets would be realized as the company believes that it will continue to be subject to the incomebased tax in 2013 it believes that the net deferred tax assets related to the mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable should the facts and circumstances change the company may be required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its mexican operations which may result in additional tax expense at december 30 2012 these deferred tax assets were approximately 7300    43    table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments  in the normal course of its business the company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license which may require the payment of minimum guarantees as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment in addition the company has 1384895 in principal amount of longterm debt outstanding at december 30 2012 future payments required under these and other obligations as of december 30 2012 are as follows                                        payments due by fiscal year     certain contractual

liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 30 2012 the company has a liability including potential interest and penalties of 123444 for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns the company does not know the ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability accordingly these amounts are not included in the table above  in connection with the companys agreement to form a joint venture with discovery the company is obligated to make future payments to discovery under a tax sharing agreement these payments are contingent upon the company having sufficient taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related to the joint venture accordingly estimates of these amounts are included in the table above  the companys agreement with marvel provides for minimum guaranteed royalty payments and requires the company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities in connection with the extension of the marvel license in 2009 the company may be subject to additional royalty guarantees totaling 140000 that are not included in the table above and that may be payable during the next six years contingent upon the quantity and types of theatrical movie releases approximately 30000 of these additional royalty guarantees are expected to be paid in 2013 based on the theatrical release of iron man 3  purchase commitments represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase inventory and tooling in the ordinary course of business the reported amounts exclude inventory and tooling purchase liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 30 2012  in addition to the amounts included in the table above the company expects to make contributions totaling approximately 5800 related to its unfunded us and other international pension plans in 2013 the company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately 194221 at december 30 2012  the company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above  financial risk management  the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars hong kong dollars and euros while marketing    44    table of contents  those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real russian ruble and mexican peso and to a lesser extent currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries  to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate 61622 decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions  the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the companys revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts  the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 30 2012 these contracts had net unrealized losses of 1720 of which 1729 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets 12 are recorded in other assets 3106 are recorded in accrued liabilities and 355 are recorded in other liabilities included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 30 2012 are deferred losses of 1008 net of tax related to these derivatives  at december 30 2012 the company had fixed rate longterm debt excluding adjustments of 1384895 the company was party to several interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 400000 to adjust the amount of longterm debt subject to fixed interest rates the interest rate swaps were matched with specific longterm debt issues and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt changes in fair value of these contracts were wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related longterm debt in november 2012 these interest rate swap agreements were terminated the fair value was recorded as an adjustment to longterm debt and is now being amortized through the statement of operations over the life of the remaining longterm debt using a straightline method at december 30 2012 this adjustment to longterm debt was 11526 as a result of this termination longterm debt is no longer affected by variable interest rates and thereby earnings and cash flows are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates the company estimates that a hypothetical quarter percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this longterm debt by approximately 31000  the economy and inflation  the principal market for the companys products is the retail sector revenues from the companys top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 42 of its consolidated net revenues in 2012 and 45 and 50 of its consolidated net revenues in 2011 and 2010 respectively in recent years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate  the companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2012 approximately 64 of the companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing    45    table of contents  strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas  quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the companys future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the companys significant retailers could negatively impact the companys future revenues  the effect of inflation on the companys operations during 2012 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly  other information  the company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position
