finally we offer targeted events for cios and it executives such as cio leadership forumcompetition we believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are the following superior it research content  we believe that we create the broadest highestquality and most relevant research coverage of the it industry with offerings for every member of an it organization our research analysis generates unbiased insight that we believe is timely thoughtprovoking and comprehensive and that is known for its high quality independence and objectivityour leading brand name  we

2014 we had 1556 research analysts and consultants located around the world our analysts collectively speak 50 languages and are located in 26 countries enabling us to cover all aspects of it on a global basisnotwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly with consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services while we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition increased competition could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures intellectual property our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies software reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights we have policies related to confidentiality ownership and the use and protection of gartners intellectual property we also enter into agreements with our employees as appropriate that protect our intellectual property and we enforce these agreements if necessary we recognize the

environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions the following sections discuss many but not all of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance but is not intended to be allinclusive any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additionally risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and negatively affect your investment risks related to our business our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic conditions our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends in the us and abroad us economic data continues to be mixed but the overall economy continues to grow and unemployment continues to fall however economic growth continues to be uneven globally with continuing weakness across europe and emerging markets as recent geopolitical events add to the uncertainty these conditions could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products and services such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth attract attendees and exhibitors to our events or obtain new clients such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition low barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely 6delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price we may not be able to maintain the quality of our existing products and services we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our data viewpoints or predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner including via the internet and mobile applications failure to maintain state of the art electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain competitive the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis on the it industry as a whole the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to anticipate the needs of our client organizations develop enhance and improve our existing as well as new products and services to address those needs deliver all products and services in a timely userfriendly and state of the art manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of developing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or services releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position we depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services could lead to a decrease in our revenues a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted 72 and 71 of our total revenues for 2014 and 2013 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is a challenging costly and often time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affectedthe majority of our research subscription agreements are for twelve months however we do enter into multiyear agreements which have been increasing in frequency our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following delivering highquality and timely analysis and advice to our clientsunderstanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of our clients anddelivering products and services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competitionadditionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research enterprise client retention rate was 85 at december 31 2014 and 83 at december 31 2013 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues consulting segment revenues constituted 17 of our total revenues in 2014 and 18 in 2013 consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following delivering consistent highquality consulting services to our clientstailoring our consulting services to the changing needs of our clients andour ability to match the skills and competencies of our consulting staff to the skills required for the fulfillment of existing or potential consulting engagements7any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition in addition revenue in our contract optimization business can fluctuate from period to period  the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be adversely affected by external factors beyond our control the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and suitable venues for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns reductions in government spending geopolitical crises terrorist attacks weather natural disasters communicable diseases and other occurrences impacting the global regional or national economies the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event we also face the challenge of procuring venues that are sizeable enough at a reasonable cost to accommodate some of our major events  our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated we derive significant revenues from research and consulting contracts with the us government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2014 and 2013 approximately 3100 million and 2830 million respectively of our total contracts were attributable to government entities we believe substantially all of the amounts attributable to government entities at december 31 2014 will be filled in 2015 our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services additionally our contracts at the state and local levels as well as foreign government contracts are subject to various governmental authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause or penalty termination for convenience similarly contracts with us federal state and local and foreign governments and their respective agencies are subject to increasingly complex bidding procedures compliance requirements and intense competition should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should our government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of segment and consolidated revenues we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize our future growth plans as well as the quality of our products and services our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals recent improvements in the us economy have heightened this competition additionally some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any inability to retain key personnel or to hire and train additional qualified personnel to support the evolving needs of clients or the projected growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name we believe that our gartner brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be adversely impacted our international operations expose us to a variety of operational risks which could negatively impact our future revenue and growth we have clients in over 90 countries and a substantial amount of our revenues is earned outside of the us our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations differences between us and foreign tax rates and laws and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent we are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates from our international operations revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the us dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations additionally our effective tax rate is increased as the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies which could impact our operating results 8 natural disasters or geopolitical events may disrupt our business a major weather event terrorist attack earthquake flood volcanic activity or other catastrophic disaster could significantly disrupt our operations such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing and business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel our corporate headquarters is located approximately 30 miles from new york city and we have an operations center located in ft myers florida a hurricaneprone area we also operate in numerous international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe abrupt political change terrorist activity communicable diseases and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries and regions which may negatively impact our sales and increase our operating costs additionally these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget decisions of our clients such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition and operating resultsprivacy concerns could damage our reputation and deter current and potential clients from using our products and services or attending our events concerns relating to global data privacy have the potential to damage our reputation and deter current and prospective clients from using our products and services or attending our events in the ordinary course of our business and in accordance with applicable laws we collect personal information i from our employees ii from the users of our products and services including event attendees and iii from prospective clients we collect only basic personal information from our clients and prospects name email address job title and do not as a rule collect sensitive personal information like ssns and credit card numbers even if unfounded concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of this personal information or other data privacy related matters could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results in addition because many of our products and services are webbased the amount of data we store on our servers including personal information has been increasing any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the disclosure of our users personal data could seriously limit the consumption of our products and services and the attendance at our events as well as harm our reputation and brand and therefore our business  in addition while we are a safe harbor certified company and while we have implemented a companywide privacy compliance program regulatory authorities around the world continue to adopt new laws regulations and penalties concerning data privacy the interpretation and application of these laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain inconsistent and ever changing it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data privacy practices complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business internet and critical internal computer system failures cyberattacks or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely heavily on computer systems to conduct our operations individuals groups and statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our operations our computer systems our employees and our customers they may develop and deploy malicious software to gain access to our networks and attempt to steal confidential information launch distributed denial of service attacks or attempt other coordinated disruptions these threats are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them a cyberattack widespread internet failure or disruption of our critical information technology systems through denial of service viruses or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial results we take steps to secure our management information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers may be vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events our reputation brand financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if as a result of a significant cyber event or other technologyrelated catastrophe our operations are disrupted or shutdown our confidential proprietary information is stolen or disclosed we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer employee or other confidential information we are required to dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs as a result of these occurrenceswe may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect 9to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites and to deliver our products and services through emerging channels such as mobile applications however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers potentially harming our financial condition and operating resultsour outstanding debt obligation could impact our financial condition or future operating results we have a credit arrangement that provides for a fiveyear 4000 million term loan and a 11 billion revolving credit facility the 2014 credit agreement in addition the credit arrangement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving facility may be increased at our option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 5000 million in the aggregate at december 31 2014 we had a total of 4000 million outstanding under the term loan of the 2014 credit agreement the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2014 credit agreement could limit our future financial flexibility additionally a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the arrangement which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so in this current financial climate or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the credit arrangement the associated debt service costs of this credit arrangement could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all we believe that our existing cash balances projected cash flow from operations and the borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our plans for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future however we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital including acquisitions if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings or issue debt prevailing credit and debt market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret patent confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights our employees are subject to noncompete agreements to the extent permitted under applicable law when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts  we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services or otherwise support our growth objectives the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders should we issue stock in the acquisition decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day to day business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions 10we face risks related to litigation we are and in the future may be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits and despite vigorous efforts to defend any such claim can affect our reputation and responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a claim is made against us which we cannot defend or resolve on reasonable terms our business brand and financial results could be materially and adversely affectedwe face risks related to taxation we are a global company with operations and clients in over 90 countries a substantial amount of our earnings is generated outside of the us and taxed at rates significantly less than the us statutory federal income tax rate our effective tax rate financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates and conversely lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets andor by changes in tax laws or accounting principles and their interpretation by relevant authorities at the present time the united states and other countries where we do business have either changed or are actively considering changes in their tax accounting and other related laws in the united states proposed tax law changes particularly those directed at taxing unremitted and future foreign earnings could increase our effective tax rate in addition ireland recently modified its tax residency rules while at the present time these changes are not effective until 2020 for many companies with irish resident operations including gartner the new rules could increase our effective tax rate at that future date likewise certain international organizations such as the organization for economic development and cooperation are actively considering proposals certain of which if enacted by foreign governments could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business these actual potential and other changes both individually and collectively could materially increase our effective tax rate and negatively impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition our tax filings for various years are subject to examination by domestic and international taxing authorities and during the ordinary course of business we are under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax filings and related accruals are reasonable the final resolution of tax audits may be materially different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows particularly in major taxing jurisdictions including but not limited to the united states ireland india canada united kingdom japan france and italyour corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations we operate in a number of countries including emerging markets and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations as a result we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however if any employee fails to comply with or intentionally disregards any of these laws regulations or our policies a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business risks related to our common stock our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the expectations of investors or the financial guidance we have given which may cause the price of our common stock to decline our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of investors or the financial guidance we have previously provided if this occurs the price of our common stock could decline our stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid the price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions geo11political events changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts expectations for any quarterly period as well as other factors outside of our control including any and all factors that move the securities markets generally these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market at the present time we are executing against a boardapproved share repurchase program to reduce the number of outstanding shares of our common stock at december 31 2014 4133 million remained available for share purchases under this program no assurance can be given that we will continue these activities in the future when the program is completed or in the event that the price of our common stock reaches levels at which repurchases are not accretive as of december 31 2014 the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards under these plans was approximately 29 million shares approximately 06 million of which have vested in addition at the present time approximately 80 million shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans shares of common stock issued under these plans are freely transferable and have been registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities act except for any shares held by affiliates as that term is defined in rule 144 under the securities act which are subject to certain limitations we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours to our knowledge as of the date hereof and based upon publiclyavailable sec filings four institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholdersour antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stockadvance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings andthe antitakeover provisions of delaware lawthese provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock item 1b

financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k provides additional information regarding the 2014 acquisitions the operating results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated and segment operating results beginning on their respective dates of acquisition the results of these businesses were not material to our consolidated or segment results for the year ended december 31 2014  fluctuations in quarterly results our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter as well as other events the timing and amount of new business generated the mix between domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of our new products and services competition in the industry general economic conditions and other factors which are beyond our control the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below the preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the companys financial statements in future periods our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of us gaap and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition sab 104 revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products and are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term fees from research reprints are recognized when the reprint is delivered consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered andor services are provided revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment18events revenues are deferred and then recognized upon the completion of the related symposium conference or exhibitionthe majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim uncollectible fees receivable  we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands  december 31

financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed on a periodic basis should events or circumstances indicate potential impairment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge against earnings among the factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review are the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating resultssignificant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall businesssignificant negative industry or general economic trendssignificant decline in our stock price for a sustained period andour market capitalization relative to net book valuethe annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill can be based on either a quantitative or qualitative assessment or a combination of the two both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty in 2014 we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test utilizing a qualitative approach based on this assessment the company believes the fair values of the companys reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying amounts see note 1  business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion accounting for income taxes  the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we consider the availability of loss carryforwards projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in making this assessment the company recognizes the tax 19benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position accounting for stockbased compensation  the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 sab no 107 and no 110 sab no 110 the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 8  stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stockbased compensation determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the companys common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the companys stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period restructuring and other accruals  we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates

reimbursements in the 2013 period related to the completion of the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility investing cash used in our investing activities declined by 182 million in 2013

not yet become effective and may impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods are described below together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in future periodsrevenue recognitionin may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asu no 201409 asu no 201409 is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by removing inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue recognition requirements providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues improving comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities industries jurisdictions and capital markets and providing more useful information to users of financial statements through improved revenue disclosure requirements the provisions of the new rule are effective for gartner on january 1 2017 early adoption is not permitted we continue to evaluate the impact of asu no 201409 discontinued operationsin may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity asu 201408 which changes the criteria for determining which disposal transactions can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements under the new guidance a discontinued operation is defined as a disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results the company adopted the new rule on january 1 2015 and it did not have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements the fasb also continues to work on a number of significant accounting rules which may impact the companys accounting and disclosures in future periods since these rules have not yet been issued the effective dates and potential impact are unknown 31item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate risk the companys 2014 credit agreement provides for a fiveyear 4000 million term loan and a 11 billion revolving credit facility we have exposure to changes in interest rates arising from borrowings under the 2014 credit agreement since amounts borrowed are based on a floating base rate of interest at december 31 2014 we had 4000 million outstanding under the term portion of the 2014 credit agreement and zero under the revolver we have an interest rate swap contract which effectively converts the floating base rate on the first 2000 million of our borrowings to a 226 fixed rate since the company only hedges the base interest rate risk on the first 2000 million of its outstanding borrowings we are exposed to interest rate risk on floating rate borrowings in excess of 2000 million assuming the company borrowed the entire 15 billion under the 2014 credit agreement as of december 31 2014 a 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates could change pretax annual interest expense by approximately 33 millionforeign currency risk for both the fiscal years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 approximately 45 of our revenues were derived from sales outside of the us as a result we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar this foreign currency exposure results in both translation risk and transaction risk translation riskwe are exposed to foreign currency translation risk since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency translation risk arises since the assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and these exchange rates fluctuate over time for accounting purposes these foreign currency translation adjustments are deferred and are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and do not impact our operating results a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our consolidated balance sheets can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2014 we had over 3650 million of cash and cash equivalents with a substantial portion denominated in foreign currencies if the foreign exchange rates of the five major foreign currencies in which we operate changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2014 could have increased or decreased by approximately 240 million because our foreign subsidiaries generally operate in a local functional currency that differs from the us dollar revenues and expenses in these foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar continuously weakens or strengthens against these other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations historically this impact on our consolidated earnings has not been material since foreign currency movements in the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally transaction risk we also have foreign exchange transaction risk since foreign subsidiaries typically enter into transactions in the normal course of business that are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the local functional currency in which the foreign subsidiary operates we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of foreign currency transaction risk these contracts are normally short term in duration and both realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in current period earnings at december 31 2014 we had 77 outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional amount of approximately 456 million and an immaterial net unrealized gain substantially all of these contracts matured by the end of january 2015 credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and an interest rate swap contract the majority of the companys cash and cash equivalents and its interest rate swap contract are with large investment grade commercial banks accounts receivable balances collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion32 item 8 financial statements and supplementary data our consolidated financial statements for 2014 2013 and

from the 2014 acquisitions 3during 2014 and subsequent to the 2014 acquisitions the company recorded certain working capital tax and other minor adjustments which decreased the recorded goodwill resulting from the marketvisio and sircleit inc acquisitions by approximately 01 million and 02 million respectively in addition the recorded amount of an amortizable intangible asset resulting from the software advice acquisition was reduced by 27 million and goodwill was increased by the same amount due to a change in the underlying assumptions used to value the amortizable intangible asset based on the consideration of additional information that became available 4the company paid 1146 million in cash on a gross basis for the net assets acquired through december 31 2014 on a net basis

the purchased companies the determination of the fair value of the amortizable intangibles required management judgment and the consideration of a number of factors significant among them the historical financial performance of the acquired businesses and projected performance estimates surrounding customer turnover as well as assumptions regarding the level of competition and the cost to reproduce certain assets in determining the fair value of the intangibles management primarily relied on income methodologies in particular the discounted cash flow approach establishing the useful lives of the amortizable intangibles also required management judgment and the evaluation of a number of factors among them projected cash flows and the likelihood of competition the company considers the allocation of the purchase price for the 2014 acquisitions to be preliminary with respect to certain tax contingencies the majority of the recorded goodwill and intangibles from these transactions

which the related service is performed which is generally the same as the vesting period currently the company issues treasury shares upon the exercise release or settlement of stockbased compensation awards determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stockbased compensation awards and the common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the amount of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent managements best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the companys stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stockbased compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period the company recognized the following amounts of stockbased

the renovation of the companys stamford headquarters facility as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 the company had unrecognized tax benefits of 206 million and 145 million respectively the

shortterm nature the companys financial instruments also includes borrowings outstanding under its 2014 credit agreement and at december 31 2014 the company had 4000 million of floating rate debt outstanding under this arrangement which is carried at amortized cost the company believes the carrying amount of the outstanding borrowings reasonably approximates fair value since the rate of interest on the borrowings reflect current market rates of interest for similar instruments with comparable maturities fasb asc topic 820 provides a framework for the measurement of fair value and a valuation hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs used in the valuation of assets and liabilities classification within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the resulting fair value measurement the valuation hierarchy contains three levels level 1 measurements consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 measurements include significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves and other marketcorroborated inputs level 3 measurements include significant unobservable inputs such as internallycreated valuation models the company does not currently utilize level 3 valuation inputs to remeasure any of its assets or liabilities however level 3 inputs may be used by the company in its required annual impairment review of goodwill information regarding the periodic assessment of the companys goodwill is included in note 1  business and significant accounting policies the company does not typically transfer assets or
