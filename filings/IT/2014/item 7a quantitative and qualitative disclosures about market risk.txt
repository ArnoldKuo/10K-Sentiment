 interest rate risk we have exposure to changes in interest rates arising from borrowings under our 2013 credit agreement at december 31 2013 we had 2000 million outstanding under the 2013 credit agreement which consisted of 1444 million outstanding under the term loan and 556 million outstanding under the revolveramounts borrowed under the 2013 credit agreement bear interest at a rate equal to at gartners option either 1 the greatest of the administrative agents prime rate the average rate on overnight federal funds plus 12 of 1 and the eurodollar rate adjusted for statutory reserves plus 1 in each case plus a margin equal to between 025 and 075 depending on gartners leverage ratio as of the end of the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended or 2 the eurodollar rate adjusted for statutory reserves plus a margin equal to between 125 and 175 depending on gartners leverage ratio as of the end of the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended  we have an interest rate swap contract which effectively converts the floating base rate on the first 2000 million of our borrowings to a 226 fixed rate the company only hedges the base interest rate risk on the first 2000 million of its outstanding borrowings accordingly we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings in excess of 2000 million a 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates could change pretax annual interest expense on the additional revolver borrowing capacity under the 2013 credit agreement not including the expansion feature by approximately 09 millionforeign currency risk for the fiscal years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 45 and 46 of our revenues respectively were derived from sales outside of the us as a result we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar our foreign currency exposure results in both translation risk and transaction risk translation riskwe are exposed to foreign currency translation risk since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency translation risk arises since the assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and these exchange rates fluctuate over time these foreign currency translation adjustments are deferred and are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and do not impact our operating results a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our condensed consolidated balance sheets can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2013 we had almost 4240 million of cash and cash equivalents with approximately 58 denominated in foreign currencies if the foreign exchange rates of the major currencies in which we operate changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2013 would have increased or decreased by approximately 200 million because our foreign subsidiaries generally operate in a local functional currency that differs from the us dollar revenues and expenses in these foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar continuously weakens or strengthens against these other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations historically this impact on our consolidated earnings has not been material since foreign currency movements in the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally transaction risk we also have foreign exchange transaction risk since foreign subsidiaries typically enter into transactions in the normal course of business that are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the local functional currency in which the foreign subsidiary operates we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of foreign currency transaction risk these contracts are normally short term in duration and unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized in current period earnings at december 31 2013 we had 89 outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional amount of approximately 610 million and an immaterial net unrealized loss substantially all of these contracts matured by the end of january 2014 31credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and an interest rate swap contract the majority of the companys cash and cash equivalents and its interest rate swap contract are with large investment grade commercial banks that are participants in the companys 2013 credit agreement accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion
