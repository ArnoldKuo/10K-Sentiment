measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments business segment business measurementsresearch contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscriptionrelated research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time without regard to the duration of the contract     client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients who were also clients a year ago by all clients from a year ago     wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelvemonth period wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients who were clients one year earlier by the total contract value from a year earlier excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange when wallet retention exceeds client retention it is an indication of retention of higherspending clients or increased spending by retained clients or both   consulting consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from inprocess consulting measurement and strategic advisory services engagements     utilization rate represents a measure of productivity of our consultants utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill     billing rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours     average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year   events number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period     number of attendees represents the total number of people who attend events executive summary of operations and financial position we have executed a consistent growth strategy since 2005 to drive doubledigit annual revenue and earnings growth the fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research content delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings building a strong sales capability providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention and continuously improving our operational effectiveness we had total revenues of 17842 million in 2013 an increase of 10 over 2012 while diluted earnings per share increased by 20 per share to 193 excluding the impact of foreign currency 2013 total revenues increased 11 over 2012 research revenues rose 12 yearoveryear to 12710 million in 2013 and the contribution margin increased 1 point to 69 at december 31 2013 research contract value was 14232 million an increase of 13 over december 31 2012 and 12 adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange client retention was 82 and wallet retention was 98 at december 31 2013 16consulting revenues in 2013 increased 3 compared to 2012 while the gross contribution margin was 34 consultant utilization was 64 for 2013 compared to 67 in 2012 and we had 509 billable consultants at december 31 2013 compared to 503 at yearend 2012 backlog increased 3 yearoveryear to 1061 million at december 31 2013 events revenues increased 14 yearoveryear to 1989 million while the segment contribution margin was 46 we held 64 events in 2013 compared to 62 in 2012 with a slight decline in the number of attendees for a more detailed discussion of our results see the segment results section below cash flow from our operating activities increased 13 in 2013 compared to 2012 to 3157 million we continued to focus on maximizing shareholder value in 2013 and we repurchased 34 million of our outstanding common shares during the year we ended 2013 with almost 4240 million in cash and cash equivalents which is a record yearend cash balance we refinanced our debt in 2013 to take advantage of favorable market conditions and as of yearend 2013 we had over 5410 million of borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs fluctuations in quarterly results our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter as well as other events the timing and amount of new business generated the mix between domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of our new products and services competition in the industry general economic conditions and other factors which are beyond our control the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below the preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the companys financial statements in future periods our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  revenue is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 101 and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition sab 104 revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products and are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term fees from research reprints are recognized when the reprint is shippedconsulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered andor services are provided revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their paymentevents revenues are deferred and then recognized upon the completion of the related symposium conference or exhibitionthe majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal 17funding clauses it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim uncollectible fees receivable  we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands december 31 2013 2012total fees receivable497923

fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed on a periodic basis should events or circumstances indicate potential impairment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is less than its related carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge against earnings among the factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review are the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating resultssignificant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall businesssignificant negative industry or general economic trendssignificant decline in our stock price for a sustained period andour market capitalization relative to net book valuethe annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill can be based on either a qualitative or qualitative assessment or a combination of the two both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty in 2013 we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test utilizing a qualitative approach based on this assessment the company believes the fair values of the companys reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts see note 1  business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion accounting for income taxes  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question we consider the availability of loss carryforwards existing deferred tax liabilities future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment is made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the period such determination is made 18accounting for stockbased compensation  the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 sab no 107 and no 110 sab no 110 the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 8  stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stockbased compensation determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the companys common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the companys stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period restructuring and other accruals  we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end19results of operations consolidated results 2013 versus 2012the following table presents the changes in selected line items

by segment 20cost of services and product development cos expense increased 8 in 2013 compared to 2012 or 544 million to 7135 million compared to 6591 million in 2012 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount as we continued to invest to support the growth in our business and to a lesser extent merit salary increases we also had higher conference costs due to an increase in the number of events a doubledigit increase in the number of exhibitors at our events and the upgrading of facilities in several locations to support anticipated growth in the events business these additional costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency cos as a percentage of revenues was 40 in the 2013 period compared to 41 in the 2012 period  selling general and administrative sgampa expense increased by 816 million in 2013 or 12 to 7605 million compared to 6788 million in 2012 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact the higher payroll and benefit cost was primarily driven by our investment in additional headcount and to a lesser extent higher sales commissions and merit salary increases the increased headcount includes additional quotabearing sales associates which increased to 1643 at december 31 2013 a 16 increase over yearend 2012 depreciation expense increased 14 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to additional depreciation on leasehold improvements from two renovated buildings on our stamford

ideas international acquisition in mid2012 acquisition and integration charges was 03 million in 2013 compared to 24 million in 2012 these charges related to the acquisition of ideas international in mid2012 and include legal consulting severance and other costs operating income increased 298 million yearoveryear or 12 to 2755 million in 2013 from 2457 million in 2012 the increased operating income was primarily attributable to a substantially higher segment contribution from our research segment operating income as a percentage of revenues was 15 for both periods  interest expense net was flat yearoveryear  other expense net was 02 million in 2013 and 13 million in 2012 these expenses primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses provision for income taxes

change in the annual mix of pretax income by jurisdiction as well as the impact of certain state tax credits recognized in 2012 during 2013 the company closed the internal revenue service irs audit of its 2008 and 2009 federal income tax returns the resolution of the audit did not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations of the

in 2012 from 2141 million in 2011 operating income as a percentage of revenues was 15 for both periods although both research and events had higher segment contributions in 2012 these increases were partially offset by a lower contribution in consulting as well as higher sgampa expenses as discussed above interest expense net declined by 11 in 2012 when compared to 2011 the decline was primarily due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding which declined to 2070 million in 2012 from 2200 million in 2011 as well as lower amortization of capitalized debt refinancing costs other expense net

primarily through cash generated from our operating activities for 2013 we had operating cash flow of 3157 million which was the highest in the companys history and represented an increase of 13 over 2012 our operating cash flow has been continuously enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscriptionbased business model as well as our focus on operational efficiencies revenues in our research segment which increased 12 in 2013 compared to 2012 constituted 71 and 70 of our total revenues in 2013 and 2012 respectively our research contracts generally renew annually and typically are

below together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our financial statements and related disclosures in future periodsin july 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201311 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists  asu 201311 asu 201311 addresses the balance sheet presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists asu 201311 requires that an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward asu no 201311 is effective for the companys fiscal quarter ending march 31 2014 and impacts balance sheet presentation only the company believes the balance sheet impact will not be materialin march 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201305 parents accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity asu no 201305 provides updated guidance to resolve diversity in practice concerning the release of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment into net income when a parent sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity when a company ceases to have a controlling financial interest the company should recognize any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary had resided upon a partial sale the company should release into earnings a pro rata portion of the cumulative translation adjustment asu no 201305 is effective for the companys fiscal quarter ending march 31 2014 the guidance in asu 201305 will only impact the companys financial statements upon the occurrence of a transaction within its scope the fasb also continues to work on a number of significant accounting rules which may impact the companys accounting and disclosures in future periods since these rules have not yet been issued the effective dates and potential impact are unknown 30
