 we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions the following sections discuss many but not all of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance but is not intended to be allinclusive any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additionally risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and negatively affect your investment risks related to our business our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic conditions our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends in the us and abroad economic growth continues to be both weak and uneven in many parts of the world in addition problems continue with government deficit spending in the us and other countries ongoing uncertainty in global trade and high levels of sovereign debt these conditions could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products and services such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth attract attendees and exhibitors to our events or obtain new clients such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price we may not be able to maintain our existing products and services we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain competitive the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for 6information and analysis on the it industry as a whole the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to anticipate the needs of our client organizations enhance and improve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services deliver all products and services in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or services releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position we depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services could lead to a decrease in our revenues a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted 71 and 70 of our revenues for 2013 and 2012 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is often a time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affectedour research subscription agreements are generally for twelve months although we do enter into multiyear agreements in certain circumstances our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following delivering highquality and timely analysis and advice to our clientsunderstanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of our clients anddelivering products and services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competitionadditionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research client retention rate was 82 at december 31 2013 and 83 at december 31 2012 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues consulting segment revenues constituted 18 of our total revenues in 2013 and 19 in 2012 consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following delivering consistent highquality consulting services to our clientstailoring our consulting services to the changing needs of our clients andour ability to match the skills and competencies of our consulting staff to the skills required for the fulfillment of existing or potential consulting engagementsany material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be adversely affected by external factors beyond our control the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and locations for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns reductions in government spending terrorist attacks weather natural disasters and other occurrences impacting the global regional or national economy the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event additionally a significant recovery in the global economy could make our ability to procure space for our events and efforts to keep associated costs down more challenging our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated we derive significant revenues from contracts with the us government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 2830 million and 2550 million 7respectively of our research contract value and consulting backlog was attributable to governments we believe substantially all of the amount attributable to governments at december 31 2013 will be filled in 2014 our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services additionally our contracts at the state and local levels as well as foreign government contracts are subject to various governmental authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause or penalty termination for convenience similarly contracts with domestic and foreign governments and their agencies are subject to increasingly complex bidding procedures and intense competition should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of segment and consolidated revenues we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our products and services our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name we believe that our gartner brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be adversely impacted our international operations expose us to a variety of operational risks which could negatively impact our future revenue and growth we have clients in 85 countries and a substantial amount of our revenues is earned outside of the us our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations differences between us and foreign tax rates and laws and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent our international operations expose us to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the us dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations natural disasters or geopolitical events may disrupt our business a major weather event terrorist attack earthquake flood volcanic activity or other catastrophic disaster could significantly disrupt our operations such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing and business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel our corporate headquarters is located approximately 30 miles from new york city and we have an operations center located in ft myers florida a hurricaneprone area we also operate in numerous international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries and regions which may negatively impact our sales and increase our operating costs additionally these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget decisions of our clients such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition and operating results internet and critical internal computer system failures cyberattacks or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely heavily on computer systems a cyberattack widespread internet failure or disruption of our critical information technology systems through viruses or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions such events could 8significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition and operating results we take steps generally acknowledged as standard for the industry to secure our management information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers may be vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events our reputation brand financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if as a result of a significant cyber event or other technologyrelated catastrophe our operations are disrupted or shutdown our confidential proprietary information is stolen or disclosed we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer employee or other confidential information we are required to dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs as a result of these occurrences we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers potentially harming our financial condition and operating resultsour outstanding debt obligation could impact our financial condition or future operating results we have a credit arrangement that provides for a fiveyear 1500 million term loan and a 6000 million revolving credit facility the 2013 credit agreement the credit arrangement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving facility may be increased at our option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 2500 million in the aggregate at december 31 2013 we had a total of 2000 million outstanding under the 2013 credit agreement the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2013 credit agreement could limit our future financial flexibility additionally a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the arrangement which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so in this current financial climate or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the credit arrangement the associated debt service costs of this credit arrangement could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all we believe that our existing cash balances projected cash flow from operations and the borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our plans for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future however we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings prevailing credit market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights9 we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions we face risks related to litigation we are and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits any such claim can affect our reputation and responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to settle the claim on reasonable terms our business brand results of operations or financial position could be materially and adversely affectedwe face risks related to taxation we operate in numerous jurisdictions around the world the company recognizes tax expense based upon the applicable tax rates and tax laws of the countries where income is generated a substantial amount of our income is generated outside of the us and is taxed at rates significantly less than the us statutory income tax rate of 35 the us and many other countries in which the company operates are considering proposals which may significantly change the taxation of income earned outside of the us our future effective tax rate financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in law or if more of our income is earned in higher taxing jurisdictions and less is earned in lower taxing jurisdictions in addition our tax filings for various years are subject to examination by taxing authorities and during the ordinary course of business we are under audit by one or more tax authorities although we believe that our tax filings are reasonable the final resolution of tax audits may be different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations we operate in a number of countries and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations as a result we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however if any employee fails to comply with or intentionally disregards any of these laws or regulations a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a material impact on our business risks related to our common stock our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors or guidance we have given which may cause the price of our common stock to decline our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future or guidance we have given if this occurs the price of our stock would likely decline our stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid the trading price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts recommendations 10regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts expectations for any quarterly period as well as other factors outside of our control these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market as of december 31 2013 the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards under these plans was approximately 36 million shares approximately 08 million of which have vested in addition approximately 64 million shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans shares of common stock issued under these plans are freely transferable without further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities act except for any shares held by affiliates as that term is defined in rule 144 under the securities act we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours to our knowledge as of december 31 2013 and based upon publiclyavailable sec filings five institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholdersour antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stockadvance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings andthe antitakeover provisions of delaware lawthese provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock
