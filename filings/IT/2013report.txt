the following       superior it research content  we believe that we create the broadest highestquality and most relevant research coverage of the it industry our research analysis generates unbiased insight that we believe is timely thoughtprovoking and comprehensive and that is known for its high quality independence and objectivity        our leading brand name  we have provided critical trusted insight under the gartner name for over 30 years        our global footprint and established customer base  we have a global presence with clients in 85 countries on six continents for both 2012 and 2011 46 of our revenues were derived from sales outside of the us        experienced management team  our management team is composed of it research veterans and experienced industry executives        substantial operating leverage in our business model  we have the ability to distribute our intellectual property and expertise across multiple platforms including research publications consulting engagements conferences and executive programs to derive incremental revenues and profitability        vast network of analysts and consultants  as of december 31 2012 we had 1405 research analysts and consultants located around the world our analysts collectively speak 47 languages and are located in 26 countries enabling us to cover all aspects of it on a global basis     notwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services however we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition increased competition may result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures   intellectual property    our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies software reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights we have policies related to confidentiality ownership and the use and protection of gartners intellectual property and we also enter into agreements with our employees as appropriate that protect our intellectual property and we enforce these agreements if necessary   we recognize the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously identify create and protect it additionally we actively monitor and enforce contract compliance by our end users   employees    we had 5468 employees as of december 31 2012 an increase of 10 compared to the prior year end as we continued to invest for future growth we have 976 employees located at our headquarters in stamford connecticut and a nearby office in trumbull connecticut 2198 employees located elsewhere in the united states and 2294 employees located outside of the united states our employees may be subject to

standing committees audit compensation and governancenominating   item 1a risk factors    we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions the following sections discuss many but not all of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance but is not intended to be allinclusive any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additionally risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and negatively affect your investment   risks related to our business    our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic conditions our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends in the us and abroad among these conditions are government deficit spending in the us and other countries ongoing uncertainty in global trade difficulties related to the refinancing of sovereign debt and currency stability in addition there continues to be risks related to one or more eurozone countries discontinuing the use of the euro as their currency these conditions could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products and services such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth attract attendees and exhibitors to our events or obtain new clients such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources   there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price   we may not be able to maintain our existing products and services we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results   we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain competitive the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis on the it industry as a whole the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to anticipate the needs of our client organizations enhance and improve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services deliver all products and services in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or services releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position   we depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services could lead to a decrease in our revenues a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted 70 and 69 of our revenues for 2012 and 2011 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is often a time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected   6    our research subscription agreements are generally for twelve months our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following       delivering highquality and timely analysis and advice to our clients        understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of our clients and        delivering products and services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competition    additionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research client retention rate was 83 at december 31 2012 and 82 at december 31 2011 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals   we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues consulting segment revenues constituted 19 of our total revenues for 2012 and 21 for 2011 consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following       delivering consistent highquality consulting services to our clients        tailoring our consulting services to the changing needs of our clients and        our ability to match the skills and competencies of our consulting staff to the skills required for the fulfillment of existing or potential consulting engagements     any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition   the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be adversely affected by external factors beyond our control the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and locations for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns terrorist attacks weather natural disasters and other occurrences impacting the global regional or national economy the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event and as the global economy recovers our ability to procure space for our events and keep associated costs down could become more challenging   our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated we derive significant revenues from contracts with the us government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2012 and 2011 approximately 2550 million and 2250 million respectively of our research contract value and consulting backlog was attributable to governments we believe substantially all of the amount attributable to governments at december 31 2012 will be filled in 2013 our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services and our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to various government authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause termination for convenience additionally many state governments their agencies and municipalities across the united states are under severe financial strain and are considering significant budget cuts should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of segment and consolidated revenues   we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our products and services our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results   we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name we believe that our gartner brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase  7    expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be adversely impacted   our international operations expose us to a variety of operational risks which could negatively impact our future revenue and growth we have clients in 85 countries and a substantial amount of our revenues are earned outside of the us our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations differences between us and foreign tax rates and laws and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent   our international operations expose us to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations   natural disasters or geopolitical events may disrupt our business a major weather event terrorist attack earthquake flood volcanic activity or other catastrophic disaster could significantly disrupt our operations such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing and business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel our corporate headquarters is located approximately 30 miles from new york city and we have an operations center located in ft myers florida a hurricaneprone area we also operate in numerous international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries and regions which may negatively impact our sales and increase our operating costs additionally these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget decisions of our clients such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition and operating results   internet and critical internal computer system failures cyberattacks or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely heavily on computer systems a cyberattack widespread internet failure or disruption of our critical information technology systems through viruses or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition and operating results   we take steps generally acknowledged as standard for the industry to secure our management information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers may be vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events our reputation brand financial condition andor operating results could be adversely affected if as a result of a significant cyber event or other technologyrelated catastrophe our operations are disrupted or shutdown our confidential proprietary information is stolen or disclosed we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer employee or other confidential information we are required to dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs as a result of these occurrences   we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers potentially harming our financial condition and operating results  8    our outstanding debt obligation could impact our financial condition or future operating results we have a credit arrangement that provides for a fiveyear 2000 million term loan and a 4000 million revolving credit facility the 2010 credit agreement the credit arrangement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving facility may be increased at our option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 1500 million in the aggregate which may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market conditions at both december 31 2012 and 2011 we had a total of 2000 million outstanding under the 2010 credit agreement   the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2010 credit agreement could limit our future financial flexibility additionally a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the arrangement which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so in this current financial climate or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the credit arrangement the associated debt service costs of this credit arrangement could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital   we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all we believe that our existing cash balances projected cash flow from operations and the borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our plans for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future   however we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings prevailing credit market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations   if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights   we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions   we face risks related to litigation we are and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to settle the claim on reasonable terms our business results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected  9    we face risks related to taxation we operate in numerous domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions changes to the tax laws as well as the level of operations and profitability in each jurisdiction may have an unfavorable impact upon the amount of taxes that we recognize in any given year in addition our tax filings for various tax years are subject to audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business and in the ordinary course of business we may be under audit by one or more tax authorities from time to time these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes and resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts we have recorded additionally the results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made   our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations we operate in a number of countries and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations as a result we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however if any employee fails to comply with or intentionally disregards any of these laws or regulations a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a material impact on our business   risks related to our common stock    our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors or guidance we have given which may cause the price of our common stock to decline our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing

international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future or guidance we have given if this occurs the price of our stock would likely decline   our stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid the trading prices of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts expectations for any quarterly period as well as other factors outside of our control these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock   future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market   as of december 31

our common stock   interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours to our knowledge as of december 31 2012 and based upon publiclyavailable sec filings four institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholders   10    our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include       the ability of our board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock        advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings and        the antitakeover provisions of delaware law     these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock   item 1b unresolved staff comments    the

were also clients a year ago by all clients from a year ago             wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelvemonth period wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients who were clients one year earlier by the total contract value from a year earlier excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange when wallet retention exceeds client retention it is an indication of retention of higherspending clients or increased spending by retained clients or both         consulting   consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from inprocess consulting measurement and strategic advisory services engagements             utilization rate represents a measure of productivity of our consultants utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill             billing rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours             average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of

that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs   the companys 2010 credit agreement expires in december 2015 the company is currently exploring refinancing options to take advantage of favorable market conditions  15    fluctuations in quarterly results   our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter as well as other events the timing and amount of new business generated the mix between domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of our new products and services competition in the industry general economic conditions and other factors which are beyond our control the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows   critical accounting policies and estimates   the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below   the preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the companys financial statements in future periods   our critical accounting policies are as follows   revenue recognition  revenue is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 101 and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition sab 104 revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows    research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products and are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term fees from research reprints are recognized when the reprint is shipped    consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered andor services are provided revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment    events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium conference or exhibition   the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim   uncollectible fees receivable  we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts   the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands        december 31      2012   2011              total fees receivable  470368   428293   allowance for losses   6400   7260  fees receivable net  463968   421033    16    goodwill and other intangible assets  the company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed on a periodic basis should events or circumstances indicate potential impairment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is less than its related carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge against earnings among the factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review are the following    significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results    significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business    significant negative industry or general economic trends    significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and    our market capitalization relative to net book value   the annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill can be based on either a qualitative or qualitative assessment or a combination of the two both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty in 2012 we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test utilizing a qualitative approach based on this assessment the company believes the fair values of the companys reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts see note 1  business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion   accounting for income taxes  as we prepare our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question we consider the availability of loss carryforwards existing deferred tax liabilities future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment is made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the period such determination is made   accounting for stockbased compensation  the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 sab no 107 and no 110 sab no 110 the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 8  stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stockbased compensation   determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the companys common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the companys stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period   restructuring and other accruals  we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved   we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end  17    results of operations   consolidated

product development cos expense increased 8 in 2012 or 503 million to 6591 million compared to 6088 million in 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount as we continued to invest to support the growth in our business and to a lesser extent merit salary increases we also had higher conference costs and related travel expenses due to an increase in the number of events as well as additional attendees and exhibitors at our events these additional costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency cos as a percentage of revenues was 41 for both periods   selling general and administrative sgampa expense increased by 651 million in 2012 or 11 to 6788 million compared to 6137 million in 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact the higher payroll and benefit cost was primarily driven by our

as well as higher sgampa expenses as discussed above   interest expense net declined by 11 in 2012 when compared to 2011 the decline was primarily due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding which declined to 2070 million in 2012 from 2200 million in 2011 as well as lower amortization of capitalized debt refinancing costs   other expense net was 13 million in 2012 and 19 million in 2011

296 for 2012 compared to 323 for 2011 the lower effective tax rate in 2012 was primarily attributable to the recognition of tax benefits in 2012 resulting from the settlement of tax audits as well as

activities for 2012 we had operating cash flow of 2798 million which was the highest in the companys history and an increase of 9 over 2011 our operating cash flow has been continuously enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscriptionbased business model as well as our focus on operational efficiencies revenues in our research segment which increased 12 in 2012 compared to 2011 constituted 70 and 69 of our total revenues in 2012 and 2011 respectively our research contracts generally renew annually and typically are paid in advance and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins has generally resulted in strong growth in operating cash flow each year our cash flow generation has also been enhanced by our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as the effective management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume   in addition to the strong increase in our operating cash flows we also had almost 3000 million of cash and cash equivalents at yearend 2012 which was the highest cash balance in the companys history and 3470 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at yearend 2012 we believe that our strong operating cash flow as well as our existing cash balances and our available borrowing capacity provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs   the companys 2010 credit agreement expires in december 2015 the company is currently exploring refinancing options to take advantage of favorable market conditions   our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world at december 31 2012 approximately 1670 million of our cash was held outside the us approximately half of the amount of cash held overseas represents unremitted earnings of our nonus subsidiaries under us accounting rules no provision for us federal and local taxes is required for these unremitted overseas earnings if the company intends to reinvest such funds overseas our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our us operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our us operations and as a result we intend to reinvest these earnings in our nonus operations except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would

120181   22558     2012 versus 2011   operating   operating cash flow increased by 9 or 242 million in 2012 compared to 2011 which was primarily due to higher net income we also had lower cash payments for interest on our debt and other items as well as higher cash reimbursements related to the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility these increased cash flows were partially offset by higher cash payments for income taxes during 2012   investing   cash used for investing purposes was 547 million in 2012 an increase in cash used of 127 million compared to 2011 due to 103 million of cash used for the acquisition of ideas international and higher capital expenditures   capital expenditures were 443 million in 2012 compared to 420 million in 2011 which included 170 million and 95 million respectively which we paid for the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility up to 250 million of these expenditures are reimbursable by the facility landlord and 130 million was reimbursed in 2012 and 90 million in 2011 the reimbursements are included in operating cash flows   financing   we used 1140 million less cash in our financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a lower number of shares repurchased cash used for share repurchases was 1113 million in 2012 compared to 2120 million in 2011 with 27 million and 59 million of shares repurchased respectively cash used also declined due to net debt activity as we borrowed an additional 50 million in 2012 compared to 201 million of debt repayments in 2011   2011 versus 2010   operating   operating cash flow increased by 24 or 501 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase was primarily due to 406 million in higher net income and lower cash payments for acquisition costs severance and other costs we also received 90 million in landlord cash reimbursements for capital expenditures on the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility these increased cash flows were partially offset by higher cash bonus and commission payments we paid in 2011 due to our stronger financial performance   investing   we used 81 million of additional cash in our investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher capital expenditures capital expenditures were 420 million in 2011 compared to 217 million in 2010 we also made 122 million in payments related to the acquisition of burton group in early 2010 which we acquired in december 2009 the 420 million of capital expenditures in the 2011 period included 95 million we paid for the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility which is fully reimbursable by the landlord the company received reimbursement of 90 million of this amount in 2011   financing   we used an additional 150 million of cash in our financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to additional share repurchases during 2011 we used 2120 million for share repurchases compared to 998 million in 2010 the increase in cash used for share repurchases in 2011 was substantially offset by lower debt repayments in 2011 compared to 2010 on a net basis we repaid 998 million of debt in 2010 and we paid 48 million in fees related to our refinancing compared to 201 million of debt repayments in 2011  24    obligations and commitments   at december 31 2012 we had 2000 million outstanding under our 2010 credit agreement which provides for a fiveyear 2000 million term loan and a 4000 million revolving credit facility the 2010 credit agreement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving credit facility may be increased at the companys option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 1500 million in the aggregate the term loan will be repaid in 19 consecutive quarterly installments with the final payment due in december 2015 and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at the companys option the revolving credit facility may be used for loans and up to 400 million may be used for letters of credit the revolving loans may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed until december 2015 at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid see note 5  debt in the notes to the consolidated

company borrowed in december 2012 under a state of connecticut economic development program which has a 10 year maturity and is included in the due in more than 5 years category         interest payments on amounts outstanding under the 2010 credit facility are based on a floating rate however the company has a 2000 million notional interest rate swap that converts the variable interest payments on the debt to a 226 fixed rate on the first 2000 million of borrowings as a result in order to calculate an estimate for the future interest payments the company has used a rate of 376 which includes the swap rate of 226 plus a loan margin of 150 for the 2010 credit facility       2 the company leases various facilities furniture autos and computer equipment these leases expire between 2013 and 2027 see note 1  business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information       3 represents the companys liability to

become effective these new rules are described below together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods   other comprehensive income reclassifications in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income the standard requires that public companies present information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in their financial statements in a single note or on the face of the financial statements public companies will also have to provide this information in both their annual and interim financial statements the new requirements will take effect for gartner beginning january 1 2013 and will be applied prospectively 	while the company has not completed its analysis of the new standard it believes the new rule may result in additional disclosures and changes to the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income   balance sheet offsetting in december 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201111 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities the new guidance requires disclosures about assets and liabilities that are offset or have the potential to be offset under us gaap rules the new disclosure requirements mandate that entities disclose both gross and net information about financial instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement in addition the standard requires disclosure of collateral received and posted in connection with master netting agreements or similar arrangements these disclosures are intended to address differences in the asset and liability offsetting requirements under us gaap and international financial reporting standards this new guidance will be effective for gartner for interim and annual reporting periods beginning january 1 2013 with retrospective application required while the adoption of this new guidance may result in additional disclosures we do not expect it to have an impact on the companys consolidated balance sheets   the fasb also continues to work on a number of significant accounting rules which may impact the companys accounting and disclosures in future periods since these rules have not yet been issued the effective dates and potential impact are unknown   item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   interest rate risk   we have exposure to changes in interest rates arising from borrowings under our 2010 credit agreement at december 31 2012 we had 1500 million outstanding under the term loan and 500 million outstanding under the revolver borrowings under this facility are floating rate which may be either primebased or eurodollarbased the rate paid for these borrowings includes a base floating rate plus a margin between 050 and 125 on prime borrowings and between 150 and 225 on eurodollarbased borrowings   we have an interest rate swap contract which effectively converts the floating base rate on the first 2000 million of our borrowings to a 226 fixed rate the company only hedges the base interest rate risk on the first 2000 million of its outstanding borrowings accordingly we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings in excess of 2000 million a 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates could change pretax annual interest expense on the additional revolver borrowing capacity under the 2010 credit agreement not including the expansion feature by approximately 09 million  26    foreign currency risk   approximately 46 of our revenues for both the fiscal years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 were derived from sales outside of the us as a result we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the eurodollar the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar our foreign currency exposure results in both translation risk and transaction risk   translation risk   we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency translation risk arises since the assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and these exchange rates fluctuate over time these foreign currency translation adjustments are deferred and are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and do not impact our operating results   a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our condensed consolidated balance sheets can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2012 we had almost 3000 million of cash and cash equivalents with approximately half denominated in foreign currencies if the foreign exchange rates of the major currencies in which we operate changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2012 would have increased or decreased by approximately 120 million   because our foreign subsidiaries generally operate in a local functional currency that differs from the us dollar revenues and expenses in these foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar continuously weakens or strengthens against these other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations historically this impact on our consolidated earnings has not been material since foreign currency movements in the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally   transaction risk   we also have foreign exchange transaction risk since foreign subsidiaries typically enter into transactions in the normal course of business that are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the local functional currency in which the foreign subsidiary operates we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of foreign currency transaction risk these contracts are normally short term in duration and unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized in current period earnings at december 31 2012 we had 68 outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional amount of 761 million and an immaterial net unrealized gain all of these contracts matured by the end of january 2013   credit risk   financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and interest rate swap contracts the majority of the companys cash and cash equivalents and its interest rate swap contracts are with large investment grade commercial banks that are participants in the companys 2010 credit agreement accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion   item 8 financial statements and supplementary data   our consolidated financial

the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty   the company conducted a qualitative assessment of the fair value of its three reporting units as of september 30

recoverable such evaluation may be based on a number of factors including current and projected operating results and cash flows changes in managements strategic direction as well as external economic and market factors the companys policy regarding longlived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill is to evaluate the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the balance can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows should events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future operating cash flows an impairment loss would be recognized the  43    amount of impairment if any is measured based on the difference between projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting

comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements the company has presented net income other comprehensive income and its components and comprehensive income in a new separate statement called the consolidated statements of comprehensive income which is included herein while the companys presentation of comprehensive income has changed there were no changes to the components or amounts that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under existing accounting guidance as a result the adoption of this new rule did not impact the

updates asu no 201105 the standard requires that public companies present information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in their financial statements in a

disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities the new guidance requires disclosures about assets and liabilities that are offset or have the potential to be offset under us gaap rules these

that entities disclose both gross and net information about financial instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement in addition the standard requires disclosure of collateral received and posted in connection with master netting agreements or similar arrangements however as of yearend 2012 the fasb is considering certain amendments to asu no 201111 which may limit the scope of the new rules asu no 201111 will be effective for gartner for interim

accelerated pretax charges included 33 million for deferred losses on interest rate swap contracts that had been recorded in other comprehensive income oci since the swaps had previously been designated as accounting hedges and 04 million for the writeoff of a portion of capitalized debt issuance costs related to the previous debt in accordance with fasb asc topic 815 the deferral of the unrealized losses on the swaps recorded in oci was no longer permitted since the forecasted interest payments related to the previous debt would not occur both the capitalized debt issuance writeoff

we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters after considering amounts already accrued and insurance coverage will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in future periods   indemnifications the company has various agreements that may obligate us to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters generally these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold and licensed or certain intellectual property rights it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of the companys obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements

servicebased and performancebased restricted stock units and common stock equivalents at december 31 2012 the company had 64 million shares of common stock available for awards of stockbased compensation under its 2003 longterm incentive plan   the company accounts for stockbased compensation awards in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 sab no 107 and no 110 sab no 110 stockbased compensation expense is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant which is then recognized as expense over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures the service period is the period over which the related service is performed which is generally the same as the vesting period currently the company issues treasury shares upon the exercise release or settlement of stockbased compensation awards   determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stockbased compensation awards and the common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the amount of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the companys stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stockbased compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period   the company recognized the following amounts of stockbased compensation expense by award type for the years ended december 31 in millions     award

companys weightedaverage estimate of the period of time the sars are expected to be outstanding that is the period between the service inception date and the expected exercise date beginning january 1 2012 the expected life has been calculated based on the companys historical exercise data previously the company determined the expected life based on a simplified calculation permitted by sec sab no 107 and sab no 110 since the necessary historical exercise data was not available the change in methodology had an insignificant impact on the calculation of the expected life    restricted stock

members the 03 million performancebased rsus awarded to executive personnel represented the target amount of the rsu award for the year which was tied to an increase in the companys subscriptionbased research contract value cv for 2012 the final number of performancebased rsus granted could range from 0 to 200 of the target amount with the final amount dependent on the actual increase in cv for the year as measured on december 31 2012 the actual cv increase achieved for 2012 was 1043 of the targeted amount which resulted in the grant of 03 million performancebased rsus to executives    2the

new york stock exchange at the end of each offering period at december 31 2012 the company had approximately 13 million shares available for purchase under the esp plan the esp plan is considered

companys stamford headquarters facility   as of december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 176 million and 183 million respectively the decrease is primarily attributable to reductions for tax positions of prior years and settlements resulting from closure of tax audits partially offset by additions in unrecognized tax benefits attributable to 2012 it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits will be decreased by 45 million within the next 12 months due to anticipated closure of audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitation the unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to the utilization of certain tax attributes   the company classifies uncertain tax positions not expected to be settled within

which is open for tax years 2003 and forward major taxing jurisdictions include the us federal and state the united kingdom canada japan india and ireland   during 2012 the company closed the internal revenue service irs audit of its 2007 federal income tax return the resolution of the audit did not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations of the company   in 2011 the irs commenced an audit of the companys federal income tax returns for the 2008 and 2009 tax years the irs has proposed adjustments for both 2008 and 2009 and the company expects to settle the audit in early 2013 although the audit has not been fully resolved the company believes that the ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations   earnings of nonus subsidiaries are generally subject to us taxation when repatriated the company intends to reinvest these earnings outside the us except in instances where repatriating such earnings would result in minimal additional tax the company currently has no plan to remit earnings which will result in a material tax cost accordingly the company has not recognized additional tax expense that may result from the remittance of such earnings the accumulated undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries approximated 850 million as of december 31 2012 an estimate of the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not indefinitely invested is 170 million   11  derivatives and

business that are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the local functional currency the company enters into shortterm foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the economic effects of these foreign currency transaction risks these contracts are accounted for at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in other income expense net since the company does not designate these contracts as hedges for accounting purposes all of the outstanding contracts at december 31 2012 matured by the end of february 2013      3see note 12  fair value

nature the company believes the carrying amounts of these financial instruments reasonably approximates their fair value due to their shortterm nature the companys financial instruments also includes borrowings outstanding under its 2010 credit agreement and at december 31 2012 the company had 2000 million of floating rate debt outstanding under this arrangement which is carried at amortized cost the company believes the carrying amount of the outstanding borrowings reasonably approximates fair value since the rate of interest on the borrowings reflect current market rates of interest for similar instruments with comparable maturities   fasb asc topic 820 provides a framework for the measurement of fair value and a valuation hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs used in the valuation of assets and liabilities classification within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the resulting fair value measurement the valuation hierarchy contains three levels level 1 measurements consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 measurements include significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves and other marketcorroborated inputs level 3 measurements include significant unobservable inputs such as internallycreated valuation models the company does not currently utilize level 3 valuation inputs to remeasure any of its assets or liabilities however level 3 inputs may be used by the company in its required annual impairment review of goodwill information regarding the periodic assessment of the companys goodwill is included in note 1  business and significant accounting policies   on january 1 2012 the company adopted asu no 201104 fair value measurement topic 820 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss which updates fasb asc topic 820 with new requirements these include 1 a prohibition on grouping financial instruments for purposes of determining fair value except when an entity manages market and credit risks on the basis of the entitys net exposure to the group 2 an extension of the prohibition against the use of a blockage factor to all fair value measurements that prohibition currently applies only to financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets and 3 a requirement that for recurring level 3 fair value measurements entities disclose additional quantitative information about unobservable inputs a description of the valuation process used and qualitative details about the sensitivity of the measurements and their potential impact on operating results the company has a limited number of assets and liabilities recorded in its consolidated balance sheets that are remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis and the company does not currently utilize level 3 valuation inputs to remeasure any of its assets or liabilities in addition the company typically does not transfer assets or liabilities between different levels of the fair value hierarchy as a result the adoption of asu no 201104 did not result in any changes to the companys processes for determining fair values or require additional fair value disclosures   56    the companys assets and liabilities that are remeasured to fair value are presented in the following table in thousands     description  fair value

insurance contracts equals their cash surrender value which approximates fair value cash surrender value represents the estimated amount that the company would receive upon termination of the contract the company considers the life insurance contracts to be valued based on a level 2 input and these assets had a fair value of 196 million and 170 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the

quality government and corporate bonds and other investments the assets are primarily valued based on level 1 and level 2 inputs under the fair value hierarchy in fasb asc topic 820 and the company considers the overall portfolio of these assets to be of lowtomedium investment risk for the yearended december 31 2012 the company contributed 64 million to these plans and benefits paid to participants was 07 million while the actual return on plan assets for these plans was effectively zero in 2012 the company projects a future longterm rate of return on these plan assets of 36 which it believes is reasonable based on the composition of the assets and both current and projected market conditions        in addition to the plan assets held with thirdparty trustees the company also maintains a reinsurance asset arrangement with a large international insurance company the reinsurance asset is an asset of the company whose purpose is to provide funding for benefit payments for one of the plans at december 31 2012 the reinsurance asset was carried on the companys consolidated balance sheets at its cash surrender value of 88 million and is classified in other assets the company believes the cash    58        surrender value approximates fair value and is equivalent to a level 2 input under the fasbs fair value framework in asc topic 820       2the funded status  shortfall represents the amount of the projected benefit obligation that the company has not funded with a thirdparty trustee this amount is a liability of the company and is recorded in other liabilities on

recognized as pension expense over approximately 14 years subject to certain limitations set forth in fasb asc topic 715 the impact of this amortization on the periodic pension expense in 2013 will be immaterial for 2012 2011 and 2010 approximately 02 million 01 million and 02 million respectively of deferred actuarial pension gains were reclassified from aoci to pension expense the company considers the impact of the reclassifications for those years to be immaterial   14  segment information   the company manages its business through three reportable segments research consulting and events research consists primarily of subscriptionbased research products access to research inquiry peer networking services and membership programs consulting consists primarily of consulting measurement engagements and strategic advisory services events consists of various symposia conferences and exhibitions   the company evaluates reportable segment performance and allocates resources based on gross contribution margin gross contribution as presented in the table below is defined as operating income excluding certain cos and sgampa expenses depreciation acquisition and integration charges and amortization of intangibles certain bonus and fringe benefit costs included in consolidated cos are not allocated to segment expense the accounting policies used by the reportable segments are the same as those used by the company there are no intersegment revenues   the company earns revenue from clients in many countries other than the united states there is no individual country in which revenues from external clients represent 10 or more of the companys consolidated revenues additionally no single client accounted for 10 or more of total revenue and the loss of a single client in managements opinion would not have a material adverse effect on revenues the company does not identify or allocate assets including capital expenditures by reportable segment accordingly assets are not being reported by segment because the information is not available by segment and is not reviewed in the evaluation of performance or making decisions in the allocation of resources   the
