completed three business acquisitions in 2014 the 2014 acquisitions these include software advice inc which assists customers with software purchases market visio oy a finnish company and former sales agent for gartner research in finland and russia and sircleit inc a provider of cloudbased search technology that identifies subjectmatter experts note 2  acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k provides additional information regarding the 2014 acquisitions the operating results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated and segment operating results beginning on their respective dates of acquisition the results of these businesses were not material to our consolidated or segment results for the year ended december 31 2014  fluctuations in quarterly results our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter as well as other events the timing and amount of new business generated the mix between domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of our new products and services competition in the industry general economic conditions and other factors which are beyond our control the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below the preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the companys financial statements in future periods our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of us gaap and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition sab 104 revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products and are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term fees from research reprints are recognized when the reprint is delivered consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered andor services are provided revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment18events revenues are deferred and then recognized upon the completion of the related symposium conference or exhibitionthe majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim uncollectible fees receivable  we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands  december 31

financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed on a periodic basis should events or circumstances indicate potential impairment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge against earnings among the factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review are the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating resultssignificant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall businesssignificant negative industry or general economic trendssignificant decline in our stock price for a sustained period andour market capitalization relative to net book valuethe annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill can be based on either a quantitative or qualitative assessment or a combination of the two both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty in 2014 we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test utilizing a qualitative approach based on this assessment the company believes the fair values of the companys reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying amounts see note 1  business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion accounting for income taxes  the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we consider the availability of loss carryforwards projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in making this assessment the company recognizes the tax 19benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position accounting for stockbased compensation  the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 sab no 107 and no 110 sab no 110 the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 8  stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stockbased compensation determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the companys common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the companys stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period restructuring and other accruals  we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end20results of operations consolidated results 2014 versus 2013the

included the enactment of certain beneficial legislation in 2013 the release of tax reserves due to audit settlements and increased tax exempt income during 2014 the internal revenue service closed
