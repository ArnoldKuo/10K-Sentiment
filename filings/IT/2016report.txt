premier event for frontline it technical professionals and architects and our digital marketings events are the premier gatherings for senior marketing leaders competition we believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are the following superior it research content  we believe that we create the broadest highestquality and most relevant research coverage of the it industry with offerings for every member of an it organization our research analysis generates unbiased insight that we believe is timely thoughtprovoking and comprehensive and that is known for its high quality independence and objectivityour leading brand name  we have provided critical trusted insight under the gartner name for over 35 yearsour global footprint and established customer base  we have a global presence with clients in over 90 countries on six continents a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside of the usexperienced management team  our management team is composed of it research veterans and experienced industry executives with long tenure at gartner substantial operating leverage in our business model  we have the ability to

are located in 35 countries enabling us to cover all aspects of it on a global basisnotwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly with consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services while we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition increased competition could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures intellectual property our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies software reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights we rely on a

factorswe operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions the following sections discuss many but not all of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance but is not intended to be allinclusive any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additionally risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and negatively affect your investmentrisks related to our businessour operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic conditions our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends in the us and abroad severe downward pressures on global commodity prices and a lower growth rate in china have contributed to a general outlook of weaker economic growth both in the us and abroad in 2016 recent geopolitical events such as the terrorist attacks in france have added to the uncertainty these conditions could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products and services in general in certain geographic regions or in particular industry sectors such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth attract attendees and exhibitors to our events or obtain new clients such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition low barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sourcesthere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or pricewe may not be able to maintain the quality of our existing products and services we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our published data opinions or viewpoints prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner via the internet and mobile applications failure to maintain state of the art electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating resultswe may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain competitive the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis on the it industry as a whole the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to anticipate the needs of our client organizations develop enhance and improve our existing as well as new products and services to address those needs deliver all products and services in a timely userfriendly and state of the art manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of developing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business the results of operations and our financial positiontechnology is rapidly evolving and if we do not continue to develop new product and service offerings in response to these changes our business could suffer disruptive technologies are rapidly changing the environment in which we our clients and our competitors operate we will need to continue to respond to these changes by enhancing our product and service offerings in order 7to maintain our competitive position however we may not be successful in responding to these forces and enhance our products on a timely basis and any enhancements we develop may not adequately address the changing needs of our clients our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner new or enhanced existing offerings that address the changing needs of this constantly evolving marketplace failure to develop products that meet the needs of our clients in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business the results of operations and our financial positionwe depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services could lead to a decrease in our revenues a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted approximately 73 and 72 of our total revenues for 2015 and 2014 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is a challenging costly and often time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affectedour research subscription contracts are typically for twelve months or longer our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the followingdelivering highquality and timely analysis and advice to our clientsunderstanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of our clients andproviding products and services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competitionadditionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research client retention rate was 84 at december 31 2015 and 85 at december 31 2014 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewalswe depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues consulting segment revenues constituted 15 of our total revenues in 2015 and 17 in 2014 consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the followingdelivering consistent highquality consulting services to our clientstailoring our consulting services to the changing needs of our clients andour ability to match the skills and competencies of our consulting staff to the skills required for the fulfillment of existing or potential consulting engagementsany material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition in addition revenue from our contract optimization business can fluctuate significantly from period to period and is not predictable the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be adversely affected by external factors beyond our control the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and suitable venues for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns reductions in government spending geopolitical crises terrorist attacks war weather natural disasters communicable diseases and other occurrences impacting the global regional or national economies the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event we also face the challenge of procuring venues that are sizeable enough at a reasonable cost to accommodate some of our major eventsour sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated we derive significant revenues from research and consulting contracts with the us government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2015 and 2014 approximately 3450 million and 3100 million respectively of our total contracts were attributable to government entities we believe substantially all of the amounts attributable to government entities at december 31 2015 will be filled in 2016 our us government contracts are subject 8to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services additionally our contracts at the state and local levels as well as foreign government contracts are subject to various governmental authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause or penalty termination for convenience similarly contracts with us federal state and local and foreign governments and their respective agencies are subject to increasingly complex bidding procedures compliance requirements and intense competition should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should our government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of consolidated and segment revenueswe may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize our future growth plans as well as the quality of our products and services our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals recent improvements in the us economy have heightened this competition additionally some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any inability to retain key personnel or to hire and train additional qualified personnel to support the evolving needs of clients or the projected growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating resultswe may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name we believe that our gartner brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be adversely impactedour international operations expose us to a variety of operational and other risks which could negatively impact our future revenue and growth we have clients in over 90 countries and a substantial amount of our revenue is earned outside of the us our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agentour business and operations may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically penetrated the economy it is our policy to comply and to require our local partners and those with whom we do business to comply with all applicable anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and uk bribery act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate our business and reputation may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with such lawswe are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates from our international operations revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the us dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations additionally our effective tax rate is increased as the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies which could impact our operating resultsnatural disasters terrorist acts war and other geopolitical events could disrupt our business we operate in numerous us and international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe a major weather event earthquake flood drought volcanic activity disease or other catastrophic natural disaster could significantly disrupt our operations in addition acts of civil unrest failure of critical infrastructure terrorism armed conflict war and abrupt political change as well as responses by various governments and the international community to such acts can have a negative effect on our business such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt or shut down the internet or other critical clientfacing and business processes impede the travel of our personnel and clients dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel and in general harm our ability to conduct normal business operations any of which can negatively impact our financial condition and operating results such events could also impact the timing and budget decisions of our clients which could negatively impact our business privacy concerns could damage our reputation and deter current and potential clients from using our products and services or attending our events concerns relating to global data privacy have the potential to damage our reputation and deter current and 9prospective clients from using our products and services or attending our events in the ordinary course of our business and in accordance with applicable laws we collect personal information i from our employees ii from the users of our products and services including event attendees and iii from prospective clients we collect only basic personal information from our clients and prospects name email address job title and do not as a rule collect sensitive personal information like the social security numbers used in the us while we may collect credit card numbers on a limited basis from some clients to facilitate payment we do not store such numbers even if unfounded concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of this personal information or other data privacy related matters could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results in addition because many of our products and services are webbased the amount of data we store on our servers including personal information has been increasing any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the disclosure of our users personal data could seriously limit the consumption of our products and services and the attendance at our events as well as harm our reputation and brand and therefore our businessin addition while we have been a safe harbor certified company for a number of years and while we have implemented a companywide privacy compliance program regulatory authorities around the world continue to adopt new laws regulations and penalties concerning data privacy most recently the european court of justice invalidated the safe harbor framework between the us and eu countries which thousands of global companies including gartner relied on for the lawful transfer of personal data from the eu to the us and as of the date of this report an agreement regarding a new framework entitled the euus privacy shield has been announced we are closely monitoring developments as the eu and us work to address this issue until there is definitive guidance for us companies impacted by this decision gartner will continue to maintain and rely upon our comprehensive global data privacy compliance program and robust processes to safeguard our associates and clients personal datathe interpretation and application of these laws in the us the eu and elsewhere are often uncertain inconsistent and ever changing it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data privacy practices complying with these various laws as well as the yet to be issued definitive guidance for us companies concerning the transmission of personal data between the eu and us could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our businessinternet and critical internal computer system failures cyberattacks or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely heavily on computer systems to conduct our operations individuals groups and statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our operations our computer systems our employees and our customers they may develop and deploy malicious software to gain access to our networks and attempt to steal confidential information launch distributed denial of service attacks or attempt other coordinated disruptions these threats are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them a cyberattack widespread internet failure or internet access limitations or disruption of our critical information technology systems through denial of service viruses or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial resultswe take steps to secure our management information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers may be vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events our reputation brand financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if as a result of a significant cyber event or other technologyrelated catastrophe our operations are disrupted or shutdown our confidential proprietary information is stolen or disclosed we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer employee or other confidential information we are required to dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs as a result of these occurrenceswe may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites and to deliver our products and services through emerging channels such as mobile applications however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers potentially harming our financial condition and operating results10our outstanding debt obligations could impact our financial condition or future operating results we have a credit arrangement that provides for a fiveyear 4000 million term loan and a 11 billion revolving credit facility the 2014 credit agreement in addition the credit arrangement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving facility may be increased at our option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 5000 million in the aggregate at december 31 2015 we had a total of 8200 million outstanding under the 2014 credit agreementthe affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2014 credit agreement could limit our future financial flexibility additionally a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the 2014 credit agreement which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the credit arrangement the associated debt service costs of this credit arrangement could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capitalwe may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all we believe that our existing cash balances projected cash flow from operations and the borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our plans for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future however we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital including acquisitions if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings or issue debt prevailing credit and debt market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operationsif we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret patent confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rightsour employees are subject to noncompete agreements nonsolicitation agreements and assignment of invention agreements to the extent permitted under applicable law when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our effortswe have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services or otherwise support our growth objectives the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders should we issue stock in the acquisition decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day to day business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitionswe face risks related to litigation we are and in the future may be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits and despite vigorous efforts to defend any such claim can affect our reputation and responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a claim is made against us which we cannot defend or resolve on reasonable terms our business brand and financial results could be materially and adversely affected11we face risks related to taxation we are a global company with operations and clients in over 90 countries a substantial amount of our earnings is generated outside of the us and taxed at rates significantly less than the us statutory federal income tax rate our effective tax rate financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates and conversely lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets andor by changes in tax laws or accounting principles and their interpretation by relevant authoritiesat the present time the united states and other countries where we do business have either changed or are actively considering changes in their tax accounting and other related laws in the united states proposed and other tax law changes particularly those directed at taxing unremitted and future foreign earnings could increase our effective tax rate in 2014 ireland modified its tax residency rules while these changes are not effective until 2021 for many companies with irish resident operations including gartner the new rules could increase our effective tax rate at that future date likewise during 2015 the organization for economic development and cooperation oecd released final reports on various actions items associated with its initiative to prevent base erosion and profit shifting beps the future enactment by various governments of these and future oecd proposals could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business these actual potential and other changes both individually and collectively could materially increase our effective tax rate and negatively impact our financial position results of operations and cash flowsin addition our tax filings for various years are subject to examination by domestic and international taxing authorities and during the ordinary course of business we are under audit by various tax authorities recent and future actions on the part of the oecd and various governments will likely result in increased scrutiny of our tax filings although we believe that our tax filings and related accruals are reasonable the final resolution of tax audits may be materially different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows particularly in major taxing jurisdictions including but not limited to the united states ireland india canada united kingdom japan and france our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations we operate in a number of countries including emerging markets and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations as a result we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however if any employee fails to comply with or intentionally disregards any of these laws regulations or our policies a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a negative impact on our reputation and businessrisks related to our common stock our operating results may fluctuate from period to period andor the financial guidance we have given may not meet the expectations of investors which may cause the price of our common stock to decline our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services competition in our industry and the impact of our acquisitions an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of investors or the financial guidance we have previously provided if this occurs the price of our common stock could decline our stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid the price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions geopolitical events changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts expectations for any quarterly period as well as other factors outside of our control including any and all factors that move the securities markets generally these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock12 future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market at the present time we are executing against a boardapproved share repurchase program to reduce the number of outstanding shares of our common stock at december 31 2015 approximately 11 billion remained available for share purchases under this program no assurance can be given that we will continue these activities in the future when the program is completed or in the event that the price of our common stock reaches levels at which repurchases are not accretivefuture sales of our common stock from grants and awards could lower our stock price as of december 31 2015 the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards under our equity incentive plans was approximately 27 million shares approximately 05 million of which have vested in addition at the present time approximately 70 million shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans shares of common stock issued under these plans are freely transferable and have been registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities act except for any shares held by affiliates as that term is defined in rule 144 under the securities act which are subject to certain limitations we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stockinterests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours to our knowledge as of the date hereof and based upon publiclyavailable sec filings four institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholdersour antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions includethe ability of our board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stockadvance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings andthe antitakeover provisions of delaware lawthese provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stockitem 1b

calculated at an enterprise level which represents a single company or customer     wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelvemonth period wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients who were clients one year ago by the total contract value from a year ago excluding

while 6560 million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit line we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needswe continue to focus on maximizing shareholder value during 2015 we repurchased 62 million of our outstanding common shares and we also acquired nubera ebusiness sl based in barcelona spain nubera and capterra inc based in arlington virginia capterra both of which help organizations find the right business software to meet their needs note 2  acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k provides additional information regarding these acquisitions  fluctuations in quarterly results our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter as well as other events the timing and amount of new business generated the mix between domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of our new products and services competition in the industry acquisitions general economic conditions and other factors which are beyond our control the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results ongoing 19changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements in future periods our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of us gaap as well as sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition sab 104 revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows research revenues are mainly derived from subscription contracts for research products the related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term fees derived from assisting organizations in selecting the right business software for their needs is recognized when the leads are provided to vendors consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered andor services are provided revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their paymentevents revenues are deferred and then recognized upon the completion of the related symposium conference or exhibitionthe majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim uncollectible fees receivable  we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the determination of the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience an assessment of current economic conditions the aging of outstanding receivables the financial health of specific clients and probable losses this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands  december 31 2015 2014total fees receivable587663 558807allowance for losses6900 6700fees receivable net580763 552107goodwill and other intangible assets  the company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic no 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are our current operating results relative to our annual plan or historical performance changes in our strategic plan or use of our assets restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments competitive pressures and changes in the general economy or in the markets in which we operate a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value asc topic no 350 requires an annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill which can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature or a combination of the two both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty if our annual goodwill impairment evaluation determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount we may recognize an impairment charge against earnings among the factors we consider in a qualitative assessment are general economic conditions and the competitive environment actual and projected reporting unit financial performance forwardlooking business measurements and external market assessments a quantitative analysis requires 20management to consider all of the factors relevant to a qualitative assessment as well as the utilization of detailed financial projections to include the rate of revenue growth profitability and cash flows as well as assumptions regarding discount rates the companys weightedaverage cost of capital and other data in order to determine a fair value for our reporting units we conducted a quantitative assessment of the fair value of all of the companys reporting units during the third quarter of 2015 the results of this test determined that the fair values of the companys reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying values see note 1  business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and amortizable intangible assets  accounting for income taxes  the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we consider the availability of loss carryforwards projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in making this assessment the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position accounting for stockbased compensation  the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topic no 505 and 718 and sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 sab no 107 and no 110 sab no 110 the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 8  stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the companys common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the companys stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period restructuring and other accruals  we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until the end of our fiscal year21results of operations consolidated results 2015

cash flow as well as our existing cash balances and our available borrowing capacity under our 2014 credit agreement provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs however should we need to borrow additional amounts we believe we would be able to do so on reasonable terms we had operating cash flow of 3456 million in 2015 in addition we also borrowed an additional 4200 million on a net basis under our 2014 credit agreement during 2015 we used 1962 million in cash to acquire other businesses and we also used 5090 million in cash to repurchase our common shares we currently have a 12 billion board approved authorization to repurchase the companys common stock and as of december 31 2015 approximately 11 billion of this authorization remains  we have historically

continuously strong operating cash flow our cash flow generation has also benefited from our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world at december 31 2015 approximately 3510

yet become effective and that may impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods are described below together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in future periodsbusiness combinationsin september 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201516 business combinations  simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments asu no 201516 asu no 201516 requires the recognition of adjustments to business combination provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined the effects of the adjustments to provisional amounts on depreciation amortization or other income effects should be recognized in currentperiod earnings as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date disclosure of the portion of the adjustment recorded in currentperiod earnings that would have been reported in prior reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized at the acquisition date is also required the rule is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for gartner on january 1 2016 asu no 201516 will not have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements at the date of adoption however asu no 201616 could have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements in the future if a transaction occurs within the scope of the rule debt issuance cost presentation in april 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs which amends the current presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements asu no 201503 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts instead of a deferred asset the amendment is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for 32gartner on january 1 2016 the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements revenue recognitionin may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asu no 201409 asu no 201409 is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by removing inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue recognition requirements providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues improving comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities industries jurisdictions and capital markets and providing more useful information to users of financial statements through improved revenue disclosure requirements asu no 201409 is effective for gartner on january 1 2018 we continue to evaluate the impact of asu no 201409 the fasb also continues to work on a number of significant accounting rules which if issued could materially impact the companys accounting policies and disclosures in future periods however since these rules have not yet been issued the effective dates and potential impact are unknown item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate risk the companys 2014 credit agreement provides for a fiveyear 4000 million term loan and a 11 billion revolving credit facility at december 31 2015 we had 8200 million outstanding under the 2014 credit agreement which included 3800 million outstanding under the term loan and 4400 million under the revolver we have exposure to changes in interest rates arising from borrowings under the 2014 credit agreement since amounts borrowed are based on a floating base rate of interest however we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates through our interest rate swap contracts which effectively convert the floating base interest rate on the first 7000 million of our variable rate borrowings to fixed rates thus we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings only in excess of 7000 million which equaled 1200 million at december 31 2015 as an indication of our exposure to changes in interest rates a hypothetical 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates could have changed our 2015 pretax annual interest expense on the 1200 million of unhedged borrowings at december 31 2015 by approximately 03 millionforeign currency risk for the fiscal years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 approximately 41 and 45 respectively of the companys revenues were derived from sales outside of the us as a result we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar the reporting currency of our financial statements is the us dollar as the values of the foreign currencies in which we operate fluctuate over time relative to the us dollar the company is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risktranslation risk arises as our foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency adjustments resulting from the translation of these assets and liabilities are deferred and recorded as a component of stockholders deficit equity a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2015 approximately half of our 3730 million of cash and cash equivalents was denominated in foreign currencies if the exchange rates of the foreign currencies we hold all changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2015 would have increased or decreased by approximately 190 million the translation of our foreign currency revenues and expenses historically has not had a material impact on our consolidated earnings since movements in and among the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally however our earnings could be impacted during periods of significant exchange rate volatility or when some or all of the major currencies in which we operate move in the same direction against the us dollar transaction risk arises when our foreign subsidiaries enter into transactions that are denominated in a currency that may differ from the local functional currency as these transactions are translated into the local functional currency gain or loss may result which is recorded in current period earnings we typically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of some of this foreign currency transaction risk our outstanding currency contracts as of december 31 2015 had an immaterial net unrealized gain  33credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and interest rate swap contracts the majority of the companys cash and cash equivalents interest rate swap contracts and its foreign exchange contracts are with large investment grade commercial banks accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion item 8 financial statements and supplementary data our consolidated financial statements for 2015 2014 and 2013 together with the reports of kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm are included herein in this annual report on form 10k item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure none item 9a controls and procedures

tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired the evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill is performed in accordance with fasb asc no topic 350 which requires an annual assessment of potential goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 49the required annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature or a combination of the two both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty if our annual goodwill impairment evaluation determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount we may recognize an impairment charge against earnings we conducted a quantitative assessment of the fair value of all of the companys reporting units during the third quarter of 2015 the results of this test determined that the fair values of the companys reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying values the following table presents changes to the carrying amount of goodwill by segment during the twoyear period ended december 31 2015 in thousands research consulting events

included in the research segment impairment of longlived assets the companys longlived assets primarily consist of intangible assets other than goodwill and property equipment and leasehold improvements the company reviews its longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the respective asset may not be recoverable such evaluation may be based on a number of factors including current and projected operating results and cash flows changes in managements strategic direction as well as external economic and market factors the company evaluates the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the balance can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future operating cash flows an impairment loss would be recognized the amount of impairment if any is measured based on the difference between projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the companys average cost of funds and the carrying value of the asset the company did not record any impairment charges for longlived assets during the three year period ended december 31 2015  pension obligations the company has definedbenefit pension plans in several of its international

balance are required to classify deferred taxes as noncurrent assets or noncurrent liabilities the company early adopted the standard on a prospective basis and prior period balance sheets were not retrospectively adjusted the impact of the reclassification of these amounts on the companys december 31 2015 balance sheet was immaterial discontinued operations  the company adopted fasb accounting standards update no 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity on january 1 2015 which changes the criteria for determining which disposal transactions can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements under the new guidance a discontinued operation is defined as a disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results the adoption of the rule did not have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements at adoption however the rule may impact the companys consolidated financial statements in future periods if the company has a discontinued operation recently issued accounting rules the fasb has also issued accounting rules that have not yet become effective and that may impact the companys consolidated financial statements or related disclosures in future periods these rules and their potential impact are discussed below business combinations  in september 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201516 business combinations  simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments asu no 201516 asu no 201516 requires the recognition of adjustments to business combination provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined the effects of the adjustments to provisional amounts on depreciation amortization or other income effects should be recognized in currentperiod earnings as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date disclosure of the portion of the adjustment recorded in currentperiod earnings that would have been reported in prior reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized at the acquisition date is also required the rule is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for gartner on january 1 2016 asu no 201516 will not have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements at the date of adoption however asu no 201616 could have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements in the future if a transaction occurs within the scope of the rule debt issuance cost presentation  in april 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs which amends the current presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements asu no 201503 51requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts instead of a deferred asset the amendment is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for gartner on january 1 2016 the adoption of the new guidance will likely result in some minor presentation changes to the companys consolidated balance sheet and disclosures revenue recognition  in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asu no 201409 asu no 201409 and a related amendment is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by removing inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue recognition requirements providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues improving comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities industries jurisdictions and capital markets and providing more useful information to users of financial statements through improved revenue disclosure requirements asu no 201409 is effective for gartner on january 1 2018 we continue to evaluate the impact of asu no 201409 the fasb also continues to work on a number of significant accounting rules which if issued could materially impact the companys accounting policies and disclosures in future periods however since these rules have not yet been issued the effective dates and potential impact are unknown 2  acquisitionsthe company completed the following business acquisitions during the years ended december 31 2015the

which the related service is performed which is generally the same as the vesting period currently the company issues treasury shares upon the exercise release or settlement of stockbased compensation awards determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stockbased compensation awards and the common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the amount of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent managements best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the companys stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stockbased compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period the company recognized the following amounts of stockbased

significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves and other marketcorroborated inputs level 3 measurements include significant unobservable inputs such as internallycreated valuation models the company does not currently
