value represents the value attributable to all of our subscriptionrelated research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time without regard to the duration of the contract     client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients who were also clients a year ago by all clients from a year ago client retention is calculated at an enterprise level which represents a single company or customer     wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelvemonth period wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients who were clients one year ago by the total contract value from a year ago excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange when wallet retention exceeds client retention it is an indication of retention of higherspending clients or increased spending by retained clients or both wallet retention is calculated at an enterprise level which represents a single company or customer   consulting consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from inprocess consulting measurement and strategic advisory services engagements     utilization rate represents a measure of productivity of our consultants utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill     billing rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours     average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year   events number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period     number of attendees represents the total number of people who attend events 18executive summary of operations and financial position we have executed a consistent growth strategy since 2005 to drive doubledigit annual revenue and earnings growth the fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research content delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings building a strong sales capability providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention and continuously improving our operational effectiveness we had total revenues of 2163 billion in 2015 an increase of 7 over 2014 on a reported basis and 13 adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange diluted earnings per share increased to 206 per share in 2015 from 203 per share in 2014  research revenues rose 10 yearoveryear to 1583 billion in 2015 and the contribution margin was 69 the same as 2014 at december 31 2015 research contract value was 1761 billion an increase of 10 over december 31 2014 on a reported basis and 14 adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange both client and wallet retention remained strong at 84 and 105 respectively at december 31 2015  consulting revenues in 2015 decreased 6 when compared to 2014 but were flat when adjusted for the foreign exchange impact the gross contribution margin was 33 in 2015 compared to 34 in 2014 consultant utilization declined by 2 points in 2015 to 66 we had 606 billable consultants at december 31 2015 compared to 535 at yearend 2014 backlog increased 15 yearoveryear

cash equivalents while 6560 million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit line we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needswe continue to focus on maximizing shareholder value during 2015 we repurchased 62 million of our outstanding common shares and we also acquired nubera ebusiness sl based in barcelona spain nubera and capterra inc based in arlington virginia capterra both of which help organizations find the right business software to meet their needs note 2  acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k provides additional information regarding these acquisitions  fluctuations in quarterly results our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter as well as other events the timing and amount of new business generated the mix between domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of our new products and services competition in the industry acquisitions general economic conditions and other factors which are beyond our control the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results ongoing 19changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements in future periods our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of us gaap as well as sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition sab 104 revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows research revenues are mainly derived from subscription contracts for research products the related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term fees derived from assisting organizations in selecting the right business software for their needs is recognized when the leads are provided to vendors consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered andor services are provided revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their paymentevents revenues are deferred and then recognized upon the completion of the related symposium conference or exhibitionthe majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim uncollectible fees receivable  we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the determination of the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience an assessment of current economic conditions the aging of outstanding receivables the financial health of specific clients and probable losses this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands  december 31 2015 2014total fees receivable587663 558807allowance for losses6900 6700fees receivable net580763 552107goodwill and other intangible assets  the company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic no 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are our current operating results relative to our annual plan or historical performance changes in our strategic plan or use of our assets restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments competitive pressures and changes in the general economy or in the markets in which we operate a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value asc topic no 350 requires an annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill which can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature or a combination of the two both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty if our annual goodwill impairment evaluation determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount we may recognize an impairment charge against earnings among the factors we consider in a qualitative assessment are general economic conditions and the competitive environment actual and projected reporting unit financial performance forwardlooking business measurements and external market assessments a quantitative analysis requires 20management to consider all of the factors relevant to a qualitative assessment as well as the utilization of detailed financial projections to include the rate of revenue growth profitability and cash flows as well as assumptions regarding discount rates the companys weightedaverage cost of capital and other data in order to determine a fair value for our reporting units we conducted a quantitative assessment of the fair value of all of the companys reporting units during the third quarter of 2015 the results of this test determined that the fair values of the companys reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying values see note 1  business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and amortizable intangible assets  accounting for income taxes  the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we consider the availability of loss carryforwards projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in making this assessment the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position accounting for stockbased compensation  the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topic no 505 and 718 and sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 sab no 107 and no 110 sab no 110 the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 8  stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the companys common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the companys stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period restructuring and other accruals  we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until the end of our fiscal year21results of operations consolidated results 2015

recognized additional income tax expense that could result from the remittance of these earnings however should our liquidity needs change or we decide to repatriate some or all of these unremitted
