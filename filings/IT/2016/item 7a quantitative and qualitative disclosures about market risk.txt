interest rate risk the companys 2014 credit agreement provides for a fiveyear 4000 million term loan and a 11 billion revolving credit facility at december 31 2015 we had 8200 million outstanding under the 2014 credit agreement which included 3800 million outstanding under the term loan and 4400 million under the revolver we have exposure to changes in interest rates arising from borrowings under the 2014 credit agreement since amounts borrowed are based on a floating base rate of interest however we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates through our interest rate swap contracts which effectively convert the floating base interest rate on the first 7000 million of our variable rate borrowings to fixed rates thus we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings only in excess of 7000 million which equaled 1200 million at december 31 2015 as an indication of our exposure to changes in interest rates a hypothetical 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates could have changed our 2015 pretax annual interest expense on the 1200 million of unhedged borrowings at december 31 2015 by approximately 03 millionforeign currency risk for the fiscal years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 approximately 41 and 45 respectively of the companys revenues were derived from sales outside of the us as a result we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar the reporting currency of our financial statements is the us dollar as the values of the foreign currencies in which we operate fluctuate over time relative to the us dollar the company is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risktranslation risk arises as our foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency adjustments resulting from the translation of these assets and liabilities are deferred and recorded as a component of stockholders deficit equity a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2015 approximately half of our 3730 million of cash and cash equivalents was denominated in foreign currencies if the exchange rates of the foreign currencies we hold all changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2015 would have increased or decreased by approximately 190 million the translation of our foreign currency revenues and expenses historically has not had a material impact on our consolidated earnings since movements in and among the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally however our earnings could be impacted during periods of significant exchange rate volatility or when some or all of the major currencies in which we operate move in the same direction against the us dollar transaction risk arises when our foreign subsidiaries enter into transactions that are denominated in a currency that may differ from the local functional currency as these transactions are translated into the local functional currency gain or loss may result which is recorded in current period earnings we typically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of some of this foreign currency transaction risk our outstanding currency contracts as of december 31 2015 had an immaterial net unrealized gain  33credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and interest rate swap contracts the majority of the companys cash and cash equivalents interest rate swap contracts and its foreign exchange contracts are with large investment grade commercial banks accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion
