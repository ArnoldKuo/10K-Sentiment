principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are the following superior it research content  we believe that we create the broadest highestquality and most relevant research coverage

1475 research analysts and consultants located around the world our analysts collectively speak 47 languages and are located in 26 countries enabling us to cover all aspects of it on a global basisnotwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly with consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services while we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition increased competition could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures intellectual property our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies software reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights we have policies related to confidentiality ownership and the use and protection of gartners

and governancenominating item 1a risk factors we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions the following sections discuss many but not all of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance but is not intended to be allinclusive any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additionally risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and negatively affect your investment risks related to our business our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic conditions our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends in the us and abroad economic growth continues to be both weak and uneven in many parts of the world in addition problems continue with government deficit spending in the us and other countries ongoing uncertainty in global trade and high levels of sovereign debt these conditions could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products and services such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth attract attendees and exhibitors to our events or obtain new clients such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price we may not be able to maintain our existing products and services we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain competitive the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for 6information and analysis on the it industry as a whole the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to anticipate the needs of our client organizations enhance and improve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services deliver all products and services in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or services releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position we depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services could lead to a decrease in our revenues a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted 71 and 70 of our revenues for 2013 and 2012 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is often a time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affectedour research subscription agreements are generally for twelve months although we do enter into multiyear agreements in certain circumstances our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following delivering highquality and timely analysis and advice to our clientsunderstanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of our clients anddelivering products and services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competitionadditionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research client retention rate was 82 at december 31 2013 and 83 at december 31 2012 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues consulting segment revenues constituted 18 of our total revenues in 2013 and 19 in 2012 consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following delivering consistent highquality consulting services to our clientstailoring our consulting services to the changing needs of our clients andour ability to match the skills and competencies of our consulting staff to the skills required for the fulfillment of existing or potential consulting engagementsany material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be adversely affected by external factors beyond our control the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and locations for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns reductions in government spending terrorist attacks weather natural disasters and other occurrences impacting the global regional or national economy the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event additionally a significant recovery in the global economy could make our ability to procure space for our events and efforts to keep associated costs down more challenging our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated we derive significant revenues from contracts with the us government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 2830 million and 2550 million 7respectively of our research contract value and consulting backlog was attributable to governments we believe substantially all of the amount attributable to governments at december 31 2013 will be filled in 2014 our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services additionally our contracts at the state and local levels as well as foreign government contracts are subject to various governmental authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause or penalty termination for convenience similarly contracts with domestic and foreign governments and their agencies are subject to increasingly complex bidding procedures and intense competition should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of segment and consolidated revenues we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our products and services our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name we believe that our gartner brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be adversely impacted our international operations expose us to a variety of operational risks which could negatively impact our future revenue and growth we have clients in 85 countries and a substantial amount of our revenues is earned outside of the us our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations differences between us and foreign tax rates and laws and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent our international operations expose us to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the us dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations natural disasters or geopolitical events may disrupt our business a major weather event terrorist attack earthquake flood volcanic activity or other catastrophic disaster could significantly disrupt our operations such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing and business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel our corporate headquarters is located approximately 30 miles from new york city and we have an operations center located in ft myers florida a hurricaneprone area we also operate in numerous international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries and regions which may negatively impact our sales and increase our operating costs additionally these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget decisions of our clients such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition and operating results internet and critical internal computer system failures cyberattacks or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely heavily on computer systems a cyberattack widespread internet failure or disruption of our critical information technology systems through viruses or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions such events could 8significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition and operating results we take steps generally acknowledged as standard for the industry to secure our management information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers may be vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events our reputation brand financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if as a result of a significant cyber event or other technologyrelated catastrophe our operations are disrupted or shutdown our confidential proprietary information is stolen or disclosed we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer employee or other confidential information we are required to dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs as a result of these occurrences we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers potentially harming our financial condition and operating resultsour outstanding debt obligation could impact our financial condition or future operating results we have a credit arrangement that provides for a fiveyear 1500 million term loan and a 6000 million revolving credit facility the 2013 credit agreement the credit arrangement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving facility may be increased at our option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 2500 million in the aggregate at december 31 2013 we had a total of 2000 million outstanding under the 2013 credit agreement the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2013 credit agreement could limit our future financial flexibility additionally a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the arrangement which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so in this current financial climate or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the credit arrangement the associated debt service costs of this credit arrangement could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all we believe that our existing cash balances projected cash flow from operations and the borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our plans for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future however we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings prevailing credit market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights9 we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions we face risks related to litigation we are and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits any such claim can affect our reputation and responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to settle the claim on reasonable terms our business brand results of operations or financial position could be materially and adversely affectedwe face risks related to taxation we operate in numerous jurisdictions around the world the company recognizes tax expense based upon the applicable tax rates and tax laws of the countries where income is generated a substantial amount of our income is generated outside of the us and is taxed at rates significantly less than the us statutory income tax rate of 35 the us and many other countries in which the company operates are considering proposals which may significantly change the taxation of income earned outside of the us our future effective tax rate financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in law or if more of our income is earned in higher taxing jurisdictions and less is earned in lower taxing jurisdictions in addition our tax filings for various years are subject to examination by taxing authorities and during the ordinary course of business we are under audit by one or more tax authorities although we believe that our tax filings are reasonable the final resolution of tax audits may be different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations we operate in a number of countries and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations as a result we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however if any employee fails to comply with or intentionally disregards any of these laws or regulations a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a material impact on our business risks related to our common stock our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors or guidance we have given which may cause the price of our common stock to decline our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future or guidance we have given if this occurs the price of our

analysts expectations for any quarterly period as well as other factors outside of our control these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common

defined in rule 144 under the securities act we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours to our knowledge as of december 31 2013 and based upon publiclyavailable sec filings five institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholdersour antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stockadvance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings andthe antitakeover provisions of delaware lawthese provisions could discourage

important performance indicators for our business segments business segment business measurementsresearch contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscriptionrelated research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time without regard to the duration of the contract     client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients who were also clients a year ago by all clients from a year ago     wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelvemonth period wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients who were clients one year earlier by the total contract value from a year earlier excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange when wallet retention exceeds client retention it is an indication of retention of higherspending clients or increased spending by retained clients or both   consulting consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from inprocess consulting measurement and strategic advisory services engagements     utilization rate represents a measure of productivity of our consultants utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill     billing rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours     average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year   events number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period     number of attendees represents the total number of people who attend events executive summary of operations and financial position we have executed a consistent growth strategy since 2005 to drive doubledigit annual revenue and earnings growth the fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research content delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings building a strong sales capability providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention and continuously improving our operational effectiveness we had total revenues of 17842 million in 2013 an increase of 10 over 2012 while diluted earnings per share increased by 20 per share to 193 excluding the impact of foreign currency 2013 total revenues increased 11 over 2012 research revenues rose 12 yearoveryear to 12710 million in 2013

utilization was 64 for 2013 compared to 67 in 2012 and we had 509 billable consultants at december 31 2013 compared to 503 at yearend 2012 backlog increased 3 yearoveryear to 1061 million at december

attendees for a more detailed discussion of our results see the segment results section below cash flow from our operating activities increased 13 in 2013 compared to 2012 to 3157 million we continued to focus on maximizing shareholder value in 2013 and we repurchased 34 million of our outstanding common shares during the year we ended 2013 with almost 4240 million in cash and cash equivalents which is a record yearend cash balance we refinanced our debt in 2013 to take advantage of favorable market conditions and as of yearend 2013 we had over 5410 million of borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs fluctuations in quarterly results our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter as well as other events the timing and amount of new business generated the mix between domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of our new products and services competition in the industry general economic conditions and other factors which are beyond our control the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below the preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the companys financial statements in future periods our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  revenue is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 101 and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition sab 104 revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products and are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term fees from research reprints are recognized when the reprint is shippedconsulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered andor services are provided revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their paymentevents revenues are deferred and then recognized upon the completion of the related symposium conference or exhibitionthe majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal 17funding clauses it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim uncollectible fees receivable  we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands december 31 2013 2012total fees receivable497923

fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed on a periodic basis should events or circumstances indicate potential impairment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is less than its related carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge against earnings among the factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review are the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating resultssignificant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall businesssignificant negative industry or general economic trendssignificant decline in our stock price for a sustained period andour market capitalization relative to net book valuethe annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill can be based on either a qualitative or qualitative assessment or a combination of the two both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty in 2013 we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test utilizing a qualitative approach based on this assessment the company believes the fair values of the companys reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts see note 1  business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion accounting for income taxes  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question we consider the availability of loss carryforwards existing deferred tax liabilities future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment is made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the period such determination is made 18accounting for stockbased compensation  the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 sab no 107 and no 110 sab no 110 the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 8  stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stockbased compensation determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the companys common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the companys stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period restructuring and other accruals  we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end19results of operations consolidated results 2013 versus 2012the following table presents the changes in selected line items

by segment 20cost of services and product development cos expense increased 8 in 2013 compared to 2012 or 544 million to 7135 million compared to 6591 million in 2012 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount as we continued to invest to support the growth in our business and to a lesser extent merit salary increases we also had higher conference costs due to an increase in the number of events a doubledigit increase in the number of exhibitors at our events and the upgrading of facilities in several locations to support anticipated growth in the events business these additional costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency cos as a percentage of revenues was 40 in the 2013 period compared to 41 in the 2012 period  selling general and administrative sgampa expense increased by 816 million in 2013 or 12 to 7605 million compared to 6788 million in 2012 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact the higher payroll and benefit cost was primarily driven by our investment in additional headcount and to a lesser extent higher sales commissions and merit salary increases the increased headcount includes additional quotabearing sales associates which increased to 1643 at december 31 2013 a 16 increase over yearend 2012 depreciation expense increased 14 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to additional depreciation on leasehold improvements from two renovated buildings on our stamford

ideas international acquisition in mid2012 acquisition and integration charges was 03 million in 2013 compared to 24 million in 2012 these charges related to the acquisition of ideas international in mid2012 and include legal consulting severance and other costs operating income increased 298 million yearoveryear or 12 to 2755 million in 2013 from 2457 million in 2012 the increased operating

change in the annual mix of pretax income by jurisdiction as well as the impact of certain state tax credits recognized in 2012 during 2013 the company closed the internal revenue service irs audit of its 2008 and 2009 federal income tax returns the resolution of the audit did not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations of the

results by segment cost of services and product development cos expense increased 8 in 2012 or 503 million to 6591 million compared to 6088 million in 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount as we continued to invest to support the growth in our business and to a lesser extent merit salary increases 22we also had higher conference costs and related travel expenses due to an increase in the number of events as well as additional attendees and exhibitors at our events these additional costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency cos as a percentage of revenues was 41 for both periods selling general and administrative sgampa expense increased by 651 million in 2012 or 11 to 6788 million compared to 6137 million in 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact the higher payroll and benefit cost was primarily driven by our investment in additional headcount and to a lesser extent higher sales commissions and merit salary increases the increased headcount includes additional quotabearing sales associates which increased to 1417 at december 31 2012 a 12 increase over the prior yearend depreciation expense decreased slightly yearoveryear due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated which was only partially offset by the additional depreciation related to asset additions capital expenditures increased to 443 million in 2012 from 420 million in 2011 which includes 170 million and 95 million respectively of expenditures for the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility up to 250 million of these expenditures are reimbursable by the facility landlord and as of december 31 2012 220 million had been reimbursed amortization of intangibles decreased yearoveryear due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized which was only partially offset by the additional amortization from the intangible assets recorded from the ideas international acquisition in mid2012 acquisition and integration charges was 24 million in 2012 and zero in 2011 these charges related to the acquisition of ideas international in mid2012 and included legal consulting severance and other costs operating income increased 316 million yearoveryear or 15 to 2457 million in 2012 from 2141 million in 2011 operating income as a percentage of revenues was 15 for both periods although both research and events had higher segment contributions in 2012 these increases were partially offset by a lower contribution in consulting as well as higher sgampa expenses as discussed above interest expense net declined by 11 in 2012 when compared to 2011 the decline was primarily due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding which declined to 2070 million in 2012 from 2200 million in 2011 as well as lower amortization of capitalized debt refinancing costs other expense net was 13 million in 2012 and 19 million in 2011 these expenses primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses provision for income taxes was 697 million in 2012 compared to 653 million in 2011 and the effective tax rate was 296 for 2012 compared to 323 for 2011 the lower effective tax rate in 2012 was primarily attributable to the recognition of tax benefits in 2012 resulting from the settlement of tax audits as well as benefits recorded in 2012 relating to the recognition of certain state tax credits during 2012 the company closed the irs audit of its 2007 federal income tax return the resolution of the audit did not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations of the company net income was 1659 million in 2012 and 1369 million in 2011 an increase of 290 million or 21 primarily due to a higher operating income which was partially offset by 44 million in higher income tax charges although the yearoveryear effective tax rate declined pretax income increased substantially resulting in the higher dollar amount of tax charges both basic and diluted earnings per share increased 24

revenue and the higher contribution margin in 2012 were primarily due to the significantly higher exhibitor volume at our ongoing events  26liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations primarily through cash generated from our operating activities for 2013 we had operating cash flow of 3157 million which was the highest in the companys history and represented an increase of 13 over 2012 our operating cash flow has been continuously enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscriptionbased business model as well as our focus on operational efficiencies revenues in our research segment which increased 12 in 2013 compared to 2012 constituted 71 and 70 of our total revenues in 2013 and 2012 respectively our research contracts generally renew annually and typically are paid in advance and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins has generally resulted in strong growth in operating cash flow each year our cash flow generation has also benefited from our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume in addition to the strong increase in our operating cash flows we also had almost 4240 million of cash and cash equivalents at yearend 2013 which was the highest cash balance in the companys history we refinanced our debt in 2013 to take advantage of favorable market conditions and we had 5411 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at yearend 2013 we believe that our strong operating cash flow as well as our existing cash balances and our available borrowing capacity provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world at december 31 2013 2470 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the us approximately half of the cash and cash equivalents held overseas represents unremitted earnings of our nonus subsidiaries under us accounting rules no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of such earnings is required if the company intends to reinvest such funds overseas our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our us operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our us operations we intend to reinvest these earnings in our nonus operations except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax as a result the company has not recognized additional income tax expense that may result from the remittance of these earnings however should our liquidity needs change or we decide to repatriate

higher net income in the 2013 period as well as additional receivable collections and other positive working capital changes these increases were partially offset by additional cash payments in the 2013 period for bonus commissions and taxes and we also had lower cash reimbursements in the 2013 period related to the completion of the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility 27investing cash used in our investing activities declined by 182 million in 2013 compared to 2012 the decrease was primarily due to 103 million of cash used in 2012 for the acquisition of ideas international and

when a parent sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity when a company ceases to have a controlling financial interest the company should recognize any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary had resided upon a partial sale the company should release into earnings a pro rata portion of the cumulative translation adjustment asu no 201305 is effective for the companys fiscal quarter ending march 31 2014 the guidance in asu 201305 will only impact the companys financial statements upon the occurrence of a transaction within its scope the fasb also continues to work on a number of significant accounting rules which may impact the companys accounting and disclosures in future periods since these rules have not yet been issued the effective dates and potential impact are unknown 30item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have exposure to changes in interest rates arising from borrowings under our 2013 credit agreement at december 31 2013 we had 2000 million outstanding under the 2013 credit agreement which consisted of 1444 million outstanding under the term loan and 556 million outstanding under the revolveramounts borrowed under the 2013 credit agreement bear interest at a rate equal to at gartners option either 1 the greatest of the administrative agents prime rate the average rate on overnight federal funds plus 12 of 1 and the eurodollar rate adjusted for statutory reserves plus 1 in each case plus a margin equal to between 025 and 075 depending on gartners leverage ratio as of the end of the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended or 2 the eurodollar rate adjusted for statutory reserves plus a margin equal to between 125 and 175 depending on gartners leverage ratio as of the end of the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended  we have an interest rate swap contract which effectively converts the floating base rate on the first 2000 million of our borrowings to a 226 fixed rate the company only hedges the base interest rate risk on the first 2000 million of its outstanding borrowings accordingly we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings in excess of 2000 million a 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates could change pretax annual interest expense on the additional revolver borrowing capacity under the 2013 credit agreement not including the expansion feature by approximately 09 millionforeign currency risk for the fiscal years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 45 and 46 of our revenues respectively were derived from sales outside of the us as a result we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar our foreign currency exposure results in both translation risk and transaction risk translation riskwe are exposed to foreign currency translation risk since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency translation risk arises since the assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and these exchange rates fluctuate over time these foreign currency translation adjustments are deferred and are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and do not impact our operating results a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our condensed consolidated balance sheets can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2013 we had almost 4240 million of cash and cash equivalents with approximately 58 denominated in foreign currencies if the foreign exchange rates of the major currencies in which we operate changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2013 would have increased or decreased by approximately 200 million because our foreign subsidiaries generally operate in a local functional currency that differs from the us dollar revenues and expenses in these foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar continuously weakens or strengthens against these other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations historically this impact on our consolidated earnings has not been material since foreign currency movements in the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally transaction risk we also have foreign exchange transaction risk since foreign subsidiaries typically enter into transactions in the normal course of business that are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the local functional currency in which the foreign subsidiary operates we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of foreign currency transaction risk these contracts are normally short term in duration and unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized in current period earnings at december 31 2013 we had 89 outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional amount of approximately 610 million and an immaterial net unrealized loss substantially all of these contracts matured by the end of january 2014 31credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and an interest rate swap contract the majority of the companys cash and cash equivalents and its interest rate swap contract are with large investment grade commercial banks that are participants in the companys 2013 credit agreement accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion item 8 financial statements and supplementary data our consolidated

forfeitures the service period is the period over which the related service is performed which is generally the same as the vesting period currently the company issues treasury shares upon the exercise release or settlement of stockbased compensation awards determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stockbased compensation awards and the common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the amount of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent managements best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the companys stockbased

valuation hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs used in the valuation of assets and liabilities classification within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the resulting fair value measurement the valuation hierarchy contains three levels level 1 measurements consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 measurements include significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves and other marketcorroborated inputs level 3 measurements include 62significant unobservable inputs such as internallycreated valuation models
