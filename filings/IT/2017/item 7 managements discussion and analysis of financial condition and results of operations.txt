business measurementsresearch total contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscriptionrelated contracts it is calculated as the annualized value of all contracts in effect at a specific point in time without regard to the duration of the contract total contract value primarily includes research deliverables for which revenue is recognized on a ratable basis as well as other deliverables primarily events tickets for which revenue is recognized when the deliverable is utilized      research contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscriptionrelated research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time without regard to the duration of the contract     client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients who were also clients a year ago by all clients from a year ago client retention is calculated at an enterprise level which represents a single company or customer     wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a 12month period wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients who were clients one year ago by the total contract value from a year ago excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange when wallet retention exceeds client retention it is an indication of retention of higherspending clients or increased spending by retained clients or both wallet retention is calculated at an enterprise level which represents a single company or customer   consulting consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from inprocess consulting measurement and strategic advisory services engagements     utilization rate represents a measure of productivity of our consultants utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill     billing rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours     average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure

service with a focus on client engagement and retention and continuously improving our operational effectiveness we had total revenues of 24 billion in 2016 an increase of 13 over 2015 on a reported basis and 14 adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange diluted earnings per share was 231 in 2016 compared to 206 in 2015 a 12 increase primarily driven by higher net income which increased 10 in 2016 and to a lesser extent a lower weightedaverage share count which declined 1  research revenues increased 16 yearoveryear to 183 billion in 2016 and adjusted for the impact of foreign currency research revenues increased 17 the contribution margin was 69 the same as 2015 at december 31 2016 total contract value was 193 billion an increase of 9 over december 31 2015 on a reported

while the number of attendees increased 4 in 2016 to 54602 for a more detailed discussion of our results see the segment results section below cash flow from our operating activities was 3656 million in 2016 an increase of 6 compared to 2015 our 2016 cash flow from operating activities benefited from the early adoption of fasb asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting which changed the accounting for stockbased compensation awards see note 1  business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information we ended 2016 with 4742 million in cash and cash equivalents while 11 billion was available for borrowing under the revolving credit line we continue to focus on maximizing shareholder value during 2016 we repurchased 06 million shares of our outstanding common stock and we also acquired two businesses in addition in january 2017 we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement whereby gartner will acquire all of the outstanding shares of ceb inc an industry leader in providing best practice and talent management insights see note 16  subsequent events in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information  fluctuations in quarterly results our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter as well as other events the timing and amount of new business generated the mix between domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of our new products and services competition in the industry acquisitions general economic conditions and other factors which are beyond our control the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below21the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results ongoing changes to our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements in future periods our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of us gaap as well as sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition sab no 104 revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows research revenues are mainly derived from subscription contracts for research products the related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term fees derived from assisting organizations in selecting the right business software for their needs is recognized when the leads are provided to vendors consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered andor services are provided revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all of the conditions related to their paymentevents revenues are deferred and then recognized upon the completion of the related symposium conference summit or exhibitionthe majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim uncollectible fees receivable  we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the determination of the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience an assessment of current economic conditions the aging of outstanding receivables the financial health of specific clients and probable losses this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands as of  december 31 2016 2015total fees receivable650413 587663allowance for losses7400 6900fees receivable net643013 580763goodwill and other intangible assets  the company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic no 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are our current operating results relative to our annual plan or historical performance changes in our strategic plan or use of our assets restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments competitive pressures and changes in the general economy or in the markets in which we operate and a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 22asc topic no 350 requires an annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill which can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature or a combination of the two both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty if our annual goodwill impairment evaluation determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount we may recognize an impairment charge against earnings among the factors we consider in a qualitative assessment are general economic conditions and the competitive environment actual and projected reporting unit financial performance forwardlooking business measurements and external market assessments a quantitative analysis requires management to consider all of the factors relevant to a qualitative assessment as well as the utilization of detailed financial projections to include the rate of revenue growth profitability and cash flows as well as assumptions regarding discount rates the companys weightedaverage cost of capital and other data in order to determine a fair value for our reporting units we conducted a qualitative assessment of the fair values of all of the companys reporting units during the third quarter of 2016 the results of this test concluded that the fair values of the companys reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying amounts see note 1  business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and amortizable intangible assets  accounting for income taxes  the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we consider the availability of loss carryforwards projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in making this assessment the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position accounting for stockbased compensation  the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topic no 505 and 718 and sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 sab no 107 and no 110 sab no 110 the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period see note 8  stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the companys common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the companys stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stockbased compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period in 2016 the company early adopted fasb asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting asu no 201609 requires certain changes in accounting for stock compensation under fasb asc topic no 718 note 1  business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the adoption of asu no 201609 restructuring and other accruals  we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until the end of our fiscal year 23results of operations consolidated results 2016

to modify certain covenants we have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities our operating cash flow has been continuously maintained and enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscriptionbased business model in our research segment which is our largest business segment revenues in our research segment increased 16 in 2016 compared to 2015 and constituted 75 and 73 of our total revenues in 2016 and 2015 respectively the majority of our research customer contracts are paid in advance and combined with a strong customer retention rate and

09 billion in ceb debt closing of the transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017 in connection with the proposed acquisition the company entered into a commitment letter for the

includes a sevenyear senior secured term loan b facility of up to 1375 billion a 364day senior unsecured bridge facility of up to 3000 million and a senior unsecured highyield bridge facility of up to

in lieu of a portion of or all of the drawings under the highyield bridge facility the company expects that the proceeds from the additional financing described above together with its balance sheet cash and available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to pay the aggregate cash consideration and refinance cebs indebtedness as well as pay for certain fees and

tax expense that could result from the remittance of these earnings 31however future events such as a change in our liquidity needs or us tax laws could cause us to change our repatriation policy and decide to repatriate some or all of these undistributed earnings as a result we could be required to accrue additional taxes in the future which could have a material impact on our consolidated

employee sharerelated activities provided cash of 4413 million2015 versus 2014operating operating cash flow decreased slightly when comparing 2015 to 2014 the decrease reflects the negative impact of

arrangements are accounted for as operating leases and are thus not recorded on the companys balance sheet asu no 201602 will significantly change the accounting for leases since a rightofuse rou model must be used in which the lessee must record a rou asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for leases with terms longer than 12 months leases will be classified as either finance or

revenue by removing inconsistencies and weaknesses in existing 35revenue recognition rules provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue recognition issues improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities industries jurisdictions and capital markets and provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosures we have completed an initial assessment of the impact of asu no 201409 on our existing revenue recognition policies and we plan to adopt the rule on january 1 2018 using the cumulative effect method of adoption asu no 201409 also requires significantly expanded disclosures around the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers which we are currently compiling while we have not completed our assessment of the impact of asu no 201409 based on the analysis completed to date we do not currently anticipate that the new rule will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the fasb also continues to work on a number of other accounting rules which if issued could impact our accounting policies and disclosures in future periods however since these rules have not yet been issued the effective dates and potential impact are unknown
