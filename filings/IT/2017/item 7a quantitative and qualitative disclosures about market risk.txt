interest rate risk the companys 2016 credit agreement provides for a fiveyear 6000 million term loan and a 12 billion revolving credit facility at december 31 2016 we had 7000 million outstanding under the 2016 credit agreement which included 5850 million outstanding under the term loan and 1150 million under the revolver the 2016 credit agreement was amended on january 20 2017 to permit the acquisition of ceb and the incurrence of an additional 1375 billion senior secured term loan b facility 3000 million 364day senior unsecured bridge facility and a senior unsecured highyield bridge facility of up to 6000 million or the issuance of a corresponding amount of debt securities to finance in part the acquisition and repay certain debt of ceb and to modify certain covenants in addition in connection with financing the ceb acquisition the company has received a commitment with respect to 6000 million senior unsecured bridge facilities we have cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates since amounts currently borrowed under our 2016 credit agreement are based on a floating base rate of interest however we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates through our interest rate swap contracts which effectively convert the floating base interest rate on the first 7000 million of our variable rate borrowings to fixed rates thus we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under the 2016 credit agreement only if our borrowings exceed 7000 million at december 31 2016 the amount of unhedged borrowings under the 2016 credit agreement was zero foreign currency risk for the fiscal years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 42 and 41 respectively of our revenues were derived from sales outside of the united states we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar the reporting currency of our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar as the values of the foreign currencies in which we operate fluctuate over time relative to the us dollar the company is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risktranslation risk arises as our foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency adjustments resulting from the translation of these assets and liabilities are deferred and recorded as a component of stockholders equity deficit a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2016 we had 4742 million of cash and cash equivalents with a substantial portion denominated in foreign currencies if the exchange rates of the foreign currencies we hold all changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2016 would have increased or decreased by approximately 210 million the translation of our foreign currency revenues and expenses historically has not had a material impact on our consolidated earnings since movements in and among the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally however our earnings could be impacted during periods of significant exchange rate volatility or when some or all of the major currencies in which we operate move in the same direction against the us dollar transaction risk arises because our foreign subsidiaries enter into transactions that are denominated in a currency that may differ from the local functional currency as these transactions are translated into the local functional currency a gain or loss may result which is recorded in current period earnings we typically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of some of this foreign currency transaction risk our outstanding currency contracts as of december 31 2016 had an immaterial net unrealized loss  36credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange contracts the majority of the companys cash and cash equivalents interest rate swap contracts and its foreign exchange contracts are with large investment grade commercial banks accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have a limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion
