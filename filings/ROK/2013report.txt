face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10kour enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant risks our erm process uses the integrated risk framework of the committee of sponsoring organizations coso to assess manage and monitor risks we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our growth and performance strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoiding risks we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extenta team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective chartersour goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value however the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results and could adversely affect our business and financial conditionadverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our sales and profitabilitywe are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur we may experience reduced orders payment delays supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliersdemand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve as economic activity slows credit markets tighten or sovereign debt concerns linger companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our productsour ability to access the credit markets and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions if our access to credit including the commercial paper market is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduceda substantial portion of our sales are to customers outside the us and we are subject to the risks of doing business in many countrieswe do business in more than 80 countries around the world approximately 50 percent of our sales in 2013 were to customers outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world the future success of our business depends in large part on growth in our sales in nonus markets our global operations are subject to numerous financial legal and operating risks such as political and economic instability prevalence of corruption in certain countries enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and compliance with existing and future laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs investments taxation trade controls product content and performance employment and repatriation of earnings in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest ratesnew legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our businesslegislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business for example we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material product certification labeling and customer requirements these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to ship our products into certain jurisdictions6table of contentsan inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our productsour success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could declinefailures or security breaches of our products or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our businesswe rely heavily on information technology it both in our products solutions and services for customers and in our enterprise it infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors targeting every type of it system including industrial control systems such as those we sell and service and corporate enterprise it systems these threat actors may engage in fraud theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotageour portfolio of hardware and software products solutions and services and our enterprise it systems may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses worms or other malicious software programs these attacks have sometimes been successfuldespite the precautions we take an intrusion or infection of software hardware or a system that we sold or serviced could result in the disruption of our customers business loss of proprietary or confidential information or injuries to people or property similarly an attack on our enterprise it system could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property or a breach of confidential customer or employee information any such events could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concernswe are in the process of developing and directing the implementation of a common global enterprise resource planning erp system that is resulting in redesigned processes organization structures and a common information system all with the objective of improving internal control and our ability to manage and monitor our global operations the implementations which were initiated by rockwell automation inc the us parent company of our consolidated group occurred in many locations in 2007 to 2013 and are scheduled to continue into 2015 as the parent company continues to drive this implementation the system and processes may not perform as expected or may require more time to implement this could have an adverse effect on our businessthere are inherent risks in our solutions and services businessesrisks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification including defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers if we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks we could incur cost overruns liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect our results of operationsour industry is highly competitivewe face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects we compete based on breadth and scope of our product portfolio and solution and service offerings technology differentiation product performance quality of our products and services knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers business challenges pricing delivery and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the markets and product areas that we serve we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers business problems if we fail to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality products and services we may experience price erosion lower sales and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability7table of contentswe face the potential harms of natural disasters terrorism acts of war international conflicts or other disruptions to our operationsnatural disasters acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create economic instability although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver productsintellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customersothers may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal costs to defend claims could be costlyin addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significantwe must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our tax expense and financial positionwe conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims by taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial positionour business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel while appropriately managing costs related to employee benefitsour success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefitsthe amount of expenses we record for our defined benefit pension plans depends on factors such as changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets significant decreases in market interest rates or the value of plan assets would increase our expenses expenses related to employerfunded health care benefits continue to increase as wellincreasing employee benefit costs or the failure to attract and retain members of our management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial conditionpotential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims and environmental remediation could reduce our profitabilityvarious lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to the safety and security of the products solutions and services we sell employment contract matters and environmental remediationwe have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities which could result in product liability claims the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution8table of contentsour operations are subject to regulation by various environmental regulatory authorities concerned with the impact of the environment on human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and waters the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significantwe have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do soa disruption to our distribution channel could reduce our salesin the united states and canada approximately 90 percent of our sales are through distributors in certain other countries the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors while we maintain the right to appoint new distributors any unplanned disruption to our existing distribution channel could adversely affect our sales a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of a distributor or other eventswe rely on vendors to supply equipment components and services which creates certain risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our businessour business requires that we buy equipment components and services including finished products which may include computer chips and commodities such as copper aluminum and steel our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks includingpoor quality or an insecure supply chain which could adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our productschanges in the cost of these purchases due to inflation exchange rates commodity market volatility or other factorsintellectual property risks such as ownership of rights or alleged infringement by suppliersinformation security risks associated with providing confidential information to suppliers andshortages of components commodities or other materials which could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies and ability to make timely deliveryany of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability or delivery delays of singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where substitute sources of supply are available qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of saleswe rely on strategic partners to expand our capabilities and to provide more complete automation solutions for our customers which creates certain risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business we have relationships with industryleading strategic partners that provide complementary technology expertise and thought leadership to enable us to enhance automation solutions for our customers if we fail to maintain or manage relationships with these thirdparty partner companies effectively or these partners are unable or unwilling to perform as expected our ability to execute our business strategy could be negatively affected9table of contentsour competitiveness depends on

necessary to operate at present levels11table of contentsitem 3 legal proceedingsasbestos we including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago currently there are a few thousand claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants together with hundreds of other companies in some cases the claims involve products from divested businesses and we are indemnified for most of the costs however we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their divestiture by us which occurred on january 31 2007 we also are responsible for half of the costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against rics divested measurement and flow control business but in all cases for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses in substantial part due to the integrity of the products the encapsulated nature of any asbestoscontaining components and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants we defend those cases vigorously historically we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimantswe have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs over and above selfinsured retentions for claims arising from our former allenbradley subsidiary following litigation against nationwide indemnity company nationwide and kemper insurance kemper the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to allenbradley we entered into separate agreements on april 1 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for ongoing and future coverage of allenbradley asbestos claims in exchange for a lump sum payment kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations to allenbradley nationwide entered into a cost share agreement with us to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for allenbradley asbestos claims we believe this arrangement will continue to provide coverage for allenbradley asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of the asbestos liabilitythe uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims that uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operationsother various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health intellectual property employment and contract matters although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations12table of

trendsin 2013 sales to us customers accounted for 50 percent of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our us served markets includethe industrial production index total index published by the federal reserve which measures the real output of manufacturing mining and electric and gas utilities the industrial production index is expressed as a percentage of real output in a base year currently 2007 historically there has been a meaningful correlation between the changes in the industrial production index and the level of automation investment made by our us customers in their manufacturing basethe manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi published by the institute for supply management ism which is an indication of the current and nearterm state of manufacturing activity in the us according to the ism a pmi measure above 50 indicates that the us manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contractingindustrial equipment spending which is an economic statistic compiled by the bureau of economic analysis bea this statistic provides insight into spending trends in the broad us industrial economy this measure over the longer term has proven to demonstrate a reasonable correlation with our domestic growthcapacity utilization total industry which is an indication of plant operating activity published by the federal reserve historically there has been a meaningful correlation between capacity utilization and levels of us industrial productionthe table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2011 to 2013 the pmi increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 indicates expansion in the us manufacturing sector industrial equipment spending and the industrial production index have been gradually improving while capacity utilization remained flat stability in both the recently reported and forecasted macroeconomic

we believe that these measures are useful to investors as measures of operating performance we use these measures to monitor and evaluate the profitability of the company our measure of total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin may be different from those used by other companies3beginning in fiscal 2013 we redefined segment operating earnings to exclude nonoperating pension costs nonoperating pension costs were reclassified to a separate line item within the above table for all periods presented these costs were previously included in segment operating earnings and in general corporatenet we continue to include service cost and amortization of prior service cost in the business segment that incurred the expense as these costs represent the operating cost of

discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows our accounting for sharebased compensation requires us to report the related excess income tax benefit as a financing

cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance our definition of free cash flow may differ from

with a weighted average interest rate of 027 percent our debttototalcapital ratio was 295 percent at september 30 2013 and 364 percent at september 30 2012 the decrease in the debttototalcapital ratio

credit facility we have not borrowed against these credit facilities during the years ended september 30 2013 and 2012 borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest based on shortterm money

commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under any of our credit facilities among other uses we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the shortterm credit ratings set forth in the table below under our current

is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective periods sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year when we acquire businesses we exclude sales in the

results or require subjective or complex judgments by managementretirement benefits  pensionpension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets the assumed annual compensation increase rate the retirement rate the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periodsour global pension expense in 2013 was 1681 million compared to 1047 million in 2012 approximately 77 percent of our 2013 global pension expense relates to our us pension plan the actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2013 us pension expense included the following discount rate of 415 percent compared to 520 percent for 2012 expected rate of return on plan assets of 800 percent compared to 800 percent for 2012 and an assumed longterm compensation increase rate of 400 percent compared to 400 percent for 2012in 2013 2012 and 2011 we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding

portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans our us longterm compensation increase rate will decrease to 375 percent for 2014 from 400 percent in 2013 we established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pensioneligible earnings for 2014 our expected rate of return on us plan assets will decrease to 750 percent from 800 percent in 2013 reflecting lower future expected market returns in estimating the expected return on plan assets we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term adjusted for forwardlooking considerations such as inflation interest rates equity performance and the active management of the plans invested assets we also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption the financial markets produced strong results in 2013 the plans debt securities return exceeded the expected return range in 2013 as lower market interest rates resulted in higher bond values the plans equity securities return exceeded the expected return range in 2013 largely due to higher us equity returns the actual return for our portfolio of us plan assets was approximately 730 percent

agreement of sale exists pricing is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred as may be required according to contract terms or services have been rendered within this category we will at times enter into arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products andor the performance of services such as installation and commissioning the timing of delivery though varied based upon the nature of the undelivered component is generally shortterm in nature for these arrangements revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on that elements relative selling price provided the delivered element has value to customers on a standalone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from thirdparty evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items if such evidence is not available we use our best estimate of the selling price which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factorswe recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as constructiontype contracts using either the percentageofcompletion or completed contract methods of accounting we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable we use the completed contract method for all others under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion under the percentageofcompletion method we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identifiedwe use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale we use shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis as well as the customers payment history34table of contentsreturns rebates and incentivesour primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria certain distributors are offered a right to return product subject to contractual limitationswe record accruals for customer returns rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 108 millionreturns rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or where a right of setoff exists as a reduction of accounts receivable the accrual for customer returns rebates and incentives was 1840 million at september 30 2013 and 1766 million at september 30 2012 of which 89 million at september 30 2013 and 79 million at september 30 2012 was included as an offset to accounts receivablelitigation claims and contingencieswe record liabilities for litigation claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate its value we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures the liabilities include expenses for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and third party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party at thirdparty environmental sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties if we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable and a right of setoff exists we record the liability net of the estimated recovery if we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable but a right of setoff does not exist we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation and a receivable for the estimated recovery at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation ongoing operating and maintenance expenditures included in our environmental remediation obligations are discounted to present value over the probable future remediation period our remaining environmental remediation obligations are undiscounted due to subjectivity of timing andor amount of future cash payments environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup to the extent that the required remediation procedures or timing of those procedures change additional contamination is identified or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected the estimate of our environmental liabilities may changeour accrual for environmental matters was 475 million net of 351 million of related receivables and 452 million net of 321 million of related receivables at september 30 2013 and 2012 respectively our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters we expect that gradually over a long period of time our environmental obligations will decline however changes in required remediation procedures or timing of those procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligationsour principal selfinsurance programs include product liability where we are selfinsured up to a specified dollar amount claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by insurance policies issued by commercial insurers we estimate the reserve for product liability claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims the reserve for product liability claims was 210 million and 223 million as of september 30 2013 and 2012 respectivelyvarious lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago see part i item 3 for further discussion35table of contentswe accrue for costs related to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset that results from the acquisition construction development or the normal operation of the longlived asset the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities we estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using sitespecific knowledge and historical industry expertise a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates we recorded these liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet which totaled 23 million and 34 million in other current liabilities at september 30 2013 and 2012 respectively and 220 million and 224 million in other liabilities at september 30 2013 and 2012 respectively in conjunction with the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses we agreed to indemnify baldor electric company for costs and damages related to certain legacy legal environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before january 31 2007 for which the maximum exposure is capped at the amount received for the sale we estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate 114 million of which 03 million and 16 million has been accrued in other current liabilities at september 30 2013 and 2012 respectively and 92 million and 88 million has been accrued in other liabilities at september 30 2013 and 2012 respectively a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimatesmore information regarding litigation claims and contingencies is contained in note 16 in the financial statementsincome taxeswe operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by us federal state and nonus taxing authorities additionally we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessmentswhile we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns taxing authorities may assert interpretations of laws and facts and may challenge cross jurisdictional transactions cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products services andor intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties was recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of 408 million and 703 million at september 30 2013 and 2012 respectively of which the entire amount would reduce our effective tax rate if recognized accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were 124 million and 201 million at september 30 2013 and 2012 respectively we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized the net impact on our income tax provision including the recognition of interest and penalties and offsetting tax assets would be 271 million as of september 30 2013 we believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to 164 million in the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of tax matters in various global jurisdictions and the lapses of statutes of limitations36table of contentswe recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss tax credit and capital loss carryforwards carryforwards and certain temporary differences in the amount of 283 million at september 30 2013 and 318 million at september 30 2012 based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax

will be able to use more carryforwards or certain temporary differences than currently expected conversely our income would decrease if we determine we are unable to realize our deferred tax assets in the futureour consolidated financial statements provide for tax liability on undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries that will be repatriated to the us as of september 30 2013 we have not provided us deferred taxes for 24270 million of such earnings since these earnings have been and under current plans will continue to be permanently reinvested outside the us at the end of each interim reporting period we estimate a base effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies we use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a yeartodate basis excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their related tax effects we record the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occurmore information regarding income taxes is contained in note 15 in the financial statementsrecent accounting pronouncementssee note 1 in the financial statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements37table of contentsitem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskwe are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debtforeign currency riskwe are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of 106 million and a liability of 117 million at september 30 2013 we enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthywe do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes in 2013 and 2012 the relative strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our sales and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar further strengthens relative to 2013 levelscertain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 15 millionwe record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivatives change in fair value in earnings immediately the ineffective portion was not significant in 2013 and 2012 a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operationsinterest rate riskin addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligationsour shortterm debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september 30 2013 were 1790 million with remaining maturities of five days at a weighted average interest rate of 017 percent commercial paper borrowings at september 30 2012 were 1570 million with remaining maturities of six days at a weighted average interest rate of 027 percent as these obligations mature we issued and anticipate continuing to issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations in 2013 and 2012 a 100 basis point increase in average market interest rates would have increased our interest expense by 21 million and 27 million respectively we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with a carrying value of 9051 million at september 30 2013 and 9050 million at september 30 2012 the fair value of this debt was 10722 million at september 30 2013 and 11879 million at september 30 2012 the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners equity38table of contentsitem 8 financial statements and supplementary dataconsolidated

strategy and market factorswe recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as constructiontype contracts using either the percentageofcompletion or completed contract method of accounting we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable we use the completed contract method for all others under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion under the percentageofcompletion method we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified44table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statements  continued1 basis of presentation and accounting policies  continuedwe use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale we use shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed

customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis as well as the customers payment historyshipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales and the related costs are

and enhancements and write off replaced units we expense maintenance and repairs as well as renewals of minor amountsintangible assetsgoodwill and other intangible assets generally result from business acquisitions we account for business acquisitions by allocating the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values the excess of the purchase price over the allocated amount is recorded as goodwill45table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statements  continued1 basis of presentation and accounting policies  continuedwe review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may be present any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations we perform an annual impairment test during the second quarter of our fiscal yearwe amortize certain customer relationships on an accelerated basis over the period of which we expect the intangible asset to generate future cash flows we amortize all other intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives useful lives assigned range from 3 to 10 years for trademarks 8 to 20 years for customer relationships 5 to 17 years for technology and 5 to 30 years for other intangible assetsintangible assets also include costs of software developed by our software business to be sold leased or otherwise marketed amortization of developed computer software products is calculated on

anticipated future gross revenue for that product b the straightline amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product or c onefourth of the total deferred software cost for the projectimpairment of longlived assetswe evaluate the recoverability of the recorded amount of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount if we determine that an asset is impaired we measure the impairment to be recognized as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell we determine fair value using a discounted future cash flow analysisderivative financial instrumentswe use derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risks we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty sale and intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next two years cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of certain assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies our accounting method for derivative financial instruments is based upon the designation of such instruments as hedges under us gaap it is our policy to execute such instruments with global financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countriesforeign currency translationwe translate assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states with a functional currency other than the us dollar into us dollars using exchange rates at the end of the respective period we translate sales costs and expenses at

position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position for tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we determine the amount of benefit to

basic eps is calculated by dividing earnings available to common shareowners which is income excluding the allocation to participating securities by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year excluding unvested restricted stock diluted eps amounts are based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year we use the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of outstanding sharebased compensation awards which requires us to compute total employee proceeds as the sum of a the amount the employee must pay upon exercise of the award b the amount of unearned sharebased compensation costs attributed to future services and c the amount of tax benefits if any that would be credited to additional paidin capital assuming exercise of the award sharebased compensation awards for which the total employee proceeds of the award exceed the average market price of the same award over the period have an antidilutive effect on eps and accordingly we exclude them from the calculation antidilutive sharebased compensation awards for the years ended september 30 2013 12 million shares 2012 23 million shares and 2011 21 million shares were excluded from the diluted eps calculation us gaap requires unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend

carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law does not require to use and the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with the deferred tax asset this guidance is effective for us prospectively for reporting periods beginning october 1 2014 the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in march 2013 the fasb issued new guidance related to the release of cumulative translation adjustment related to an entitys investment in a foreign entity the guidance clarifies that the guidance in subtopic 83030 foreign currency matters  translation of financial statements applies to the release of cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a reporting entity either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that constitute a business within a foreign entity this guidance is effective for us prospectively for reporting periods beginning october 1 2014 the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in february 2013 the fasb issued new accounting guidance which requires entities to present either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and the respective line items of net income affected by the reclassification but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income entities are required to crossreference to other disclosures that provide additional detail on those amounts this guidance is effective for us prospectively for reporting periods beginning october 1

the majority of our postretirement benefit plans for our other plans we assume the gross healthcare cost trend rate will decrease to 550 in 20172decreasing to 450 in 2017in determining the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption we consider actual returns on plan assets over the long term adjusted for forwardlooking considerations such as inflation interest rates equity performance and the active management of the plans invested assets we also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption this resulted in the selection of the weighted average

continuedthe investment objective for pension funds related to our defined benefit plans is to meet the plans benefit obligations while maximizing the longterm growth of assets without undue risk we strive to achieve this objective by investing plan assets within target allocation ranges and diversification within asset categories target allocation ranges are guidelines that are adjusted periodically based on ongoing monitoring by plan fiduciaries investment risk is controlled by rebalancing to target allocations on a periodic basis and ongoing monitoring of investment manager performance relative to the investment guidelines established for each manageras of september 30 2013 and 2012 our pension plans do not own our common stockin certain countries where we operate there are no legal requirements or financial incentives provided to companies to prefund pension obligations in these instances we typically make benefit payments directly from cash as they become due

on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each

reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to 164 million in the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of tax matters in various global

matters certain environmental liabilities are substantially indemnified by exxonmobil corporation at september 30 2013 we recorded a liability of 304 million and a receivable of 288 million for these matters we estimate the total reasonably possible costs that we could incur from these matters to be 306 millionbased on our assessment we believe that our expenditures for environmental capital

may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health intellectual property employment and contract matters although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operationswe including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago currently there are a few thousand claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants together with hundreds of other companies in some cases the claims involve products from divested businesses and we are indemnified for most of the costs however we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our former dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their divestiture by us which occurred on january 31 2007 we are also responsible for half of the costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against our former rockwell international corporations divested measurement and flow control business but in all cases for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses in substantial part due to the integrity of the products the encapsulated nature of any asbestoscontaining components and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants we defend those cases vigorously historically we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimantswe have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs over and above selfinsured retentions for claims arising from our former allenbradley subsidiary following litigation against nationwide indemnity company nationwide and kemper insurance kemper the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to allenbradley we entered into separate agreements on april 1 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for ongoing and future coverage of allenbradley asbestos claims in exchange for a lump sum payment kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations to allenbradley nationwide entered into a cost share agreement with us to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for allenbradley asbestos claims we believe that this arrangement with nationwide will continue to provide coverage for allenbradley asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of the asbestos liabilitythe uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims that uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations72table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statements  continued16 commitments and contingent liabilities  continuedwe have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do soin connection with the spinoffs of our former automotive component systems business semiconductor systems business and rockwell collins avionics and communications business the spunoff companies have agreed to indemnify us for substantially all contingent liabilities related to the respective businesses including environmental and intellectual property mattersin conjunction with the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses we agreed to indemnify baldor electric company for costs and damages related to certain legal legacy environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before january 31 2007 for which the maximum exposure would be capped at the amount received for the sale we estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate 114 million of which 03 million has been accrued in other current liabilities and 92 million has been accrued in other liabilities at september 30 2013 we recorded 16 million and 88 million in other current liabilities and other liabilities respectively at september 30 2012 for these indemnifications in many countries we provide a limited intellectual property indemnity as part of our terms and conditions of sale we also at times provide limited intellectual property indemnities in other contracts with third parties such as contracts concerning the development and manufacture of our products as of september 30 2013 we were not aware of any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible of an unfavorable outcome historically claims that have been made under the indemnification agreements have not had a material impact on our operating results financial position or cash flows however to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash
