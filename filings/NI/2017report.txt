utilities during the year ended december 31 2016 nipsco generated 664 and purchased 336 of its electric requirements nipsco participates in the miso transmission service and wholesale energy market the miso is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with ferc regulations to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability additionally the miso is responsible for managing energy markets transmission constraints and the dayahead realtime ftr and ancillary markets nipsco transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the miso and transmission service for nipsco occurs under the miso open access transmission tariffbusiness strategynisource focuses its business strategy on its core rateregulated assetbased businesses with most of its operating income generated from the rateregulated businesses nisources utilities continue to move forward on core infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all seven states in which it operates nisources goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as it addresses changing customer conservation patterns develops more contemporary pricing structures and embarks on longterm investment programs these strategies are intended to improve reliability and safety enhance customer services and reduce emissions while generating sustainable returnscompetition and changes in the regulatory environmentthe regulatory frameworks applicable to nisources operations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on nisources operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this environmentthe gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory the sale of products and services in the companies service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core 6table of contentsitem 1 businessnisource incmarkets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such situations as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and their ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has contributed to a longterm trend of declining average use per customer usage for the year ended december 31 2016 decreased from the same period last year primarily due to warmer weather in the companys operating area compared to the prior year while historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge operating costs are largely incurred on a fixed basis and do not fluctuate due to changes in customer usage as a result gas distribution operations have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred each of the states in which gas distribution operations operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing changes to rate design columbia of ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a decoupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges columbia of massachusetts received regulatory approval of a decoupling mechanism which adjusts revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor columbia of maryland and columbia of virginia have received regulatory approval to implement a revenue normalization adjustment for certain customer classes a decoupling mechanism whereby monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels are reconciled in subsequent months in a prior base rate proceeding columbia of pennsylvania implemented a pilot residential weather normalization adjustment columbia of kentucky has had approval for a weather normalization adjustment for many years in a prior base rate proceeding nipsco implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate designnatural gas competition open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers can purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or unbundling of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisources gas distribution operations subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations subsidiaries for transportation services gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service areas as well as other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and other alternate fuels such as propane and fuel oil gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity has traditionally been the strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia due to comparatively low electric rates natural gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market over the last few years however fuel oil and propane are more viable in todays oil marketelectric competition indiana electric utilities generally have exclusive service areas under indiana regulations and retail electric customers in indiana do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier nipsco

strategy which is dependent upon access to capital to fund its substantial investment programsome of nisources debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions nisources failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations a drop in nisources credit rating could adversely impact nisources liquidity the credit rating agencies periodically review the companys ratings taking into account factors such as our capital structure and earnings profile in 2016 moodys affirmed the nisource senior unsecured rating of baa2 and its commercial paper rating of p2 with stable outlooks moodys also affirmed nipscos baa1 rating and columbia of massachusettss baa2 rating with stable outlooks in 2016 standard amp poors affirmed the bbb senior unsecured ratings of nisource and its subsidiaries and affirmed nisources commercial paper rating of a2 with stable outlooks in 2016 fitch upgraded the longterm issuer default ratings of nisource and nipsco to bbb and affirmed the commercial paper rating of f3 with stable outlooks the company is committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings however there is no assurance we will be able to do so in the future the companys credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant any negative rating action could adversely affect our ability to access capital at rates and on terms that are attractive a negative rating action could also adversely impact our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners certain nisource subsidiaries have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are below investment grade these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power as of december 31 2016 the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 354 million in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact businessnisource may not be able to execute its business plan or growth strategy including utility infrastructure investmentsbusiness or regulatory conditions may result in nisource not being able to execute its business plan or growth strategy including identified planned and other utility infrastructure investments nisources customer and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results utility infrastructure investments may not materialize may cease to be achievable or economically viable and may not be successfully

flows and impact capital resources and liquidity needswhile the national economy is experiencing modest growth nisource cannot predict how robust future growth will be or whether or not it will be sustained deteriorating or sluggish economic conditions in nisources operating jurisdictions could adversely impact nisources ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs the company relies on access to the capital markets to finance its liquidity and longterm capital requirements market turmoil could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt reduced access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows refer to note 14 longterm debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debtcapital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earningsthe performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisources projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension or other postretirement benefit plan expense could negatively impact nisources results of operations and financial positionthe majority of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedingsmost of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisources financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approvalas a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisources growth strategy and financial positionfailure to adapt to advances in technology could make nisource less competitivea key element of nisources business model is that generating power at central station power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost research and development activities are ongoing for new technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption these technologies include renewable energy customeroriented generation energy storage and energy efficiency advances in technology or changes in laws or regulations could reduce the cost of these or other alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most central station power electric production or result in smallerscale more fuel efficient andor more cost effective distributed generation this could cause our market share to erode and the value of our generating facilities to decline in addition a failure by nisource to effectively adapt to changes in technology could harm nisources ability to remain competitive in the marketplace for its products services and processes10table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incnisource is exposed to significant reputational risks which make it vulnerable to a loss of cost recovery increased litigation and negative public perceptionas a utility company nisource is subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of our services and the speed with which nisource is able to respond effectively to electric outages natural gas leaks and similar interruptions caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events as well as our own or third parties actions or failure to act if customers legislators or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of nisource this could result in less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight increased litigation and negative public perception the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the business results of operations cash flow and financial condition of nisourcenisources businesses are regulated under numerous environmental laws the cost of compliance with these laws and changes to or additions to or reinterpretations of the laws could be significant liability from the failure to comply with existing or changed laws could have a material adverse effect on the business results of operations cash flows and the financial condition of nisourcenisources businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and rules that regulate among other things air emissions water usage and discharges and waste products such as coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisources facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisource fails to comply with environmental laws and regulations or is found to have caused damage to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisources control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and injunctions to remedy the failure or harm existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to increase environmental regulation of the energy industry may be adopted or become applicable to nisource revised or additional laws and regulations may result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisources facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could therefore impact nisources financial position financial results and cash flow moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisources facilitiesan area of significant uncertainty and risk are the laws concerning emission of ghg because nisource operates fossil fuel facilities emissions of ghgs are an expected and unavoidable aspect of the business while nisource continues to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be eliminated revised or additional future ghg legislation andor regulation could materially impact nisources financial position financial results and cash flowseven in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known or anticipated the original cost estimates for environmental capital projects remediation of past harm or the costs of operating pollution reduction strategies or equipment can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of impact the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect nisources financial position financial results and cash flows a significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly fluctuations in weather gas and electricity commodity costs and economic conditions impact demand of our customers and our operating resultsenergy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisources financial results lastly residential and commercial customers usage is sensitive to economic conditions and factors such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence therefore prevailing economic conditions may affect nisources financial resultsnisources business operations are subject

submitted its integrated resource plan with the iurc setting forth its short and longterm electric generation plans in an effort to maintain affordability while providing reliable flexible and cleaner sources of power however there are inherent risks and uncertainties including changes in market conditions environmental regulations commodity costs and customer expectations which may impede nipscos ability to achieve these intended results in addition the integrated resource plan included an intention to retire the bailly coal generation units units 7 and 8 as soon as mid2018 and two units units 17 and 18 at the rm schahfer generating station by the end of 2023 the miso subsequently approved nipscos plan to retire the two bailly coal generation units by may 31 2018 nipscos electric generation strategy could require significant future capital expenditures operating costs and charges to earnings that may negatively impact nisources financial position financial results and cash

coal and natural gas for fuel and its gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs from time to time nisource has used hedging in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the commodity costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely mannernisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreementsnisources extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterpartys financial condition credit history and other factors nisource monitors its credit risk exposure by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties by reference to marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and to traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies adverse economic conditions could result in an increase in defaults by customers suppliers and counterpartiesnisource has significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings and negatively impact nisources compliance with certain covenants under financing agreementsin accordance with gaap nisource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill also is tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable nisource would be required to record a charge in its financial statements for the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements nisource is subject to a financial covenant under its fiveyear revolving credit facility which requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain

electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks such as gas leaks downed power lines incidents including thirdparty damages large scale outages and mechanical problems which could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and the general public significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of its operations adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm which in turn could lead to substantial losses to nisource the location of pipeline facilities or generation transmission substation and distribution facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from such events the occurrence of such events could adversely affect nisources financial position and results of operations in accordance with customary industry practice nisource maintains insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses aging infrastructure may lead to disruptions in operations and increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs all of which could negatively impact nisources financial resultsnisource has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement a higher level of maintenance costs and unscheduled outages despite efforts by nisource to properly maintain or upgrade these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in incidents and in nisources inability to meet firm service obligations adversely impacting revenues and could also result in increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs which if not fully recovered from customers could negatively impact nisources financial resultsthe impacts of climate change natural disasters acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customersa disruption or failure of natural gas distribution systems or within electric generation transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane tornado terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions nisource has experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature the occurrence of such events could adversely affect nisources financial position and results of operations in accordance with customary industry practice nisource maintains insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses there is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure such risks include heat stresses to power lines storms that damage infrastructure lake and sea level changes that damage the manner in which services are currently provided droughts or other stresses on water used to supply services and other extreme weather conditions climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect nisources business in many ways including increasing the cost nisource incurs in providing its products and services impacting the demand for and consumption of its products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and affecting the economic health of the regions in which nisource operatesa cyberattack on any of nisources or certain thirdparty computer systems upon which

or decrease in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased or decreased interest expense by 117 million and 82 million for the years 2016 and 2015 respectively nisource and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk on longterm debt through forward starting interest rate swaps that hedge the interest rate risk related to forecasted issuances nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future debt issuances refer to note 9 risk management activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on nisources interest rate risk assets and liabilities as of december 31 2016 and 2015 credit riskdue to the nature of the industry credit risk is embedded in many of nisources business activities nisources extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy in addition risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation efforts exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function which is independent of commercial operations credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for derivativerelated contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to nisource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of creditnisource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers nisource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies33table of contentsitem 7 managements discussion and

hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement nisources financial assets and liabilities include price risk management assets and liabilities and availableforsale securitiesnisources risk management assets and liabilities can generally be grouped into commodity purchase contracts used to economically hedge against future changes in the price of coal or natural gas and interest rate swaps used to economically hedge against future changes in benchmark interest rates for commodity purchase contracts exchangetraded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within level 1 these financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations certain nonexchangetraded derivatives are valued using broker or overthecounter online exchanges in such cases these nonexchangetraded derivatives are classified within level 2 nonexchangebased derivative instruments may include futures swaps forwards and options in certain instances nisource may utilize models to measure fair value valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and marketcorroborated inputs ie inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability the instrument is categorized in level 2 certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation when such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value the instrument is categorized in level 3 credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchangetraded credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposuresnisources interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges each period the swap instruments will be measured assuming a hypothetical settlement at that point in time upon termination of the swap instruments nisource will pay or receive a settlement based on the current market value credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of each interest rate swap as they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments the interest rate swaps are categorized in level 2 in the fair value hierarchyavailableforsale securities are investments pledged as collateral for trust accounts related to nisources whollyowned insurance company availableforsale securities are included within other investments in the consolidated balance sheets nisource values us treasury corporate and mortgagebacked securities using a matrix pricing model that incorporates marketbased information these securities trade less frequently and are classified within level 2 total unrealized gains and losses from availableforsale securities are included in other comprehensive income lossrefer to note 16 fair value in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on nisources fair value measurementsother informationcritical accounting policiesnisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on nisources results of operations and consolidated financial statementsbasis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries asc topic 980 regulated operations provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 18854 million and 13818 million at december 31 2016 and 18067 million and 15818 million at december 31 2015 respectively for additional information refer to note 8 regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statementsin the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980 regulated operations in such event a writedown of all or a portion of nisources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting 34table of contentsitem 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsnisource incas regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980 regulated operations nisource would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 98020 discontinuation of rateregulated accounting in managements opinion nisources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980 regulated operations for the foreseeable futurecertain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisources consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to 3235 million at december 31 2016 if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amountspension and postretirement benefits nisource has defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value expected longterm returns on plan assets healthcare trend rates and mortality rates among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into aoci or a regulatory balance sheet account depending on the jurisdiction of the nisource entity these deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets this is known in gaap as the corridor methodthe discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions methods used to develop these assumptions are described below while a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions nisource is ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptionsthe discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs nisources discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using an aarated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participantsthe expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is a component utilized in calculating annual pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs nisource estimates the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns equity risk premiums target asset allocations the effects of active plan management the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance nisource also considers the guidance from its investment advisors in making a final determination of its expected rate of return on assets for measurement of 2017 net periodic benefit cost nisource selected an expected pretax longterm rate of return of 725 for its pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets nisource estimates the assumed health care cost trend rate which is used in determining our other postretirement benefit net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience the effects of recently enacted legislation thirdparty actuarial surveys and general economic conditions nisource has historically utilized the society of actuaries most recently published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 35table of contentsitem 7

pension and other postretirement benefits this change compared to the previous method is expected to result in a decrease in the actuariallydetermined service and interest cost components historically nisource estimated service and interest costs utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period for fiscal 2017 and beyond nisource elected to utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows nisource believes the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve the benefit obligations measured under this approach are unchanged nisource will account for this change as a change in accounting estimate and accordingly will account for this prospectively for further discussion of nisources pension and other postretirement benefits see note 11 pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements goodwill nisources goodwill assets at december 31 2016 were 16907 million most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 the separation prompted changes in the way nisources chief operating decision maker manages the business where going forward financial accountability is largely at the individual state operating company level this change in management approach triggered an assessment of nisources goodwill reporting units through this assessment nisource concluded each of the six state operating companies within the former columbia distribution operations reporting unit are now operating segments nisource further concluded these operating segments represent goodwill reporting units as they do not contain components whose discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by segment management goodwill previously allocated to the columbia distribution operations reporting unit was reallocated to the six new reporting units on a relative fair value basis nisources remaining reporting unit nipsco gas operations was not impacted by the changes in reporting structure as it was historically and continues to be reviewed by the chief operating decision maker at a state operating company levelas required by gaap nisource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist nisources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of may 1 2016nisource completed a quantitative step 1 fair value measurement of its reporting units during the may 1 2016 goodwill test consistent with nisources historical impairment testing of goodwill fair value of the reporting units was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches these approaches require significant judgments including appropriate longterm 36table of contentsitem 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsnisource incgrowth rates and discount rates for the income approach and appropriate multiples of earnings for peer companies and control premiums for the market approachthe discount rates were derived using peer company data compiled with the assistance of a third party valuation services firm the discount rates used are subject to change based on changes in tax rates at both the state and federal level debt and equity ratios at each reporting unit and general economic conditions the longterm growth rate was derived by evaluating historic growth rates new business and investment opportunities beyond the near term horizon the longterm growth rate is subject to change depending on inflationary impacts to the us economy and the individual business environments in which each reporting unit operatesthe may 1 2016 test indicated the fair value of each of the reporting units that carry or are allocated goodwill exceeded their carrying values indicating that no impairment existed under the step 1 annual impairment test if the estimates of free cash flow used in this step 1 analysis had been 10 lower the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying value for each of the reporting units tested holding all other assumptions constant revenue

assets related to the indiana net operating loss carry forward will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized in the first quarter of 2014 nisource recorded tax expense of 71 million to reflect the effect of this rate change this expense is largely attributable to the remeasurement of the indiana net operating loss at the 49 rate

which provides that employees of cpg no longer participate in benefit plans sponsored by nisource as of the separation date upon the completion of the separation the nisource pension and other postretirement benefit plans transferred assets and obligations to the cpg plans resulting in a net decrease in the pension plans underfunded status of 480 million and a net increase in the other postretirement benefit plans underfunded status of 1159 million refer to note 3 discontinued operations for additional information nisource pension and other postretirement benefit plans asset management nisource employs a liabilitydriven investing strategy for the pension plan as noted below while the majority of assets continue in a total return investment approach a glide path has been implemented a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the longterm return of plan assets and hedge the liabilities at a prudent level of risk nisource utilizes a total return investment approach for the other postretirement benefit plans risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and asset class volatility the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments furthermore equity investments are diversified across us and nonus stocks as well as growth value small and large capitalizations other assets such as private equity funds are used judiciously to enhance longterm returns while improving portfolio diversification derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner however derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying assets investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews annual liability measurements and periodic assetliability studiesnisource utilizes a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing in determining the longterm rate of return for plan assets historical markets are studied and longterm historical relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed to ensure that they are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate greater return over the long run current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriatenessthe most important component of an investment strategy is the portfolio asset mix or the allocation between the various classes of securities available to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans for investment purposes the asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established for the nisource plan assets represents a longterm view and are listed in the table below in 2012 a dynamic asset allocation policy for the pension fund was approved this policy calls for a gradual reduction in the allocation of returnseeking assets equities real estate private equity and hedge funds and a corresponding increase in the allocation of liabilityhedging assets fixed income as the funded status of the plans increase above 90 as measured by the market value of qualified pension plan assets divided by the projected benefit obligations of the qualified pension plans in 2016 a study was conducted and approved resulting in the addition of new asset classes in the returnseeking portfolio allocation ie core real estate diversified credit and a shift in the hedging allocation ie fixed income planned implementation of the new asset classes will begin in 2017 as of december 31

of return on pension and other postretirement plan assets respectively for its calculation of 2016 pension benefits cost these rates are primarily based on asset mix and historical rates of return and were adjusted in the current year due to anticipated changes in asset allocation and projected market returnsbeginning january 1 2017 nisource will change the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits this change compared to the previous method is expected to result in a decrease in the actuariallydetermined service and interest cost components historically nisource estimated service and interest costs utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period for fiscal 2017 and beyond nisource elected to utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows nisource believes the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve the benefit obligations measured under this approach are unchanged nisource will account for this change as a change in accounting estimate and accordingly will account for this prospectivelythe following table provides other changes in plan
