that benefit all stakeholders as it addresses changing customer conservation patterns develops more contemporary pricing structures and embarks on longterm investment programs these strategies are intended to improve reliability and safety enhance customer services and reduce emissions while generating sustainable returnscompetition and changes in the regulatory environmentthe regulatory frameworks applicable to nisources operations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on nisources operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this environmentthe gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory the sale of products and services in the companies service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core 6table of contentsitem 1 businessnisource incmarkets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such situations as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and their ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has contributed to a longterm trend of declining average use per customer usage for the year ended december 31 2016 decreased from the same period last year primarily due to warmer weather in the companys operating area compared to the prior year while historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge operating costs are largely incurred on a fixed basis and do not fluctuate due to changes in customer usage as a result gas distribution operations have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred each of the states in which gas distribution operations operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing changes to rate design columbia of ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a decoupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges columbia of massachusetts received regulatory approval of a decoupling mechanism which adjusts revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor columbia of maryland and columbia of virginia have received regulatory approval to implement a revenue normalization adjustment for certain customer classes a decoupling mechanism whereby monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels are reconciled in subsequent months in a prior base rate proceeding columbia of pennsylvania implemented a pilot residential weather normalization adjustment columbia of kentucky has had approval for a weather normalization adjustment for many years in a prior base rate proceeding nipsco implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate designnatural gas competition open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers can purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or unbundling of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisources gas distribution operations subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations subsidiaries for transportation services gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service areas as well as other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and other alternate fuels such as propane and fuel oil gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity has traditionally been the strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia due to comparatively low electric rates natural gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market over the last few years however fuel oil and propane are more viable in todays oil marketelectric competition indiana electric utilities generally have exclusive service areas under indiana regulations and retail electric customers in indiana do not have

authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisources financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approvalas a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisources growth strategy and financial

business results of operations cash flows and the financial condition of nisourcenisources businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and rules that regulate among other things air emissions water usage and discharges and waste products such as coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisources facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisource fails to comply with environmental laws and regulations or is found to have caused damage to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisources control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and injunctions to remedy the failure or harm existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to increase environmental regulation of the energy industry may be adopted or become applicable to nisource revised or additional laws and regulations may result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisources facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully

recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered gas cost to be included in future customer billingsat nipsco sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and overrecovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order these amounts are primarily reflected in the other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion the adjustments to other gross revenues for the twelve

operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities where customers can choose to purchase gas from a thirdparty supplier through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions these

significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value expected longterm returns on plan assets healthcare trend rates and mortality rates among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into aoci or a regulatory balance sheet account depending on the jurisdiction of the nisource entity these deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets this is known in gaap as the corridor methodthe discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions methods used to develop these assumptions are described below while a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions nisource is ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptionsthe discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs nisources discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using

pension and other postretirement benefits this change compared to the previous method is expected to result in a decrease in the actuariallydetermined service and interest cost components historically nisource estimated service and interest costs utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period for fiscal 2017 and beyond nisource elected to utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows nisource believes the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve the benefit obligations measured under this approach are unchanged nisource will account for this change as a change in accounting estimate and accordingly will account for this prospectively for further discussion of nisources pension and other postretirement benefits see note 11 pension and other postretirement
