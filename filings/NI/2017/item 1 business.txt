patterns develops more contemporary pricing structures and embarks on longterm investment programs these strategies are intended to improve reliability and safety enhance customer services and reduce

continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on nisources operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this environmentthe gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory the sale of products and services in the companies service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core 6table of contentsitem 1 businessnisource incmarkets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such situations as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and their ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has contributed to a longterm trend of declining average use per customer usage for the year ended december 31 2016 decreased from the same period last year primarily due to warmer weather in the companys operating area compared to the prior year while historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge operating costs are largely incurred on a fixed basis and do not fluctuate due to changes in customer usage as a result gas distribution operations have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred each of the states in which gas distribution operations operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing changes to rate design columbia of ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a decoupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges columbia of massachusetts received regulatory approval of a decoupling mechanism which adjusts revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor columbia of maryland and columbia of virginia have received regulatory approval to implement a revenue normalization adjustment for certain customer classes a decoupling mechanism whereby monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels are reconciled in subsequent months in a prior base rate proceeding columbia of pennsylvania implemented a pilot residential weather normalization adjustment columbia of kentucky has had approval for a weather normalization adjustment for many years in a prior base rate proceeding nipsco implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate designnatural gas competition open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers can purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or unbundling of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisources gas distribution operations subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations subsidiaries for transportation services gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service areas as well as other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and other alternate fuels such as propane and fuel oil gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity has traditionally been the strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia due to comparatively low electric rates natural gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market over the last few years however fuel oil and propane are more viable in todays oil marketelectric competition indiana electric utilities generally have exclusive service areas under indiana regulations and retail electric customers in indiana do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier nipsco faces nonutility competition from other energy sources such as selfgeneration by large industrial customers and other distributed energy sources financing subsidiarynisource finance is a 100 owned consolidated finance
