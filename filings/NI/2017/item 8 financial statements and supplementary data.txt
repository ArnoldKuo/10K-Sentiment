charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in customer rates and recovered from or refunded to customersin the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for regulatory accounting in such an event a writedown of all or a portion of nisources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery was approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued

is charged to accumulated depreciation however when it becomes probable a regulated asset will be retired substantially in advance of its original expected useful life or is abandoned the cost of the

depreciation on the consolidated balance sheets if the asset is no longer operating the net amount is classified in regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheets if nisource is able to recover a full return on investment the carrying value of the asset is based on historical cost if nisource is not able to recover a full return on investment a loss on impairment is recognized to the extent

investment approach for the other postretirement benefit plans risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and asset class volatility the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments furthermore equity investments are diversified across us and nonus stocks as well as growth value small and large capitalizations other assets such as private equity funds are used judiciously to enhance longterm returns while improving portfolio diversification derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner however derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying assets investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews annual liability measurements and periodic assetliability studiesnisource utilizes a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing in determining the longterm rate of return for plan assets historical markets are studied and longterm historical relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed to ensure that they are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate greater return over the long run current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriatenessthe most important component of an investment strategy is the portfolio asset mix or the allocation between the various classes of securities available to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans for investment purposes the asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established for the nisource plan assets represents a longterm view and are listed in the table below in 2012 a dynamic asset allocation policy for the pension fund was approved this policy calls for a gradual reduction in the allocation of returnseeking assets equities real estate private equity and hedge funds and a corresponding increase in the allocation of liabilityhedging assets fixed income as the funded status of the plans increase above 90 as measured by the market value of qualified pension plan assets divided by the projected benefit obligations of the qualified pension plans in 2016 a study was conducted and approved resulting in the addition of new asset classes in the returnseeking portfolio allocation ie core real estate diversified credit and a shift in the hedging allocation ie fixed income planned implementation of the new asset classes will begin in 2017 as of december 31

of return on pension and other postretirement plan assets respectively for its calculation of 2016 pension benefits cost these rates are primarily based on asset mix and historical rates of return and were adjusted in the current year due to anticipated changes in asset allocation and projected market returnsbeginning january 1 2017 nisource will change the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits this change compared to the previous method is expected to result in a decrease in the actuariallydetermined service and interest cost components historically nisource estimated service and interest costs utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period for fiscal 2017 and beyond nisource elected to utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows nisource believes the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve the benefit obligations measured under this approach are unchanged nisource will account for this change as a change in accounting estimate and accordingly will account for this prospectivelythe following table provides other changes in plan

ibm to continue to provide business process and support functions to nisource under a combination of fixed or variable charges with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services the agreement was effective january 1 2014 with a commencement date of april 1 2014 and includes some targeted service enhancements as well as continued existing information technology support services and a few additional support services nisource has initiated a process to evaluate its future it business process and support model which included the issuance of a request for proposal from several service providers including ibm upon any termination of the agreement by nisource for any reason other than material breach by ibm nisource may be required to pay ibm a termination charge that could include a breakage fee repayment of ibms capital investments not yet recovered and ibms winddown expense this termination fee could be material depending on the events giving rise to the termination and the timing of the terminationb guarantees and indemnities as a part of normal business nisource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries such agreements include guarantees and standby letters of credit these agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a standalone basis thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiaries intended commercial purposes at december 31 2016 nisource had issued standby letters of credit of 147 million for the benefit of third parties c legal proceedings the company is party to certain claims and

2015 nisource had recorded a liability of approximately 1114 million and 1232 million respectively to cover environmental remediation at various sites the current portion of this liability is included in legal and environmental in the consolidated balance sheets the noncurrent portion is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets nisource recognizes costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the original estimates for remediation activities may differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including currently enacted laws and regulations the nature and extent of impact the method of remediation and the availability of cost recovery these expenditures are not currently estimable at some sites nisource periodically adjusts its liability as information is collected and estimates

below for additional information airthe actions listed below could require further reductions in emissions from various emission sources nisource will continue to closely monitor developments in these mattersclimate change future legislative and regulatory programs including implementation of the epa cpp could significantly limit allowed ghg emissions or impose a cost or tax on ghg emissions additionally rules that increase methane leak detection require emission reductions or impose additional requirements for natural gas facilities could restrict ghg emissions and impose additional costs the cpp and other federally enacted or proposed ghg reduction measures are subject to numerous legal challenges that could change the way the programs are implemented and nisource will carefully monitor all ghg reduction proposals and regulations national ambient air quality standards the caa requires the epa to set naaqs for six criteria air pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment periodically the epa imposes new or modifies existing naaqs states containing areas that do not meet the new or revised standards or contribute significantly to nonattainment of downwind states may be required to take steps to achieve and maintain compliance with the standards these steps could include additional pollution controls on boilers engines turbines and other facilities owned by electric generation and gas distribution operationsthe following naaqs were recently added or modifiedozone on october 26 2015 the epa issued a final rule to lower the 8hour ozone standard from 75 ppb to 70 ppb after the epa proceeds with designations areas where nisource operates that are currently designated in attainment with the standards may be reclassified as nonattainment nisource will continue to monitor this matter and cannot estimate its impact at this timeclean power plan on october 23 2015 the epa issued a final rule to regulate co2 emissions from existing fossilfuel egus under section 111d of the caa the final rule establishes national co2 emissionrate standards that are applied to each states mix of affected egus to establish statespecific emissionrate and massemission limits the final rule requires each state to submit a plan indicating how the state will meet the epas emissionrate or massemission limit including possibly imposing reduction obligations on specific units if a state does not submit a satisfactory plan the epa will impose a federal plan on that state on february 9 2016 the us supreme court stayed implementation of the cpp until litigation is decided on its merits the cost to comply with this rule will depend on a number of factors including the outcome of cpp litigation the requirements of the state plan or final federal plan and the level of nipscos required co2 emission reductions it is possible that this new rule comprehensive federal or state ghg legislation or other ghg regulation could result in additional expense or compliance costs that could materially impact nisources financial results nipsco will continue to monitor this matter and cannot estimate its impact at this time should costs be

financial statements and supplementary data continuedwastecercla nisource subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties at waste disposal sites under the cercla commonly known as superfund and similar state laws additionally nisource affiliates have retained environmental liabilities including remediation liabilities associated with certain former operationsmgp a program has been instituted to identify and investigate former mgp sites where gas distribution operations subsidiaries or predecessors may have liability the program has identified 64 such sites where liability is probable remedial actions at many of these sites are being overseen by state or federal environmental agencies through consent agreements or voluntary remediation agreementsnisource utilizes a probabilistic model to estimate its future remediation costs related to its mgp sites the model was prepared with the assistance of a thirdparty and incorporates nisource and general industry experience with remediating mgp sites nisource completes an annual refresh of the model in the second quarter of each fiscal year no material changes to the estimated future remediation costs were noted as a result of the refresh completed as of june 30 2016 the total estimated liability at nisource related to the facilities subject to remediation was 1055 million and 1104 million at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the liability represents nisources best estimate of the probable cost to remediate the facilities nisource believes that it is reasonably possible that remediation costs could vary by as much as 25 million in addition to the costs noted above remediation costs are estimated based on the best available information applicable remediation standards at the balance sheet date and experience with similar facilitiesccrs on april 17 2015 the epa issued a final rule for regulation of ccrs the rule regulates ccrs under the rcra subtitle d which determines them to be nonhazardous the rule is implemented in phases and requires increased groundwater monitoring reporting record keeping and posting of related information to the internet the rule also establishes requirements related to ccr management and disposal the rule will allow nipsco to continue its byproduct beneficial use programthe publication of the ccr rule resulted in revisions to previously recorded legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain nipsco facilities the actual asset retirement costs related to the ccr rule may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased asset retirement obligation due to the uncertainty about the compliance strategies that will be used and the preliminary nature of available data used to estimate costs refer to note 7 asset retirement obligations for further information in addition to comply with the rule nipsco will be required to incur future capital expenditures to modify its infrastructure and manage ccrs based upon a preliminary engineering study capital compliance costs are currently expected to cost approximately 230 million as allowed by the epa nipsco will continue to collect data over time to determine the specific compliance solutions and associated costs and as a result the actual costs may vary nipsco has filed a petition with the iurc seeking approval of the projects and to recover the costs associated with ccr compliance waterelg on november 3 2015 the epa issued a final rule to amend the elg and standards for the steam electric power generating category the final rule became effective

certain upgrade sponsors for both tuas filed a complaint at the ferc against nipsco regarding the multiplier stated in the tuas on june 30 2014 nipsco filed an answer defending the terms of the tuas and the just and reasonable nature of the multiplier charged therein and moved for dismissal of the complaint on december 8 2014 the ferc issued an order in response to the complaint finding that it is appropriate for nipsco to recover through the multiplier substantiated costs of ownership related to the tuas on august 10 2016 nipsco reached settlement with all remaining parties to the complaint and filed with the ferc for approval an order from the ferc approving the settlement was received on january 31 2017 receipt of the ferc order did not result in a material impact to the consolidated financial statements at the time the tuas were executed it was assumed the proceeds received from the upgrade sponsors would be taxable to nipsco accordingly the multiplier included a provision for such taxes on june 10 2016 the us treasury department issued a notice 93table of contentsnisource incnotes to consolidated financial statementsitem 8 financial statements and supplementary data

factors including low natural gas prices and aging coalfired units have led nipsco to consider modifying its current electric generation supply mix to include less coalfired generation  due to enacted ccr and elg legislation nipsco would expect to incur over 1 billion in operating maintenance environmental and other costs over the next seven years if the current fleet of coalfired generating units remain operational on november 1 2016 nipsco submitted its 2016 integrated resource plan with the iurc the plan evaluates demandside and supplyside resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet nipsco customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years the 2016 integrated resource plan indicates that the most viable option for customers and nipsco involves the retirement of bailly generating station units 7 and 8 as soon as mid2018 and two units units 17 and 18 at the rm schahfer generating station by the end of 2023 it is projected over the long term that the cost to customers to retire these units at these dates will be lower than maintaining and upgrading them for continuing generation nisource and nipsco committed to the retirement of the bailly generating station units in connection with the filing of the 2016 integrated resource plan however retirement of these units is subject to the approval of the miso which is responsible for coordinating controlling and monitoring the use of the electric transmission system by utilities generators and marketers across parts of 15 us states and the canadian province of manitoba in the fourth quarter of 2016 the miso approved nipscos plan to retire the bailly generating station units by may 31 2018 in accordance with asc 980360 the remaining net book value of the bailly generating
