businesses with most of its operating income generated from the rateregulated businesses nisources utilities continue to move forward on core infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all seven states in which it operates nisources goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as it addresses changing customer conservation patterns develops more contemporary pricing structures and embarks on longterm investment programs these strategies are intended to improve reliability and safety enhance customer services and reduce emissions while generating sustainable returnscompetition and changes in the regulatory environmentthe regulatory frameworks applicable to nisources operations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on nisources operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this environmentthe gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory the sale of products and services in the companies service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core 6table of contentsitem 1 businessnisource incmarkets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such situations as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and their ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has contributed to a longterm trend of declining average use per customer usage for the year ended december 31 2016 decreased from the same period last year primarily due to warmer weather in the companys operating area compared to the prior year while historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge operating costs are largely incurred on a fixed basis and do not fluctuate due to changes in customer usage as a result gas distribution operations have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred each of the states in which gas distribution operations operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing changes to rate design columbia of ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a decoupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges columbia of massachusetts received regulatory approval of a decoupling mechanism which adjusts revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor columbia of maryland and columbia of virginia have received regulatory approval to implement a revenue normalization adjustment for certain customer classes a decoupling mechanism whereby monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels are reconciled in subsequent months in a prior base rate proceeding columbia of pennsylvania implemented a pilot residential weather normalization adjustment columbia of kentucky has had approval for a weather normalization adjustment for many years in a prior base rate proceeding nipsco implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate designnatural gas competition open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers can purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or unbundling of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisources gas distribution operations subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations subsidiaries for transportation services gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service areas as well as other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and other alternate fuels such as propane and fuel oil gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity has traditionally been the strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia due to comparatively low electric rates natural gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market over the last few years however fuel oil and propane are more viable in todays oil marketelectric competition indiana electric utilities generally have exclusive service areas under indiana regulations and retail electric customers in indiana do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier nipsco

crossdefault provisions nisources failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations a drop in nisources credit rating could adversely impact nisources liquidity the credit rating agencies periodically review the companys ratings taking into account factors such as our capital structure and earnings profile in 2016 moodys affirmed the nisource senior unsecured rating of baa2 and its commercial paper rating of p2 with stable outlooks moodys also affirmed nipscos baa1

commercial paper rating of a2 with stable outlooks in 2016 fitch upgraded the longterm issuer default ratings of nisource and nipsco to bbb and affirmed the commercial paper rating of f3 with stable outlooks the company is committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings however there is no assurance we will be able to do so in the future the companys credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant any negative rating action could adversely affect our ability to access capital at rates and on terms that are attractive a negative rating action could also adversely impact our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners certain nisource subsidiaries have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are below investment grade these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power as of december 31 2016 the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 354 million in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit

decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earningsthe performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisources projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension or other postretirement benefit plan expense could negatively impact nisources results of operations and financial positionthe majority of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedingsmost of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisources financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approvalas a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisources growth strategy and financial positionfailure to adapt to advances in technology could make nisource less competitivea key element of nisources business model is that generating power at central station power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost research and development activities are ongoing for new technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption these technologies include renewable energy customeroriented generation energy storage and energy efficiency advances in technology or changes in laws or regulations could reduce the cost of these or other alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most central station power electric production or result in smallerscale more fuel efficient andor more cost effective distributed generation this could cause our market share to erode and the value of our generating facilities to decline in addition a failure by nisource to effectively adapt to changes in technology could harm nisources ability to remain competitive in the marketplace for its products services and processes10table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incnisource is exposed to significant reputational risks which make it vulnerable to a loss of cost recovery increased litigation

to electric outages natural gas leaks and similar interruptions caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events as well as our own or third parties actions or failure to act if customers legislators or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of nisource this could result in less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight increased litigation and negative public perception the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the business results of operations cash flow and financial condition of nisourcenisources businesses are regulated under numerous environmental laws the cost of compliance with these laws and changes to or additions to or reinterpretations of the laws could be significant liability from the failure to comply with existing or changed laws could have a material adverse effect on the business results of operations cash flows and the financial condition of nisourcenisources businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and rules that regulate among other things air emissions water usage and discharges and waste products such as coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisources facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisource fails to comply with environmental laws and regulations or is found to have caused damage to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisources control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and injunctions to remedy the failure or harm existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to increase environmental regulation of the energy industry may be adopted or become applicable to nisource revised or additional laws and regulations may result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisources facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could therefore impact nisources financial position financial results and cash flow moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisources facilitiesan area of significant uncertainty and risk are the laws concerning emission of ghg because nisource operates fossil fuel facilities emissions of ghgs are an expected and unavoidable aspect of the business while nisource continues to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be eliminated revised or additional future ghg legislation andor regulation could materially impact nisources financial position financial results and cash flowseven in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known or anticipated the original cost estimates for environmental capital projects remediation of past harm or the costs of operating pollution reduction strategies or equipment can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of impact the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect nisources financial position financial results and cash flows a significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly fluctuations in weather gas and electricity commodity costs and economic conditions impact demand of our customers and our operating resultsenergy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisources financial results lastly residential and commercial customers usage is sensitive to economic

coal and natural gas for fuel and its gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs from time to time nisource has used hedging in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the commodity costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely mannernisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreementsnisources extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterpartys financial condition credit history and other factors nisource monitors its credit risk exposure by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties by reference to marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and to traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies adverse economic conditions could result in an increase in defaults by customers suppliers and counterpartiesnisource has significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings and negatively impact nisources compliance with certain covenants under financing agreementsin accordance with gaap nisource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill also is tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable nisource would be required to record a charge in its financial statements for the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements nisource is subject to a financial covenant under its fiveyear revolving credit facility which requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain
