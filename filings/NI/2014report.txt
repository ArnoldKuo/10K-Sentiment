securitiesnisource has substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial conditionnisource had total consolidated indebtedness of 88340 million outstanding as of december 31 2013 the substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could limit the ability to borrow additional funds or increase the cost of borrowing additional fundsreduce the availability of cash flow from operations to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposeslimit the flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the business and the industries in which the company operateslead parties with whom nisource does business to require additional credit support such as letters of credit in order for nisource to transact such

to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions nisources failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations additionally a drop in nisources credit rating could adversely impact the cost for nisource to issue new debt securitiesa drop in nisources credit rating could adversely impact nisources liquidityon january 31 2014 moodys investors service upgraded the senior unsecured rating for nisource to baa2 from baa3 and nisources commercial paper rating to p2

stable although all ratings continue to be investment grade a downgrade by standard amp poors or fitch would result in a rating that is below investment gradecertain nisource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below bbb by standard amp poors or baa3 by moodys these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 354 million in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business these requirements combined with other potential negative effects on nisources liquidity in the event of a credit downgrade below an investment grade rating could have a material adverse effect on earnings potential and cash flows lastly a credit downgrade could adversely affect the availability and cost of capital needed to fund the growth investments which are a central element of the companys longterm business strategy nisource may not be able to execute its growth strategy as plannedbecause of changes in the business or regulatory environment nisource may not be able to execute its fourpart business plan as intended nisources commercial and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results levels of commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business may be less than its plan has anticipated natural gas production activity including production facilitated by hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect nisources gas transmission storage and midstream business expansion opportunities and therefore the actual results of nisources financial management of the balance sheet and process and expense management could deviate materially from planned outcomes in addition nisources growth plan relies on the continued view of natural gas as an economically and 9table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incecologically attractive fuel any developments that cause natural gas no longer to be seen as a favored fuel could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospectsadverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce net revenue growth increase costs decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and liquidity needswhile the national economy is experiencing some recovery from the recent downturn nisource cannot predict how robust the recovery will be or whether or not it will be sustainedcontinued sluggishness in the economy impacting nisources operating jurisdictions could adversely impact nisources ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs an increase in the interest rates nisource pays would adversely affect future net income and cash flows in addition nisource depends on debt to finance its operations including both working capital and capital expenditures and would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates if the current economic recovery remains slow or credit markets again tighten nisources ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at a reasonable cost could be negatively impacted refer to note 16 longterm debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debtcapital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earningsthe performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisources projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact nisources results of operations and financial positionthe majority of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedingsmost of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisources financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approvalas a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisources growth strategy and cash flows nisources costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the recognition of environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitabilitynisources subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste solid waste and coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisources facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisources subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisources control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and its subsidiaries10table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incexisting environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to nisources subsidiaries revised or additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisources facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisources facilitiesbecause nisources operations deal with natural gas and coal fossil fuels emissions of ghgs are an expected aspect of the business while nisource attempts to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be entirely eliminated the current administration has made it clear that it is focused on reducing ghg emissions through legislation andor regulation imposing statutory or regulatory restrictions andor costs on ghg emissions could increase nisources cost of producing energy which could impact customer demand or nisources profitability compliance costs associated with these requirements could also affect nisources cash flow the cost impact of any new or amended ghg legislation or regulations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this timeeven in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known the original estimates for cleanup and environmental capital projects can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of contamination the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery from customers changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect nisources financial position operating results and cash flowsa significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly the operating results fluctuate depending on the weather and to a certain extent usage of gas or electricityenergy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisources financial results lastly residential and commercial customers usage has shown to be sensitive to economic conditions and the impact of macroeconomic drivers such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence which could also affect nisources financial resultsnisources business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industriesbusiness operations throughout nisources service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates in particular sales to large industrial customers may be impacted by economic downturns the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its productsfluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs may have a negative impact on nisources financial resultsnisources electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and its gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs hedging activities have been deployed in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices and nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner additionally increased gas and electricity costs could result in reduced demand from customers as a result of increased conservation activitiesnisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreementsnisources extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterpartys financial condition credit history and other factors credit risk exposure is monitored by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies continued adverse economic conditions could increase credit risk and could result in a material adverse effect on nisource11table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incnisource has significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earningsin accordance with gaap nisource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill also is tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable nisource would be required to record a charge in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements nisource is subject to a financial covenant under its fiveyear revolving credit facility and its three year term loan which requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75 as of december 31 2013 the ratio was 600changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect nisources financial resultsnisource is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where it does business legislation or regulation which could affect nisources tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities nisource cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which could have a negative impact on the financial results additionally nisource uses its best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations however a challenge by a taxing authority nisources ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimateschanges in accounting principles may adversely affect nisources financial resultsfuture changes in accounting rules and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the way nisource records revenues expenses assets and liabilities these changes in accounting standards may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations transportation and storage of natural gas as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costsnisources gas distribution and gas transmission and storage activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks such as gas leaks downed power lines accidents including third party damages large scale outages and mechanical problems which could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and the general public significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of its operations adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm which in turn could lead to substantial losses to nisource in accordance with customary industry practice nisource maintains insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the location of pipelines and storage facilities or generation transmission substations and distribution facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect nisources financial position and results of operations aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact nisources financial resultsnisource has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement a higher level of maintenance costs and unscheduled outages despite diligent efforts by nisource to properly maintain these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in nisources inability to meet firm service obligations adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures and expenses which may not be fully recoverable from customers12table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incclimate change natural disasters acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customersa disruption or failure of natural gas transmission storage or distribution systems or

insurance for these risks could adversely affect nisources results of operations financial position and cash flowsthere is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure associated with heat and extreme weather conditions climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect nisources business in many ways including increasing the cost nisource incurs in providing its products and services impacting the demand for and consumption of its products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and affecting the economic health of the regions in which nisource operatesa cyberattack on any of nisources or certain third party computer systems upon which nisource relies may adversely affect its ability to operatenisource is reliant on technology to run its businesses which are dependent upon financial and operational computer systems to process critical information necessary to conduct various elements of its business including the generation transmission and distribution of electricity operation of its gas pipelines and storage facilities and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions to regulators investors and other stakeholders any failure of nisources computer systems or those of its customers suppliers or others with whom it does business could materially disrupt nisources ability to operate its business and could result in a financial loss and possibly do harm to nisources reputation additionally nisources information systems experience ongoing often sophisticated cyberattacks by a variety of sources with the apparent aim to breach nisources cyberdefenses although nisource attempts to maintain adequate defenses to these attacks and works through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess nisources countermeasures a security breach of nisources information systems could i impact the reliability of nisources generation transmission storage and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact nisources compliance with certain mandatory reliability standards ii subject nisource to harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information personal or otherwise relating to nisources customers or employees or iii impact nisources ability to manage nisources businesses nisources capital projects subject it to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risksnisources columbia pipeline group operations continues to complete and advance customerdriven expansion projects across its system and develop its midstream business through gathering and processing activities primarily surrounding the marcellus and utica shale production area in the states of pennsylvania ohio and west virginia additionally nisource is executing on its comprehensive interstate natural gas pipeline modernization program these modernization projects include constructing or replacing pipelines and other facilities which subjects nisource to construction risks and risks that gas supplies may not be available some expansion projects may also be subject to risks related to fluctuation in construction and gas costs both modernization and expansion projects are reliant on the contractual performance of vendors and suppliers of materials and supplies and services nonperformance or underperformance could subject nisource to increased costs further nisource is subject to regulatory approval of various projects delays in this process could increase costs of the projects nisource competes for these projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities including some that may have advantages competing for natural gas and liquid gas supplies as well as acquisitions and other business opportunities similarly nisource gas distribution operations is engaged in an intrastate natural gas pipeline modernization program to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility nipsco also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects including airquality related improvements to its electric generating stations as well as the construction of new transmission facilities as nisource undertakes these projects it may not be able to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs additionally nisource may construct or purchase some of these projects to capture anticipated future growth in natural gas production which may not materialize and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time nisource also may not receive material increases in revenue and cash flows until after the completion of the projects 13table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incsustained extreme weather conditions may negatively impact nisources operationsnisource conducts its operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially extreme weather conditions which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time despite preventative maintenance efforts persistent weather related stress on nisources infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in its systems not previously known to the company or otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments although nisource makes every effort to plan for weather related contingencies adverse weather may affect its ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual obligations the company endeavors to minimize such service disruptions but may not be able to avoid them altogethergrowing competition in the gas transportation and storage industries could result in the failure by customers to renew existing contractsas a consequence of the increase in competition and the shift in natural gas production areas customers such as ldcs and other end users may be reluctant to enter into longterm service contracts the renewal or replacement of existing contracts with nisources customers at rates sufficient to maintain current or projected revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond its control including competition from other pipelines gatherers the proximity of supplies to the markets and the price of and demand for natural gas the inability of nisource to renew or replace its current contracts as they expire and respond appropriately to changing market conditions could materially impact its financial results and cash flowsnisource is a holding company and is dependent on cash generated by subsidiaries to meet its debt obligations and pay dividends on its common stocknisource is a holding company and conducts its

revenuesnisource analyzes the operating results using net revenues net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization nisource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenuestotal consolidated net revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 were 38418 million a 3278 million increase compared

1881 million due to system growth in the marcellus shale areanature of sales  columbia transmission and columbia gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility available capacity and price columbia gulf and columbia transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contractsfirm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used the high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the columbia pipeline group operations segment due to changes in nearterm supply and demand conditions the following percentages exclude the impact of intrasegment revenues trackerrelated revenues and the 50 million refund recorded in the third quarter of 2012 resulting from the columbia transmission customer settlement for the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 931 of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 50 of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to 914 and 57 respectively for the twelve months ended december 31 2012interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service these customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported the ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities columbia pipeline group operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets for the year ended december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 19 and 29 respectively of the transportation revenues were derived from

includes both billed and unbilled amounts as nisource believes that total accounts receivable is a more meaningful presentation given the factors which impact both billed and unbilled accounts receivable unbilled revenue is based on estimated amounts of electric energy or natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its customers unbilled amounts of accounts receivable relate to a portion of a customers consumption of gas or electricity from the date of the last cycle billing date through the last day of the month balance sheet date factors taken into consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage customer rates and weather accounts receivable fluctuates from year to year depending in large part on weather impacts and price volatility nisources accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets includes unbilled revenue less reserves in the amounts of 3215 million and 2857 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the

measurement of its reporting units during the may 1 2012 goodwill test the test indicated that the fair value of each of the reporting units that carry or are allocated goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values indicating that no impairment existed under the step 1 annual impairment testin estimating the fair value of the columbia transmission operations and columbia distribution operations reporting units for the may 1 2012 test nisource used a weighted average of the income and market approaches the income approach utilized a discounted cash flow model this model was based on managements shortterm and longterm forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit the two main assumptions used in the models were the growth rates which were based on the cash flows from operations for each of the reporting units and the weighted average cost of capital or discount rate the starting point for each reporting units cash flow from operations was the detailed five year plan which takes into consideration a variety of factors such as the current economic environment industry trends and specific operating goals set by management the discount rates were based on trends in overall market as well as industry specific variables and include components such as the riskfree rate cost of debt and company volatility at may 1 2012 under the market approach nisource utilized three marketbased models to estimate the fair value of the reporting units i the comparable company multiples method which estimated fair value of each reporting unit by analyzing ebitda multiples of a peer group of publicly traded companies and applying that multiple to the reporting units ebitda ii the comparable transactions method which valued the reporting unit based on observed ebitda multiples from completed transactions of peer companies and applying that multiple to the reporting units ebitda and iii the market capitalization method which used the nisource share price and allocated nisources total market capitalization among both the goodwill and nongoodwill reporting units based on the relative ebitda revenues and operating income of each reporting unit each of the three market approaches were calculated with the assistance of a third party valuation firm using multiples and assumptions inherent in todays market the degree of judgment involved and reliability of inputs into each model were considered in weighting the various approaches the resulting estimate of fair value of the reporting units using the weighted average of the income and market approaches exceeded their carrying values indicating that no impairment exists under step 1 of the annual impairment testcertain key assumptions used in determining the fair values of the reporting units included planned operating results discount rates and the longterm outlook for growth in 2012 nisource used discount rates of 560 for both columbia transmission operations and columbia distribution operations resulting in excess fair values of approximately 16430 million and 16820 million respectively the results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment testgoodwill at nipsco gas distribution operations related to the acquisition of northern indiana fuel and light and kokomo gas of 178 million was also tested for impairment as of may 1 2012 the income approach was used to determine the fair value of the nipsco gas distribution reporting unit key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 560 and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations these cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives the step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the nipsco gas distribution reporting unit to be above the carrying value by 3560 millionin september 2011 fasb issued accounting standards update 201108 which allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative step 0 assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test if a step 0 assessment is performed an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that based on the qualitative step 0 assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount the update was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011nisource applied this guidance for its 2013 annual test and applied the qualitative step 0 analysis to its reporting units for the annual impairment test performed as of may 1 2013for the current year qualitative step 0 test performed as of may 1 2013 nisource assessed various assumptions events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units in its baseline may 1 2012 test the results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that its reporting unit fair values are less than the reporting unit carrying values and no impairments are necessary 72table of contentsitem 8 financial statements

would reduce the fair value of any of the reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate another goodwill impairment test no such indicators were noted that would require a subsequent

derivative instruments are commodity price risk and interest rate risk derivative natural gas contracts are entered into to manage the price risk associated with natural gas price volatility and to secure forward natural gas prices interest rate swaps are entered into to manage interest rate risk or fair value risk associated with nisources borrowings nisource designates some of its commodity forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases of commodities and designates its interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixedrate borrowings additionally certain nisource subsidiaries enter into forward physical contracts with various third parties to procure or sell natural gas or power certain forward physical contracts are derivatives which qualify for and for which nisource may elect the normal purchase and normal sales exception which do not require marktomarket accountingaccounting policy for derivative instruments the asc topic on accounting for derivatives and hedging requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value unless such contracts are exempted such as normal purchase and normal sale contracts under the provisions of the asc topic the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designationnisource uses a variety of derivative instruments exchange traded futures and options physical forwards and options commodity swaps and interest rate swaps to effectively manage its commodity price risk and interest rate risk exposure if certain conditions are met a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment or b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective the effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter throughout the period that the hedge is designated any amounts determined to be ineffective are recognized currently in earnings for derivative contracts that qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales exception a contracts fair value is not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until the contract is settledunrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of aoci regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the designation of the derivative instrument and regulatory accounting treatment for subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to aoci and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks if a forecasted transaction corresponding to a cash flow hedge is no longer probable to occur the accumulated gains or losses on the derivative are recognized currently in earnings for fair value hedges the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period together with the change in the fair value of the hedged item as a result of the ratemaking process the rateregulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows these gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back to customers in revenues through rates when gains and losses are recognized in earnings they are recognized in revenues or cost of sales for derivatives that correspond to commodity risk activities and are recognized in interest expense for derivatives that correspond to interestrate risk activities82table of

exposed to variability in cash flows associated with natural gas purchases and volatility in natural gas prices nisource purchases natural gas for sale and delivery to its retail commercial and industrial customers and for most customers the variability in the market price of gas is passed through in their rates some of nisources utility subsidiaries offer programs where variability in the market price of gas is assumed by the respective utility the objective of nisources commodity price risk programs is to mitigate this gas cost variability for nisource or on behalf of its customers associated with natural gas purchases or sales by economically hedging the various gas cost components by using a combination of futures options forward physical contracts or other derivative contracts nipsco also uses derivative contracts to minimize risk associated with power price volatility these commodity price risk programs and their respective accounting treatment are described belownipsco columbia of pennsylvania columbia of kentucky and columbia of virginia use nymex futures and nymex options to minimize risk associated with gas price volatility these derivative programs must be marked to fair value but because these derivatives are used within the framework of the companies gcr or fac mechanism regulatory assets or liabilities are recorded to offset the change in the fair value of these derivativesnipsco and columbia of virginia offer a fixed price program as an alternative to the standard gcr mechanism these services provide certain customers with the opportunity to either lock in their gas cost or place a cap on the gas costs that would be charged in future months in order to hedge the anticipated physical purchases associated with these obligations forward physical contracts nymex futures and nymex options are used to secure forward gas prices the accounting treatment elected for these contracts is varied in that certain of these contracts have been accounted for as cash flow hedges while some contracts are not the accounting treatment is based on the election of the company the normal purchase and normal sales exception is elected for forward physical contracts associated with these programs where delivery of the commodity is probable to occurnipsco also offers a dependabill program to its customers as an alternative to the standard tariff rate that is charged to residential customers the program allows nipsco customers to fix their total monthly bill in future months at a flat rate regardless of gas usage or commodity cost in order to hedge the anticipated physical purchases associated with these obligations forward physical contracts nymex futures and nymex options have been used to secure forward gas prices the normal purchase and normal sales exception is elected for forward physical contracts associated with these programs where delivery of the commodity is probable to occurnipsco enters into gas purchase contracts at first of the month prices that give counterparties the daily option to either sell an additional package of gas at first of the month prices or recall the original volume to be delivered nipsco

which 1 has an insufficient amount of atrisk equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial subordinated support provided by any other parties 2 whose atrisk equity owners as a group do not have power through voting rights or similar rights to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance or 3 whose atrisk owners

procedure 201143 which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized this

tangible property regulations and the standdown position audit adjustment nisource determined that the unrecognized tax benefit associated with the requested change in tax accounting method filed for 2008 related to electric generation and gas transmission and distribution required a remeasurement under the provisions of asc 740 therefore in the fourth quarter of 2012 nisource recognized an income tax receivable of 857 million related to the 2008 and 2009 tax years and increases in net operating loss carryforwards of 68 million for the tax years 20102012 previously unrecognized except for

recorded an unrecognized tax benefit related to this uncertain tax position of 176 million in 2010 in 2011 this estimate was revised to 199 million in 2012 the irs completed fieldwork for the audit

ended december 31 2014 as of december 31 2012 it was reasonably possible that a 205 million decrease in unrecorded tax benefits could occur in 2013 due primarily to joint committee taxation review of

current rates of rateregulated companies include postretirement benefit costs including amortization of the regulatory assets that arose prior to inclusion of these costs in rates for most plans cash contributions are remitted to grantor trustsnisource pension and other postretirement benefit plans asset management nisource employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the longterm return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and asset class volatility the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments furthermore equity investments are diversified across us and nonus stocks as well as growth value small and large capitalizations other assets such as private equity funds are used judiciously to enhance longterm returns while improving portfolio diversification derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner however derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying assets investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews annual liability measurements and periodic assetliability studiesnisource utilizes a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing in determining the longterm rate of return for plan assets historical markets are studied and longterm historical relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed to ensure that they are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate greater return over the long run current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness the most important component of an investment strategy is the portfolio asset mix or the allocation between the various classes of securities available to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans for investment purposes the asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established for the nisource plan assets represents a longterm view and are listed in the following table in 2012 a dynamic asset allocation policy for the pension fund was approved this policy calls for a gradual reduction in the allocation to returnseeking assets equities real estate private equity and hedge funds and a corresponding increase in the allocation to liabilityhedging assets fixed income as the funded status of the plans increase above 90 as measured by the projected benefit obligations of the qualified pension plans divided by the market value of qualified pension plan assets the asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established by the

in the first quarter of 2012 the epa proposed an outputbased carbon standard for new power plants on september 20 2013 the epa announced withdrawal of the proposed standard and released a new proposal the newly proposed standard would for the first time set national limits on the amount of carbon emissions allowed from new power plants the revised numerical limit requires that compliance for new coalfired plants may need to include capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide in addition the epa stated that it intends to regulate existing sources with a proposed rule expected in 2014if the epa develops a ghg new source performance standard for existing units or if a federal or state comprehensive climate change bill were to be enacted into law the impact on nisources financial performance would depend on a number of factors including the overall level of required ghg reductions the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance and the amount of recovery allowed from customers comprehensive federal or state ghg regulation could result in additional expense or compliance costs that may not be fully recoverable from customers and could materially impact nisources financial
