profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this changing environment including providing gas customers with increased choices for products and servicesnatural gas competition open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or unbundling of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisources gas distribution operations subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from

financial conditionnisource had total consolidated indebtedness of 99994 million outstanding as of december 31 2014 the substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could limit the ability to borrow additional funds or increase the cost of borrowing additional fundsreduce the availability of cash flow from operations to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposeslimit the flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the business and the industries in which the company operateslead parties with whom nisource does business to require additional credit support such as letters of credit in order for nisource to transact such businessplace nisource at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that are less leveragedincrease vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions andlimit the ability of the company to execute on its growth strategy which is dependent upon access to capital to fund its substantial investment programsome of nisources debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions nisources failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations additionally a drop in nisources credit rating could adversely impact the cost for nisource to issue new debt securitiesa drop in nisources credit rating could adversely impact nisources liquiditythe announcement of the

ratings of its other rated subsidiaries fitchs outlook for nisource and its subsidiaries is stable although all ratings continue to be investment grade a downgrade by either standard amp poors or fitch would result in a rating that is below investment gradecertain nisource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below bbb by standard amp poors or baa3 by moodys these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 393 million in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business a credit downgrade could also adversely affect the availability and cost of capital needed to fund the growth investments that are a central element of nisources longterm business strategythese requirements combined with other potential negative effects on nisources liquidity in the event of a credit downgrade below an investment grade rating could have a material adverse effect on earnings potential and cash flows lastly a credit downgrade could adversely affect the availability and cost of capital needed to fund the growth investments which are a central element of the companys longterm business strategynisource may not be able to execute its growth strategy as plannedbecause of changes in the business or regulatory environment nisource may not be able to execute its business plan as intended nisources commercial and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results levels of commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business may be less than its plan has anticipated natural gas production activity including production facilitated by hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect nisources gas transmission storage and midstream business expansion opportunities and therefore the actual results of 10table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incnisources financial management of the balance sheet and process and expense management could deviate materially from planned outcomes in addition nisources growth plan relies on the continued view of natural gas as an economically and ecologically attractive fuel any developments that cause natural gas no longer to be seen as a favored fuel could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospectsadverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce net revenue growth increase costs decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and liquidity needswhile the national economy is experiencing some recovery from the recent downturn nisource cannot predict how robust the recovery will be or whether or not it will be sustainedcontinued sluggishness in the economy impacting nisources operating jurisdictions could adversely impact nisources ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs an increase in the interest rates nisource pays would adversely affect future net income and cash flows in addition nisource depends on debt to finance its operations including both working capital and capital expenditures and would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates if the current economic recovery remains slow or credit markets again tighten nisources ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at a reasonable cost could be negatively impacted refer to note 14 longterm debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debtcapital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earningsthe performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisources projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact nisources results of operations and financial positionthe majority of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedingsmost of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisources financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approvalas a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisources growth strategy and cash flows nisources costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the recognition of environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitabilitynisources subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste solid waste and coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisources facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisources subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to the environment or persons even 11table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incif caused by factors beyond nisources control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and its subsidiariesexisting environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to nisources subsidiaries revised or additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisources facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisources facilitiesbecause nisources operations deal with natural gas and coal fossil fuels emissions of ghgs are an expected aspect of the business while nisource attempts to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be entirely eliminated the current administration has made it clear that it is focused on reducing ghg emissions through legislation andor regulation imposing statutory or regulatory restrictions andor costs on ghg emissions could increase nisources cost of producing energy which could impact customer demand or nisources profitability compliance costs associated with these requirements could also affect nisources cash flow the cost impact of any new or amended ghg legislation or regulations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this timeeven in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known the original estimates for cleanup and environmental capital projects can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of contamination the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery from customers changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect nisources financial position operating results and cash flowsa significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly the operating results fluctuate depending on the weather and to a certain extent usage of gas or electricityenergy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisources financial results lastly residential and commercial customers usage has shown to be sensitive to economic conditions and the impact of macroeconomic drivers such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence which could also affect nisources financial resultsnisources business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industriesbusiness operations throughout nisources service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates in particular sales to large industrial customers may be impacted by economic downturns the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its productsfluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs may have a negative impact on nisources financial resultsnisources electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and its gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs hedging activities have been deployed in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices and nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner additionally increased gas and electricity costs could result in reduced demand from customers as a result of increased conservation activitiesnisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreementsnisources extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterpartys financial condition credit history and other factors credit risk exposure is monitored by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels 12table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incand also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies continued adverse economic conditions could increase credit risk and could result in a material adverse effect on nisourcenisource has significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earningsin accordance with gaap nisource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill also is tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable nisource would be required to record a charge in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements nisource is subject to a financial covenant under its fiveyear revolving credit facility and its term loans which requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75 as of december 31 2014 the ratio was 62changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect nisources financial resultsnisource is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where it does business legislation or regulation which could affect nisources tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities nisource cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which could have a negative impact on the financial results additionally nisource uses its best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations however a challenge by a taxing authority nisources ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimateschanges in accounting principles may adversely affect nisources financial resultsfuture changes in accounting rules and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the way nisource records revenues expenses assets and liabilities these changes in accounting standards may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations transportation and storage of natural gas as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costsnisources gas distribution and gas transmission and storage activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks such as gas leaks downed power lines accidents including thirdparty damages large scale outages and mechanical problems which could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and the general public significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of its operations adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm which in turn could lead to substantial losses to nisource in accordance with customary industry practice nisource maintains insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the location of pipelines and storage facilities or generation transmission substations and distribution facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect nisources financial position and results of operationsaging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact nisources financial resultsnisource has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement a higher level of maintenance costs and unscheduled outages despite diligent efforts by nisource to properly maintain these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in nisources inability to meet firm service obligations adversely impact revenues and result in increased capital expenditures and expenses which may not be fully

integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility nipsco also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects including airquality related improvements to its electric generating stations as well as the construction of new transmission facilities as nisource undertakes these projects it may not be able to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs additionally nisource may construct or purchase some of these projects to capture anticipated future growth in natural gas production which may not materialize and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time nisource also may not receive material increases in revenue and cash flows until after the completion of the projects 14table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incsustained extreme weather conditions may negatively impact nisources operationsnisource conducts its operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially extreme weather conditions which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time despite preventative maintenance efforts persistent weather related stress on nisources infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in its systems not previously known to the company or otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments although nisource makes every effort to plan for weather related contingencies adverse weather may affect its ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual obligations the company endeavors to minimize such service disruptions but may not be able to avoid them altogethergrowing competition in the gas transportation and storage industries could result in the failure by customers to renew existing contractsas a consequence of the increase in competition and the shift in natural gas production areas customers such as ldcs and other end users may be reluctant to enter into longterm service contracts the renewal or replacement of existing contracts with nisources customers at rates sufficient to maintain current or projected revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond its control including competition from other pipelines gatherers the proximity of supplies to the markets and the price of and demand for natural gas the inability of nisource to renew or replace its current contracts as they expire and respond appropriately to changing market conditions could materially impact its financial results and cash flowsnisource is a holding company and is dependent on cash generated by subsidiaries to meet its debt obligations and pay dividends on its common stocknisource is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries substantially all of nisources consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries accordingly nisources ability to meet its debt obligations or pay dividends on its common stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries in the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to nisource nisources ability to service its debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affectedfollowing the proposed separation all of the entities that make up nisources columbia pipeline group operations will be separated from nisource into a separately publicly traded company the related assets will no longer be held by subsidiaries of nisource which may negatively affect nisources ability to service its debt obligations or pay dividendsthe proposed separation may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits the proposed separation is subject to conditions including without limitation final nisource board of directors approval and the receipt by nisource of a legal opinion to the effect that the distribution of cpg shares to nisource stockholders will qualify as taxfree under section 355 of the us internal revenue code unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions may delay the proposed separation and the proposed separation may not occur on the currently contemplated timeline or at all nisource cannot predict with certainty when the benefits expected from the proposed separation will occur or the extent to which they will be achieved if at all furthermore there are various uncertainties and risks relating to the process of the proposed separation that could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows including disruption of our operations and impairment of our relationship with regulators key personnel customers and vendors if the proposed separation is successfully completed nisource will face new and unique risks including having fewer assets reduced financial resources and less diversification of revenue sources which may adversely impact nisources financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition the changes in our operational and financial profile may not meet some or all of our stockholders investment strategies which could cause investors to sell their nisource shares and otherwise decrease demand for shares of nisource common stock excess selling will cause the relative market price of nisource common stock to decrease and the market price of nisource common stock may be subject to greater volatility following the completion of the proposed separationa condition to the proposed separation is the receipt by nisource of a legal opinion to the effect that the distribution of cpg shares to nisource stockholders will qualify as taxfree under section 355 of the us internal revenue code however even if we receive such an opinion the internal revenue service could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable both nisource and our stockholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if taxing authorities conclude the distribution is taxable15table of

moodys investor service and fitch ratings inc ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating we may not initially receive such ratings or if received our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant there is no assurance that we will continue to maintain such investment grade credit ratings in the future if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our borrowing costs would increase

price columbia gulf and columbia transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contractsfirm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used the high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the columbia pipeline group operations segment due to changes in nearterm supply and demand conditions for the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 941 of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 40 of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 931 and 50 respectively for the year ended december 31 2013interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service these customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported the ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by

whose subsidiaries provide natural gas electricity and other products and services to approximately 39 million customers located within a corridor that runs from the gulf coast through the midwest to new england nisource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating results of its thirteen direct subsidiariesthe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nisource and its majorityowned subsidiaries after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions investments for which at least a 20 interest is owned certain joint ventures and limited partnership interests of more than 3 are accounted for under the equity method except where noted above and in the event where nisource has significant influence investments with less than a 20 interest are accounted for under the cost method nisource also consolidates variable interest entities for which nisource is the primary beneficiaryon september 28 2014 nisource announced that its board of directors had approved in principle plans to separate its natural gas pipeline and related businesses into a standalone publicly traded company the proposed separation if completed the proposed separation will result in two energy infrastructure companies nisource inc a fully regulated natural gas and electric utilities company and columbia pipeline group inc a natural gas pipeline midstream and storage company cpg the proposed separation is expected to occur in mid2015under the plan for the proposed separation nisource stockholders would retain their current shares of nisource stock and receive a pro rata distribution of shares of cpg stock in a transaction that is expected to be taxfree to nisource and its stockholdersb use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimatesc cash cash equivalents and restricted cash nisource considers all investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents nisource reports amounts deposited in brokerage accounts for margin requirements as restricted cash in addition nisource has amounts deposited in trust to satisfy requirements for the provision of various property liability workers compensation and longterm disability insurance which is classified as restricted cash and disclosed as an investing cash flow on the statements of consolidated cash flowsrestricted cash was 249 million and 80 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the increase in restricted cash was primarily a result of higher margin requirements due to open derivative contractsd accounts receivable and unbilled revenue accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts as nisource believes that total accounts receivable is a more meaningful presentation given the factors which impact both billed and unbilled accounts receivable unbilled revenue is based on estimated amounts of electric energy or natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its customers unbilled amounts of accounts receivable relate to a portion of a customers consumption of gas or electricity from the date of the last cycle billing date through the last day of the month balance sheet date factors taken into consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage customer rates and weather accounts receivable fluctuates from year to year depending in large part on weather impacts and price volatility nisources accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets includes unbilled revenue less reserves in the amounts of 3449 million and 3215 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the reserve for uncollectible receivables is the companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable the company determined the reserve based on historical experience and in consideration of current market conditions account balances are charged against the allowance when it is anticipated the receivable will not be recovered e investments in debt and equity securities nisources investments in debt and equity securities are carried at fair value and are designated as availableforsale these investments are included within other investments on the consolidated balance sheets unrealized gains and losses net of deferred income taxes are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income

in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and it is probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customersin the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for regulatory accounting in such an event a writedown of all or a portion of nisources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery was approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if unable to continue to apply the provisions of regulatory

circumstances would require an immediate review goodwill is tested for impairment using financial information at the reporting unit level which is consistent with the level of discrete financial information reviewed by operating segment management nisources three reporting units having goodwill assets are columbia distribution operations columbia transmission operations and nipsco gas distribution operationsnisources goodwill assets at december 31 2014 were 37 billion pertaining primarily to the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 of this amount approximately 20 billion is allocated to columbia transmission operations and 17 billion is allocated to columbia distribution operations in addition nipsco gas distribution operations goodwill assets of 178 million at december 31 2014 relate to the purchase of northern indiana fuel and light in march 1993 and kokomo gas in february 1992nisource completed a quantitative step 1 fair value measurement of its reporting units during the may 1 2012 goodwill test the test indicated that the fair value of each of the reporting units that carry or are allocated goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values indicating that no impairment existedin estimating the fair value of the columbia transmission operations and columbia distribution operations reporting units for the may 1 2012 test nisource used a weighted average of the income and market approaches the income approach utilized a discounted cash flow model this model was based on managements shortterm and longterm forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit the two main assumptions used in the models were the growth rates which were based on the cash flows from operations for each of the reporting units and the weighted average cost of capital or discount rate the starting point for each reporting units cash flow from operations was the detailed five year plan which takes into consideration a variety of factors such as the current economic environment industry trends and specific operating goals set by management the discount rates 72table of contentsnisource incnotes to consolidated financial statementsitem 8 financial statements and supplementary data continuedwere based on trends in overall market as well as industry specific variables and include components such as the riskfree rate cost of debt and company volatility at may 1 2012 under the market approach nisource utilized three marketbased models to estimate the fair value of the reporting units i the comparable company multiples method which estimated fair value of each reporting unit by analyzing ebitda multiples of a peer group of publicly traded companies and applying that multiple to the reporting units ebitda ii the comparable transactions method which valued the reporting unit based on observed ebitda multiples from completed transactions of peer companies and applying that multiple to the reporting units ebitda and iii the market capitalization method which used the nisource share price and allocated nisources total market capitalization among both the goodwill and nongoodwill reporting units based on the relative ebitda revenues and operating income of each reporting unit each of the three market approaches were calculated with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation firm using multiples and assumptions inherent in todays market the degree of judgment involved and reliability of inputs into each model were considered in weighting the various approaches the resulting estimate of fair value of the reporting units using the weighted average of the income and market approaches exceeded their carrying values indicating that no impairment exists under step 1 of the annual impairment testcertain key assumptions used in determining the fair values of the reporting units included planned operating results discount rates and the longterm outlook for growth in 2012 nisource used discount rates of 560 for both columbia transmission operations and columbia distribution operations resulting in excess fair values of approximately 16430 million and 16820 million respectively goodwill at nipsco gas distribution operations related to the acquisition of northern indiana fuel and light and kokomo gas of 178 million was also tested for impairment as of may 1 2012 the income approach was used to determine the fair value of the nipsco gas distribution reporting unit key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 560 and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations these cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives the step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the nipsco gas distribution reporting unit to be above the carrying value by 3560 millionasu 201108 allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative step 0 assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test if a step 0 assessment is performed an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that based on that assessment it is more likely than not that its fair values are less than its carrying amount nisource applied the qualitative step 0 analysis to its reporting units for the annual impairment tests performed as of may 1 2014 and 2013 nisource assessed various assumptions events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units as compared to its base line may 1 2012 step 1 fair value measurement the results of these assessments indicated that it is not more likely than not that its reporting unit fair values are less than the reporting unit carrying valuesnisource considered whether there were any events or changes in circumstances subsequent to the annual test that would reduce the fair value of any of the reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate another goodwill impairment test no such indicators were noted that would require goodwill impairment testing subsequent to may 1 2014during the first quarter of 2013 as part of the sale of the service plan and leasing business lines of its retail services business nisource allocated 100 million of goodwill from columbia distribution operations to the sale and

respectively the 21 increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2014 versus 2013 was primarily the result of a 71 million increase due to indiana state taxes discussed below 55 million pennsylvania regulatory changes discussed below and 41 million additional deferred state income tax related to corporate restructuringon march 25 2014 the governor of indiana signed into law senate bill 1 which among other things lowers the corporate income tax rate from 65 to 49 over six years beginning on july 1 2015 the reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the ratemaking process in addition other deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily deferred tax assets related to the indiana net operating loss carry forward will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized in the first quarter of 2014 nisource recorded tax expense of 71 million to reflect the effect of this rate change this expense is largely attributable to the remeasurement of the indiana net operating loss at the 49 rate the majority of nisources tax temporary differences are related to

having longer production periods before january 1 2016 the retroactive extension of the research credit did not have a significant effect on net incomeas a result of a pennsylvania puc order dated may 23 2013 columbia of pennsylvania adjusted the flow through in rates of tax benefits so that the unamortized balance of a change in accounting method for certain capitalized costs of approximately 82 million at june 30 2013 would be amortized through december 2016 the amortization of excess tax benefits was 95 million in 2013 and 40 million in 2014 on a prospective basis columbia of pennsylvania

treasury department and the irs issued temporary and proposed regulations effective for years beginning on or after january 1 2012 that among other things provided guidance on whether expenditures

and later incorporated by reference in the revenue agents report dated november 14 2012 for the 2008 to 2010 tax years nisource received an audit adjustment that adopted the standdown position the effect of this adjustment is to allow the repairs claims as filed and to defer review until a new method is adopted in 2012 or a subsequent acceptable year on november 20 2012 the treasury department and irs issued notice 201273 which in relevant part stated that i final regulations would be issued in 2013 and ii the final regulations will contain changes from the temporary regulations the notice in essence defers the requirement of adopting the temporary regulations until 2013 and the final regulations until 2014 on september 13 2013 the irs and us treasury issued final regulations on the deductibility and capitalization of expenditures related to tangible property generally effective for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2014 taxpayers may elect early adoption of the

whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the longterm return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and asset class volatility the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments furthermore equity investments are diversified across us and nonus stocks as well as growth value small and large capitalizations other assets such as private equity funds are used judiciously to enhance longterm returns while improving portfolio diversification derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner however derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying assets investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews annual liability measurements and periodic assetliability studiesnisource utilizes a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing in determining the longterm rate of return for plan assets historical markets are studied and longterm historical relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed to ensure that they are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate greater return over the long run current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness the most important component of an investment strategy is the portfolio asset mix or the allocation between the various classes of securities available to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans for investment purposes the asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established for the nisource plan assets represents a longterm view and are listed in the following table in 2012 a dynamic asset allocation policy for the pension fund was approved this policy calls for a gradual reduction in the allocation to returnseeking assets equities real estate private equity and hedge funds and a corresponding increase in the allocation to liabilityhedging assets fixed income as the

underfunded by 4211 million at december 31 2014 compared to being underfunded at december 31 2013 by 2609 million the decline in the funded status was due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate

in the carrying amount of the business lines in determining the gain on disposal the amount of the goodwill included in the carrying amount was based on the relative fair values of the business lines disposed of and the portion of the reporting units that were retained the fair value of the disposed business lines was determined by using the selling price of the business lines the fair value of the reporting units that were retained was determined by a weighted average of income and market approaches this approach was similar to the process undertaken to calculate the fair value of the reporting units for the goodwill impairment test conducted on may 1 2012 these approaches are further discussed in note 5 and yield fair values considered to be at level 3 of the fair value hierarchy

obligations on specific units final co2 emission rate standards are expected to be set by the epa by midsummer 2015 and state plans are required to be submitted to the epa as early as june 2016 the
