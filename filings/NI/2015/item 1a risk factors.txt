profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this changing environment including providing gas customers with increased choices for products and servicesnatural gas competition open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or unbundling of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisources gas distribution operations subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from

financial conditionnisource had total consolidated indebtedness of 99994 million outstanding as of december 31 2014 the substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could limit the ability to borrow additional funds or increase the cost of borrowing additional fundsreduce the availability of cash flow from operations to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposeslimit the flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the business and the industries in which the company operateslead parties with whom nisource does business to require additional credit support such as letters of credit in order for nisource to transact such businessplace nisource at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that are less leveragedincrease vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions andlimit the ability of the company to execute on its growth strategy which is dependent upon access to capital to fund its substantial investment programsome of nisources debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions nisources failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations additionally a drop in nisources credit rating could adversely impact the cost for nisource to issue new debt securitiesa drop in nisources credit rating could adversely impact nisources liquiditythe announcement of the

ratings of its other rated subsidiaries fitchs outlook for nisource and its subsidiaries is stable although all ratings continue to be investment grade a downgrade by either standard amp poors or fitch would result in a rating that is below investment gradecertain nisource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below bbb by standard amp poors or baa3 by moodys these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 393 million in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business a credit downgrade could also adversely affect the availability and cost of capital needed to fund the growth investments that are a central element of nisources longterm business strategythese requirements combined with other potential negative effects on nisources liquidity in the event of a credit downgrade below an investment grade rating could have a material adverse effect on earnings potential and cash flows lastly a credit downgrade could adversely affect the availability and cost of capital needed to fund the growth investments which are a central element of the companys longterm business strategynisource may not be able to execute its growth strategy as plannedbecause of changes in the business or regulatory environment nisource may not be able to execute its business plan as intended nisources commercial and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results levels of commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business may be less than its plan has anticipated natural gas production activity including production facilitated by hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect nisources gas transmission storage and midstream business expansion opportunities and therefore the actual results of 10table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incnisources financial management of the balance sheet and process and expense management could deviate materially from planned outcomes in addition nisources growth plan relies on the continued view of natural gas as an economically and ecologically attractive fuel any developments that cause natural gas no longer to be seen as a favored fuel could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospectsadverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce net revenue growth increase costs decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and liquidity needswhile the national economy is experiencing some recovery from the recent downturn nisource cannot predict how robust the recovery will be or whether or not it will be sustainedcontinued sluggishness in the economy impacting nisources operating jurisdictions could adversely impact nisources ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs an increase in the interest rates nisource pays would adversely affect future net income and cash flows in addition nisource depends on debt to finance its operations including both working capital and capital expenditures and would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates if the current economic recovery remains slow or credit markets again tighten nisources ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at a reasonable cost could be negatively impacted refer to note 14 longterm debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debtcapital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earningsthe performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisources projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact nisources results of operations and financial positionthe majority of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedingsmost of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisources financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approvalas a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisources growth strategy and cash flows nisources costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the recognition of environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitabilitynisources subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste solid waste and coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisources facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisources subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to the environment or persons even 11table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incif caused by factors beyond nisources control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and its subsidiariesexisting environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to nisources subsidiaries revised or additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisources facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisources facilitiesbecause nisources operations deal with natural gas and coal fossil fuels emissions of ghgs are an expected aspect of the business while nisource attempts to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be entirely eliminated the current administration has made it clear that it is focused on reducing ghg emissions through legislation andor regulation imposing statutory or regulatory restrictions andor costs on ghg emissions could increase nisources cost of producing energy which could impact customer demand or nisources profitability compliance costs associated with these requirements could also affect nisources cash flow the cost impact of any new or amended ghg legislation or regulations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this timeeven in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known the original estimates for cleanup and environmental capital projects can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of contamination the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery from customers changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect nisources financial position operating results and cash flowsa significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly the operating results fluctuate depending on the weather and to a certain extent usage of gas or electricityenergy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisources financial results lastly residential and commercial customers usage has shown to be sensitive to economic conditions and the impact of macroeconomic drivers such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence which could also affect nisources financial resultsnisources business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industriesbusiness operations throughout nisources service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates in particular sales to large industrial customers may be impacted by economic downturns the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its productsfluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs may have a negative impact on nisources financial resultsnisources electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and its gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs hedging activities have been deployed in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices and nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner additionally increased gas and electricity costs could result in reduced demand from customers as a result of increased conservation activitiesnisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreementsnisources extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterpartys financial condition credit history and other factors credit risk exposure is monitored by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels 12table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incand also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies continued adverse economic conditions could increase credit risk and could result in a material adverse effect on nisourcenisource has significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earningsin accordance with gaap nisource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill also is tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable nisource would be required to record a charge in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements nisource is subject to a financial covenant under its fiveyear revolving credit facility and its term loans which requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75 as of december 31 2014 the ratio was 62changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect nisources financial resultsnisource is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where it does business legislation or regulation which could affect nisources tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities nisource cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which could have a negative impact on the financial results additionally nisource uses its best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations however a challenge by a taxing authority nisources ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimateschanges in accounting principles may adversely affect nisources financial resultsfuture changes in accounting rules and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the way nisource records revenues expenses assets and liabilities these changes in accounting standards may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations transportation and storage of natural gas as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costsnisources gas distribution and gas transmission and storage activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks such as gas leaks downed power lines accidents including thirdparty damages large scale outages and mechanical problems which could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and the general public significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of its operations adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm which in turn could lead to substantial losses to nisource in accordance with customary industry practice nisource maintains insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the location of pipelines and storage facilities or generation transmission substations and distribution facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect nisources financial position and results of operationsaging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact nisources financial resultsnisource has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement a higher level of maintenance costs and unscheduled outages despite diligent efforts by nisource to properly maintain these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in nisources inability to meet firm service obligations adversely impact revenues and result in increased capital expenditures and expenses which may not be fully

risks related to fluctuation in construction and gas costs both modernization and expansion projects are reliant on the contractual performance of vendors and suppliers of materials and supplies and services nonperformance or underperformance could subject nisource to increased costs further nisource is subject to regulatory approval of various projects delays in this process could increase costs of the projectsnisource competes for these projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities including some that may have advantages competing for natural gas and liquid gas supplies as well as acquisitions and other business opportunities similarly nisource gas distribution operations is engaged in an intrastate natural gas pipeline modernization program to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility nipsco also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects including airquality related improvements to its electric generating stations as well as the construction of new transmission facilities as nisource undertakes these projects it may not be able to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs additionally nisource may construct or purchase some of these projects to capture anticipated future growth in natural gas production which may not materialize and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time nisource also may not receive material increases in revenue and cash flows until after the completion of the projects 14table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incsustained extreme weather conditions may negatively impact nisources operationsnisource conducts its operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially extreme weather conditions which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time despite preventative maintenance efforts persistent weather related stress on nisources infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in its systems not previously known to the company or otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments although nisource makes every effort to plan for weather related contingencies adverse weather may affect its ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual obligations the company endeavors to minimize such service disruptions but may not be able to avoid them altogethergrowing competition in the gas transportation and storage industries could result in the failure by customers to renew existing contractsas a consequence of the increase in competition and the shift in natural gas production areas customers such as ldcs and other end users may be reluctant to enter into longterm service contracts the renewal or replacement of existing contracts with nisources customers at rates sufficient to maintain current or projected revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond its control including competition from other pipelines gatherers the proximity of supplies to the markets and the price of and demand for natural gas the inability of nisource to renew or replace its current contracts as they expire and respond appropriately to changing market conditions could materially impact its financial results and cash flowsnisource is a holding company and is dependent on cash generated by subsidiaries to meet its debt obligations and pay dividends on its common stocknisource is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries substantially all of nisources consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries accordingly nisources ability to meet its debt obligations or pay dividends on its common stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries in the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to nisource nisources ability to service its debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affectedfollowing the proposed separation all of the entities that make up nisources columbia pipeline group operations will be separated from nisource into a separately publicly traded company the related assets will no longer be held by subsidiaries of nisource which may negatively affect nisources ability to service its debt obligations or pay dividendsthe proposed separation may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits the proposed separation is subject to conditions including without limitation final nisource board of directors approval and the receipt by nisource of a legal opinion to the effect that the distribution of cpg shares to nisource stockholders will qualify as taxfree under section 355 of the us internal revenue code unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions may delay the proposed separation and the proposed separation may not occur on the currently contemplated timeline or at all nisource cannot predict with certainty when the benefits expected from the proposed separation will occur or the extent to which they will be achieved if at all furthermore there are various uncertainties and risks relating to the process of the proposed separation that could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows including disruption of our operations and impairment of our relationship with regulators key personnel customers and vendors if the proposed separation is successfully completed nisource will face new and unique risks including having fewer assets reduced financial resources and less diversification of revenue sources which may adversely impact nisources financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition the changes in our operational and financial profile may not meet some or all of our stockholders investment strategies which could cause investors to sell their nisource shares and otherwise decrease demand for shares of nisource common stock excess selling will cause the relative market price of nisource common stock to decrease and the market price of nisource common stock may be subject to greater volatility following the completion of the proposed separationa condition to the proposed separation is the receipt by nisource of a legal opinion to the effect that the distribution of cpg shares to nisource stockholders will qualify as taxfree under section 355 of the us internal revenue code however even if we receive such an opinion the internal revenue service could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable both nisource and our stockholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if taxing authorities conclude the distribution is taxable15table of

moodys investor service and fitch ratings inc ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating we may not initially receive such ratings or if received our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant there is no assurance that we will continue to maintain such investment grade credit ratings in the future if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease in addition a failure by us to maintain an investment grade rating could affect our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners see a drop in nisources credit rating could adversely impact nisources liquidity above
