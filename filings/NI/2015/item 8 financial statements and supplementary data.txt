whose subsidiaries provide natural gas electricity and other products and services to approximately 39 million customers located within a corridor that runs from the gulf coast through the midwest to new england nisource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating results of its thirteen direct subsidiariesthe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nisource and its majorityowned subsidiaries after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions investments for which at least a 20 interest is owned certain joint ventures and limited partnership interests of more than 3 are accounted for under the equity method except where noted above and in the event where nisource has significant influence investments with less than a 20 interest are accounted for under the cost method nisource also consolidates variable interest entities for which nisource is the primary beneficiaryon september 28 2014 nisource announced that its board of directors had approved in principle plans to separate its natural gas pipeline and related businesses into a standalone publicly traded company the proposed separation if completed the proposed separation will result in two energy infrastructure companies nisource inc a fully regulated natural gas and electric utilities company and columbia pipeline group inc a natural gas pipeline midstream and storage company cpg the proposed separation is expected to occur in mid2015under the plan for the proposed separation nisource stockholders would retain their current shares of nisource stock and receive a pro rata distribution of shares of cpg stock in a transaction that is expected to be taxfree to nisource and its stockholdersb use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimatesc cash cash equivalents and restricted cash nisource considers all investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents nisource reports amounts deposited in brokerage accounts for margin requirements as restricted cash in addition nisource has amounts deposited in trust to satisfy requirements for the provision of various property liability workers compensation and longterm disability insurance which is classified as restricted cash and disclosed as an investing cash flow on the statements of consolidated cash flowsrestricted cash was 249 million and 80 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the increase in restricted cash was primarily a result of higher margin requirements due to open derivative contractsd accounts receivable and unbilled revenue accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts as nisource believes that total accounts receivable is a more meaningful presentation given the factors which impact both billed and unbilled accounts receivable unbilled revenue is based on estimated amounts of electric energy or natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its customers unbilled amounts of accounts receivable relate to a portion of a customers consumption of gas or electricity from the date of the last cycle billing date through the last day of the month balance sheet date factors taken into consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage customer rates and weather accounts receivable fluctuates from year to year depending in large part on weather impacts and price volatility nisources accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets includes unbilled revenue less reserves in the amounts of 3449 million and 3215 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the reserve for uncollectible receivables is the companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable the company determined the reserve based on historical experience and in consideration of current market conditions account balances are charged against the allowance when it is anticipated the receivable will not be recovered e investments in debt and equity securities nisources investments in debt and equity securities are carried at fair value and are designated as availableforsale these investments are included within other investments on the consolidated balance sheets unrealized gains and losses net of deferred income taxes are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income

in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and it is probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customersin the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the

circumstances would require an immediate review goodwill is tested for impairment using financial information at the reporting unit level which is consistent with the level of discrete financial information reviewed by operating segment management nisources three reporting units having goodwill assets are columbia distribution operations columbia transmission operations and nipsco gas distribution operationsnisources goodwill assets at december 31 2014 were 37 billion pertaining primarily to the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 of this amount approximately 20 billion is allocated to columbia transmission operations and 17 billion is allocated to columbia distribution operations in addition nipsco gas distribution operations goodwill assets of 178 million at december 31 2014 relate to the purchase of northern indiana fuel and light in march 1993 and kokomo gas in february 1992nisource completed a quantitative step 1 fair value measurement of its reporting units during the may 1 2012 goodwill test the test indicated that the fair value of each of the reporting units that carry or are allocated goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values indicating that no impairment existedin estimating the fair value of the columbia transmission operations and columbia distribution operations reporting units for the may 1 2012 test nisource used a weighted average of the income and market approaches the income approach utilized a discounted cash flow model this model was based on managements shortterm and longterm forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit the two main assumptions used in the models were the growth rates which were based on the cash flows from operations for each of the reporting units and the weighted average cost of capital or discount rate the starting point for each reporting units cash flow from operations was the detailed five year plan which takes into consideration a variety of factors such as the current economic environment industry trends and specific operating goals set by management the discount rates 72table of contentsnisource incnotes to consolidated financial statementsitem 8 financial statements and supplementary data continuedwere based on trends in overall market as well as industry specific variables and include components such as the riskfree rate cost of debt and company volatility at may 1 2012 under the market approach nisource utilized three marketbased models to estimate the fair value of the reporting units i the comparable company multiples method which estimated fair value of each reporting unit by analyzing ebitda multiples of a peer group of publicly traded companies and applying that multiple to the reporting units ebitda ii the comparable transactions method which valued the reporting unit based on observed ebitda multiples from completed transactions of peer companies and applying that multiple to the reporting units ebitda and iii the market capitalization method which used the nisource share price and allocated nisources total market capitalization among both the goodwill and nongoodwill reporting units based on the relative ebitda revenues and operating income of each reporting unit each of the three market approaches were calculated with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation firm using multiples and assumptions inherent in todays market the degree of judgment involved and reliability of inputs into each model were considered in weighting the various approaches the resulting estimate of fair value of the reporting units using the weighted average of the income and market approaches exceeded their carrying values indicating that no impairment exists under step 1 of the annual impairment testcertain key assumptions used in determining the fair values of the reporting units included planned operating results discount rates and the longterm outlook for growth in 2012 nisource used discount rates of 560 for both columbia transmission operations and columbia distribution operations resulting in excess fair values of approximately 16430 million and 16820 million respectively goodwill at nipsco gas distribution operations related to the acquisition of northern indiana fuel and light and kokomo gas of 178 million was also tested for impairment as of may 1 2012 the income approach was used to determine the fair value of the nipsco gas distribution reporting unit key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 560 and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations these cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives the step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the nipsco gas distribution reporting unit to be above the carrying value by 3560 millionasu 201108 allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative step 0 assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test if a step 0 assessment is performed an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that based on that assessment it is more likely than not that its fair values are less than its carrying amount nisource applied the qualitative step 0 analysis to its reporting units for the annual impairment tests performed as of may 1 2014 and 2013 nisource assessed various assumptions events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units as compared to its base line may 1 2012 step 1 fair value measurement the results of these assessments indicated that it is not more likely than not that its reporting unit fair values are less than the reporting unit carrying valuesnisource considered whether there were any events or changes in circumstances subsequent to the annual test that would reduce the fair value of any of the reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate another goodwill impairment test no such indicators were noted that would require goodwill impairment testing subsequent to may 1 2014during the first quarter of 2013 as part of the sale of the service plan and leasing business lines of its retail services business nisource allocated 100 million of goodwill from columbia distribution operations to the sale and

regulatory changes discussed below and 41 million additional deferred state income tax related to corporate restructuringon march 25 2014 the governor of indiana signed into law senate bill 1 which among other things lowers the corporate income tax rate from 65 to 49 over six years beginning on july 1 2015 the reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the ratemaking process in addition other deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily deferred tax assets related to the indiana net operating loss carry forward will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized in the first quarter of 2014 nisource recorded tax expense of 71 million to reflect the effect of this rate change this expense is largely attributable to the remeasurement of the indiana net operating loss at the 49 rate the majority of nisources tax temporary differences are related to

23 2013 columbia of pennsylvania adjusted the flow through in rates of tax benefits so that the unamortized balance of a change in accounting method for certain capitalized costs of approximately 82 million at june 30 2013 would be amortized through december 2016 the amortization of excess tax benefits was 95 million in 2013 and 40 million in 2014 on a prospective basis columbia of pennsylvania

treasury department and the irs issued temporary and proposed regulations effective for years beginning on or after january 1 2012 that among other things provided guidance on whether expenditures

and later incorporated by reference in the revenue agents report dated november 14 2012 for the 2008 to 2010 tax years nisource received an audit adjustment that adopted the standdown position the effect of this adjustment is to allow the repairs claims as filed and to defer review until a new method is adopted in 2012 or a subsequent acceptable year on november 20 2012 the treasury department and irs issued notice 201273 which in relevant part stated that i final regulations would be issued in 2013 and ii the final regulations will contain changes from the temporary regulations the notice in essence defers the requirement of adopting the temporary regulations until 2013 and the final regulations until 2014 on september 13 2013 the irs and us treasury issued final regulations on the deductibility and capitalization of expenditures related to tangible property generally effective for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2014 taxpayers may elect early adoption of the

whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the longterm return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and asset class volatility the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments furthermore equity investments are diversified across us and nonus stocks as well as growth value small and large capitalizations other assets such as private equity funds are used judiciously to enhance longterm returns while improving portfolio diversification derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner however derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying assets investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews annual liability measurements and periodic assetliability studiesnisource utilizes a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing in determining the longterm rate of return for plan assets historical markets are studied and longterm historical relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed to ensure that they are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate greater return over the long run current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness the most important component of an investment strategy is the portfolio asset mix or the allocation between the various classes of securities available to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans for investment purposes the asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established for the nisource plan assets represents a longterm view and are listed in the following table in 2012 a dynamic asset allocation policy for the pension fund was approved this policy calls for a gradual reduction in the allocation to returnseeking assets equities real estate private equity and hedge funds and a corresponding increase in the allocation to liabilityhedging assets fixed income as the

lossnisources accumulated benefit obligation for its pension plans was 27323 million and 25119 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the accumulated benefit obligation as of a date is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered prior to that date and based on current and past compensation levels the accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation disclosed in the table above in that it includes no assumptions about future compensation levels nisource pension plans were underfunded by 4211 million at december 31 2014 compared to being underfunded at december 31 2013 by 2609 million the decline in the funded status was due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate

in the carrying amount of the business lines in determining the gain on disposal the amount of the goodwill included in the carrying amount was based on the relative fair values of the business lines disposed of and the portion of the reporting units that were retained the fair value of the disposed business lines was determined by using the selling price of the business lines the fair value of the reporting units that were retained was determined by a weighted average of income and market approaches this approach was similar to the process undertaken to calculate the fair value of the reporting units for the goodwill impairment test conducted on may 1 2012 these approaches are further discussed in note 5 and yield fair values considered to be at level 3 of the fair value hierarchy

obligations on specific units final co2 emission rate standards are expected to be set by the epa by midsummer 2015 and state plans are required to be submitted to the epa as early as june 2016 the
