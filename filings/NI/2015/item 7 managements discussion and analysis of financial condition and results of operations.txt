material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business a credit downgrade could also adversely affect the availability and cost of capital needed to fund the growth investments that are a central element of nisources longterm business strategythese requirements combined with other potential negative

activity including production facilitated by hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect nisources gas transmission storage and midstream business expansion opportunities and therefore the actual results of 10table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incnisources financial management of the balance sheet and process and expense management could deviate materially from planned outcomes in addition nisources growth plan relies on the continued view of natural gas as an economically and ecologically attractive fuel any developments that cause natural gas no longer to be seen as a favored fuel could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospectsadverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce net revenue growth increase costs decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and liquidity needswhile the national economy is experiencing some recovery from the recent downturn nisource cannot predict how robust the recovery will be or whether or not it will be sustainedcontinued sluggishness in the economy impacting nisources operating jurisdictions could adversely impact nisources ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs an increase in the interest rates nisource pays would adversely affect future net income and cash flows in addition nisource depends on debt to finance its operations including both working capital and capital expenditures and would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates if the current economic recovery remains slow or credit markets again tighten nisources ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at a reasonable cost could be negatively impacted refer to note 14 longterm debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debtcapital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earningsthe performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisources projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact nisources results of operations and financial positionthe majority of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedingsmost of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisources financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approvalas a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisources growth strategy and cash flows nisources costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the recognition of environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitabilitynisources subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste solid waste and coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisources facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisources subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to the environment or persons even 11table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incif caused by factors beyond nisources control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and its subsidiariesexisting environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to nisources subsidiaries revised or additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisources facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisources facilitiesbecause nisources operations deal with natural gas and coal fossil fuels emissions of ghgs are an expected aspect of the business while nisource attempts to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be entirely eliminated the current administration has made it clear that it is focused on reducing ghg emissions through legislation andor regulation imposing statutory or regulatory restrictions andor costs on ghg emissions could increase nisources cost of producing energy which could impact customer demand or nisources profitability compliance costs associated with these requirements could also affect nisources cash flow the cost impact of any new or amended ghg legislation or regulations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this timeeven in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known the original estimates for cleanup and environmental capital projects can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of contamination the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery from customers changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect nisources financial position operating results and cash flowsa significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly the operating results fluctuate depending on the weather and to a certain extent usage of gas or electricityenergy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisources financial results lastly residential and commercial customers usage has shown to be sensitive to economic conditions and the impact of macroeconomic drivers such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence which could also affect nisources financial resultsnisources business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industriesbusiness operations throughout nisources service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates in particular sales to large industrial customers may be impacted by economic downturns the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its productsfluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs may have a negative impact on nisources financial resultsnisources electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and its gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs hedging activities have been deployed in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices and nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner additionally increased gas and electricity costs could result in reduced demand from customers as a result of increased conservation activitiesnisource

goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill also is tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable nisource would be required to record a charge in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements nisource is subject to a financial covenant under its fiveyear revolving credit facility and its term loans which requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a

business legislation or regulation which could affect nisources tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities nisource cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which could have a negative impact on the financial results additionally nisource uses its best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations however a challenge by a taxing authority nisources ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to

result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power to manage this market risk nisources subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps and options nisource is not involved in speculative energy trading activitycommodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at nisources rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments if states should explore additional regulatory reform these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk some of nisources rateregulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to its customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products these subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness nisource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts the amount of these deposits which are reflected in nisources restricted cash balance may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity marketsthere are no material commodity price risk assets or liabilities as of december 31 2014 and 2013interest rate risknisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement term loan commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased or decreased interest expense by 200 million and 142 million for the years 2014 and 2013 respectively credit

management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation efforts exposures to credit risks are monitored by the corporate credit risk function which is independent of commercial operations credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for derivative related contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase

accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on nisources results of operations and consolidated balance sheetsbasis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries asc topic 980 regulated operations provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 18899 million and 17362 million at december 31 2014 and 16650 million and 17300 million at december 31 2013 respectively for additional information refer to note 7

price columbia gulf and columbia transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contractsfirm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used the high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the columbia pipeline group operations segment due to changes in nearterm supply and demand conditions for the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 941 of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 40 of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 931 and 50 respectively for the year ended december 31 2013interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service these customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported the ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by
