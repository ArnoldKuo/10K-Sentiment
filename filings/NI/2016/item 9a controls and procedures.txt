price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power to manage this market risk nisources subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps and options nisource is not involved in speculative energy trading activitycommodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at nisources rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments if states should explore additional regulatory reform these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk some of nisources rateregulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to its customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products these subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness nisource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts the amount of these deposits which are reflected in nisources restricted cash balance may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity marketsthere are no material commodity price risk assets or liabilities as of december 31

hedge the interest rate risk related to forecasted issuances of longtermdebt based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase

for derivative related contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to nisource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and

liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities availableforsale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligationexchangetraded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within level 1 these financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations certain nonexchangetraded derivatives are valued using broker or overthecounter online exchanges in such cases these nonexchangetraded derivatives are classified within level 2 nonexchangebased derivative instruments include swaps forwards and options in certain instances nisource may utilize models to measure fair value valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and marketcorroborated inputs ie inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability the instrument is categorized in level 2 certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation when such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value the instrument is categorized in level 3 credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchangetraded credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposuresprice risk management liabilities also include forward starting interestrate swaps which are designated as cash flow hedges each period the swap instrument will be measured assuming a hypothetical settlement at that point in time upon termination

municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service areas as well as other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and other alternate fuels such as propane and fuel oil gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity has traditionally been the strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia due to comparatively low electric rates natural gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which has comprised a declining percentage of the

a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered gas cost to be included in future customer billingsthe gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory the sale of products and services in the companies service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such situations as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and their ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers certain gas distribution operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities where customers can choose to purchase gas from a thirdparty

usage for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased from the same period last year primarily due to warmer weather compared to the prior year while historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge operating costs are largely incurred on a fixed basis and do not fluctuate due to

insurance which is classified as restricted cash and disclosed as an investing cash flow on the statements of consolidated cash flowsrestricted cash was 297 million and 249 million as of december 31

receivable on the consolidated balance sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts as nisource believes that total accounts receivable is a more meaningful presentation given the factors which impact both billed and unbilled accounts receivable unbilled revenue is based on estimated amounts of electric energy or natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its customers unbilled amounts of accounts receivable relate to a portion of a customers consumption of gas or electricity from the date of the last cycle billing date through the last day of the month balance sheet date factors taken into consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage customer rates and weather accounts receivable fluctuates from year to year depending in large part on weather impacts and

serve customers certain operating costs of the nisource distribution companies are significant recurring in nature and generally outside the control of the distribution companies some states allow the recovery of such costs via cost tracking mechanisms such tracking mechanisms allow for abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the distribution companies to implement charges and recover

employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the longterm return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and asset class volatility the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments furthermore equity investments are diversified across us and nonus stocks as well as growth value small and large capitalizations other assets such as private equity funds are used judiciously to enhance longterm returns while improving portfolio diversification derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner however derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying assets investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews annual liability measurements and periodic assetliability studiesnisource utilizes a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing in determining the longterm rate of return for plan assets historical markets are studied and longterm historical relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed to ensure that they are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate greater return over the long run current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness the most important component of an investment strategy is the portfolio asset mix or the allocation between the various classes of securities available to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans for investment purposes the asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established for the nisource plan assets represents a longterm view and are listed in the table below in 2012 a dynamic asset allocation policy for the pension fund was approved this policy calls for a gradual reduction in the allocation to returnseeking assets equities real estate private equity and hedge funds and a corresponding increase in the allocation to liabilityhedging assets fixed income

the noncurrent portion is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets nisource accrues for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the original estimates for cleanup may differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including currently enacted laws and regulations the nature and extent of contamination the method of cleanup and the availability of cost recovery these

predecessors may have liability the program has identified 64 such sites where liability is probable remedial actions at many of these sites are being overseen by state or federal environmental agencies through consent agreements or voluntary remediation agreementsnisource utilizes a probabilistic model to estimate its future remediation costs related to its mgp sites the model was prepared with the assistance of a thirdparty and incorporates nisource and general industry experience with remediating mgp sites nisource completes an annual refresh of the model in the second quarter of each fiscal year no material changes to the estimated future remediation costs were noted as a result of the refresh completed as of june 30 2015 the total estimated liability at nisource related to the facilities subject to remediation was 1104 million and 1215 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the liability represents nisources best estimate of the probable cost to remediate the

to its electric generating stations the cost of capital improvements associated with the nsr consent decree and mats is estimated to be 860 million of which approximately 288 million remains to be

section 111d of the caa the final rule establishes national co2 emissionrate standards that are applied to each states mix of affected egus to establish statespecific emissionrate and massemission limits the final rule requires each state to submit a plan indicating how the state will meet the epas emissionrate or massemission limit including possibly imposing reduction obligations on specific units if a state does not submit a satisfactory plan the epa will impose a federal plan on that state on february 9 2016 the us supreme court stayed implementation of the cpp until litigation is decided on its merits the cost to comply with this rule will depend on a number of factors including the outcome of cpp litigation the requirements of the state plan or final federal plan and the level of nipscos required co2 emission reductions it is possible that this new rule comprehensive federal or state ghg legislation or other ghg regulation could result in additional expense or compliance costs that could materially impact nisources financial results nipsco will continue to monitor this matter and cannot estimate its impact at this timecross state air pollution rule on december 3 2015 the epa issued a proposed rule to address interstate air quality impacts associated with the 2008 ozone naaqs and also in response to a court mandate requiring the recalculation of downwind contributions of nox to states abilities to meet the ozone naaqs under the proposed recalculation nipsco may be required to meet a more stringent nox emission allocation associated with its already wellcontrolled units nipsco will continue to monitor this matter and cannot estimate its impact at this timewateron august 15 2014 the epa issued the final phase ii rule of the clean water act section 316b which requires all large existing steam electric generating stations to meet certain performance standards to reduce the effects on aquatic organisms at their cooling water intake structures under this rule stations will have to either demonstrate that the performance of their existing fish protection systems meet the new standards or develop new systems such as a closedcycle cooling tower the cost to comply will depend on a number of factors including evaluation of the various compliance options available under the regulation and permittingrelated determinations by idem nipsco estimates that the cost of compliance is between 4 million and 35 million dependent upon study results agency requirements and technology ultimately required to achieve complianceon november 3

them to be nonhazardous the rule will require increased groundwater monitoring reporting record keeping and posting of related information to the internet the rule also establishes requirements related to ccr management impoundments landfills and storage the rule will allow nipsco to continue its byproduct beneficial use programthe publication of the ccr rule resulted in revisions to previously recorded legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain nipsco facilities the actual asset retirement costs related to the ccr rule may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased asset retirement obligation due to the uncertainty about the compliance strategies that will be used and the preliminary nature of available data used to estimate costs
