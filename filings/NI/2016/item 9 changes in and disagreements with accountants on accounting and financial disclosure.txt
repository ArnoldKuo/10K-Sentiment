profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this environment including providing gas customers with increased choices for products and servicesnatural gas competition open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers can purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or unbundling of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs

price of the companys common stock nisource has substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial conditionnisource had total consolidated indebtedness of 69496 million outstanding as of december 31 2015 the companys substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it couldlimit the companys ability to borrow additional funds or increase the cost of borrowing additional fundsreduce the availability of cash flow from operations to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposeslimit the companys flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the business and the industries in which it operateslead parties with whom nisource does business to require additional credit support such as letters of credit in order for nisource to transact such businessplace nisource at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that are less leveragedincrease vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions andlimit the ability of the company to execute on its growth strategy which is dependent upon access to capital to fund its substantial investment programsome of nisources debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions nisources failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations a drop in nisources credit rating could adversely impact nisources liquidity the credit rating agencies periodically review the companys ratings taking into account factors such as our capital structure and earnings profile in 2015 moodys affirmed the nisource senior unsecured rating of baa2 and its commercial paper rating of p2 with stable outlooks moodys also affirmed nipscos baa1 rating and columbia gas of massachusettss baa2 rating with stable outlooks in 2015 standard amp poors raised the

commercial paper rating of f3 and the existing ratings of its other rated subsidiaries fitch revised its outlook to positive the company is committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings however there is no assurance we will be able to do so in the future the companys credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant any negative rating action could adversely affect our ability to access capital at rates and on terms that are attractive a negative rating action could also adversely impact our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners certain nisource subsidiaries have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are below investment grade these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power as of december 31 2015 the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 269 million in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact businessnisource may not be able to execute its business plan or growth strategy including utility infrastructure investmentsbusiness or regulatory conditions may result in nisource not being able to execute its business plan or growth strategy including identified planned and other utility infrastructure investments nisources customer and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results utility infrastructure investments may not materialize may cease to be achievable or economically viable and may not be successfully completed natural gas may cease to be viewed as an economically and

market conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce net revenue growth increase costs decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and liquidity needswhile the national economy is experiencing modest growth nisource cannot predict how robust future growth will be or whether or not it will be sustained deteriorating or sluggish economic conditions in nisources operating jurisdictions could adversely impact nisources ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs the company relies on access to the capital markets to finance our liquidity and longterm capital requirements market turmoil could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at reasonable borrowing costs and terms reduced access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows refer to note 14 longterm debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debtcapital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earningsthe performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisources projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension or other postretirement benefit plan expense could negatively impact nisources results of operations and financial positionthe majority of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedingsmost of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisources financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approvalas a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisources growth strategy and financial positionnisources costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the costs associated with environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitabilitynisource is subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste solid waste and coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisources facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisource fails to comply with environmental laws and regulations or is found to have caused damage to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisources control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisourceexisting environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to increase environmental regulation of the energy industry may be adopted or become applicable to nisource revised or additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisources facilities or increased compliance costs 9table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource incwhich may not be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisources facilitieseven in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known or anticipated the original cost estimates for cleanup and environmental capital projects can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of impact the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect nisources financial position operating results and cash flows because nisource operates fossil fuel facilities emissions of ghgs are an expected aspect of the business while nisource continues to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be eliminated the epa has made clear that it is focused on reducing ghg emissions from the energy industry on october 18 2015 the epa finalized its cpp which regulates greenhouse gas emissions from coal and natural gas electric generating units the cpp is subject to various legal challenges but if the cpp survives these challenges the compliance costs associated with cpp requirements could impact cash flow in addition the cpp could increase nisources cost of producing energy which may impact customer demand andor nisources profitability the cpp requires states or in some cases the epa to develop individualized plans to meet the cpp emission reduction requirements depending on the array of programs chosen by the state of indiana or epa nisources cpp compliance costs could be substantial it is also possible that additional future ghg legislation andor regulation could materially impact nisource the cost impact of any new andor amended ghg legislation or regulations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this timea significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly fluctuations in weather gas and electricity commodity costs and economic conditions impact demand of our customers and our operating resultsenergy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisources financial results lastly residential and commercial customers usage is sensitive to economic conditions and factors such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence therefore prevailing economic conditions may affect nisources financial resultsnisources business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industriesbusiness operations throughout nisources service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates in particular sales to large industrial customers such as those in the steel oil refining industrial gas and related industries may be impacted by economic downturns the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its productsfluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs may have a negative impact on nisources financial resultsnisources electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and its gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs from time to time nisource has used hedging in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the commodity costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely mannernisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreementsnisources extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterpartys financial condition credit history and other factors nisource monitors its credit risk exposure by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties by reference to marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing 10table of contentsitem 1a risk factorsnisource inclevels and to traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies adverse economic conditions could result in an increase in defaults by customers suppliers and counterpartiesnisource has significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings and negatively impact nisources compliance with certain covenants under financing agreementsin accordance with gaap nisource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill also is tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable nisource would be required to record a charge in its financial statements for the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements nisource is subject to a financial covenant under its fiveyear revolving credit facility which requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75 as of december 31 2015 the ratio was 64changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect nisources financial resultsnisource is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where it does business legislation or regulation which could affect nisources tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities nisource cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which could have a negative impact on the financial results additionally nisource uses its best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations however a challenge by a taxing authority nisources ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimateschanges in accounting principles may adversely affect nisources financial resultsfuture changes in accounting rules and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the

activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks such as gas leaks downed power lines incidents including thirdparty damages large scale outages and mechanical problems which could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and the general public significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of its operations adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm which in turn could lead to substantial losses to nisource the location of pipeline facilities or generation transmission substation and distribution facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from such events the occurrence of such events could adversely affect nisources financial position and results of operations in accordance with customary industry practice nisource maintains insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses aging infrastructure may lead to disruptions in operations and increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs all of which could negatively impact nisources financial resultsnisource has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement a higher level of maintenance costs and unscheduled outages despite efforts by nisource to properly maintain these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in incidents and in nisources inability to meet firm service obligations adversely impacting revenues and could also result in increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs which if not fully recovered from customers could negatively impact nisources financial results11table of contentsitem 1a risk
