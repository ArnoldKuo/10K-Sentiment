these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisources projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding

subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedingsmost of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisources financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approvalas a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisources growth strategy and financial positionnisources costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the

local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste solid waste and coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisources facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisource fails to comply with environmental laws and regulations or is found to have caused damage to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisources control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisourceexisting environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to increase environmental regulation of the

could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisources facilitieseven in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known or anticipated the original cost estimates for cleanup and environmental capital projects can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of impact the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could

energy industry on october 18 2015 the epa finalized its cpp which regulates greenhouse gas emissions from coal and natural gas electric generating units the cpp is subject to various legal challenges but if the cpp survives these challenges the compliance costs associated with cpp requirements could impact cash flow in addition the cpp could increase nisources cost of producing energy which may impact customer demand andor nisources profitability the cpp requires states or in some cases the epa to develop individualized plans to meet the cpp emission reduction requirements depending on the array of programs chosen by the state of indiana or epa nisources cpp compliance costs could be substantial it is also possible that additional future ghg legislation andor regulation could materially impact nisource the cost impact of any new andor amended ghg legislation or regulations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this timea significant portion

price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power to manage this market risk nisources subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps and options nisource is not involved in speculative energy trading activitycommodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at nisources rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments if states should explore additional regulatory reform these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk some of nisources rateregulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to its customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products these subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness nisource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts the amount of these deposits which are reflected in nisources restricted cash balance may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity marketsthere are no material commodity price risk assets or liabilities as of december 31

accounts receivable programs which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates nisource manages interest rate risk by entering into forward starting interestrate swaps that hedge the interest rate risk related to forecasted issuances of longtermdebt based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase
