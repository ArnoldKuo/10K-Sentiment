nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisources projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact nisources results of operations and financial positionthe majority of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedingsmost of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisources financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approvalas a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisources growth strategy and cash flows nisources costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the recognition of environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitabilitynisources subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of

therefore reduce net income moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisources facilitiesbecause nisources operations deal with natural gas and coal fossil fuels emissions of ghgs are an expected aspect of the business while nisource attempts to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be entirely eliminated the current administration has made it clear that it is focused on reducing ghg emissions through legislation andor regulation imposing statutory or regulatory restrictions andor costs on ghg emissions could increase nisources cost of producing energy which could impact customer demand or nisources profitability compliance costs associated with these

this timeeven in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known the original estimates for cleanup and environmental capital projects can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of contamination the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery from customers changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect nisources financial position operating results and cash flowsa

distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs hedging activities have been deployed in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices and nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner additionally increased gas and electricity costs could result in reduced demand from customers as a result of increased conservation activitiesnisource

account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to

2013 the increase from 2013 to 2014 is expected due to an increase in system growth and equity investments spend as a result of the current profile of identified growth projects in 2014 partially offset by a decrease in the modernization and maintenance spend attributed to advanced spend for the modernization program in 2013 capital expenditures for 2012 were higher than 2011 by approximately 1881 million due to system growth in the marcellus shale areanature of sales  columbia transmission and columbia gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility available capacity and price columbia gulf and columbia transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contractsfirm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used the high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the columbia pipeline group operations segment due to changes in nearterm supply and demand conditions the following percentages exclude the impact of intrasegment revenues trackerrelated revenues and the 50 million refund recorded in the third quarter of 2012 resulting from the columbia transmission customer settlement for the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 931 of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 50 of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to 914 and 57 respectively for the twelve months ended december 31 2012interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service these customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported the ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities columbia pipeline group operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets for the year ended december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 19 and 29 respectively of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contractsenvironmental matterscurrently various environmental matters impact the columbia pipeline group operations segment as of december 31 2013 reserves have been recorded to cover

compared to 16357 mmdth in 2011 the decrease of 406 mmdth was primarily attributable to warmer winter weather in 2012 which drove a vast majority of the decrease on the columbia transmission system fewer deliveries were made on the columbia gulf system to columbia transmission at leach kentucky because of the impact from increased production of appalachian shale gas and the warmer winter weather
