company whose subsidiaries provide natural gas electricity and other products and services to approximately 38 million customers located within a corridor that runs from the gulf coast through the midwest to new england nisource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating results of its thirteen direct subsidiariesthe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nisource and its majorityowned subsidiaries after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions investments for which at least a 20 interest is owned certain joint ventures and limited partnership interests of more than 3 are accounted for under the equity method except where noted above and in the event where nisource has significant influence investments with less than a 20 interest are accounted for under the cost method nisource also consolidates variable interest entities for which nisource is the primary beneficiaryb use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimatesc cash cash equivalents and restricted cash nisource considers all investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents nisource reports amounts deposited in brokerage accounts for margin requirements as restricted cash in addition nisource has amounts deposited in trust to satisfy requirements for the provision of various property liability workers compensation and longterm disability insurance which is classified as restricted cash and disclosed as an investing cash flow on the statements of consolidated cash flowsrestricted cash was 80 million and 468 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the decrease in restricted cash was primarily a result of the sale of nisources unregulated natural gas marketing businessd accounts receivable and unbilled revenue accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts as nisource believes that total accounts receivable is a more meaningful presentation given the factors which impact both billed and unbilled accounts receivable unbilled revenue is based on estimated amounts of electric energy or natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its customers unbilled amounts of accounts receivable relate to a portion of a customers consumption of gas or electricity from the date of the last cycle billing date through the last day of the month balance sheet date factors taken into consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage customer rates and weather accounts receivable fluctuates from year to year depending in large part on weather impacts and price volatility nisources accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets includes unbilled revenue less reserves in the amounts of 3215 million and 2857 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the reserve for uncollectible receivables is the companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable the company determined the reserve based on historical experience and in consideration of current market conditions account balances are charged against the allowance when it is anticipated the receivable will not be recovered e investments in debt and equity securities nisources investments in debt and equity securities are carried at fair value and are designated as availableforsale these investments are included within other investments on the consolidated balance sheets unrealized gains and losses net of deferred income taxes are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive

consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customersin the event that regulation significantly

which generally is an operating segment or a component of an operating segment as defined by the fasb nisources three reporting units are columbia distribution operations columbia transmission operations and nipsco gas distribution operationsnisource has three reporting units that are allocated goodwill nisources goodwill assets at december 31 2013 were 37 billion pertaining primarily to

measurement of its reporting units during the may 1 2012 goodwill test the test indicated that the fair value of each of the reporting units that carry or are allocated goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values indicating that no impairment existed under the step 1 annual impairment testin estimating the fair value of the columbia transmission operations and columbia distribution operations reporting units for the may 1 2012 test nisource used a weighted average of the income and market approaches the income approach utilized a discounted cash flow model this model was based on managements shortterm and longterm forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit the two main assumptions used in the models were the growth rates which were based on the cash flows from operations for each of the reporting units and the weighted average cost of capital or discount rate the starting point for each reporting units cash flow from operations was the detailed five year plan which takes into consideration a variety of factors such as the current economic environment industry trends and specific operating goals set by management the discount rates were based on trends in overall market as well as industry specific variables and include components such as the riskfree rate cost of debt and company volatility at may 1 2012 under the market approach nisource utilized three marketbased models to estimate the fair value of the reporting units i the comparable company multiples method which estimated fair value of each reporting unit by analyzing ebitda multiples of a peer group of publicly traded companies and applying that multiple to the reporting units ebitda ii the comparable transactions method which valued the reporting unit based on observed ebitda multiples from completed transactions of peer companies and applying that multiple to the reporting units ebitda and iii the market capitalization method which used the nisource share price and allocated nisources total market capitalization among both the goodwill and nongoodwill reporting units based on the relative ebitda revenues and operating income of each reporting unit each of the three market approaches were calculated with the assistance of a third party valuation firm using multiples and assumptions inherent in todays market the degree of judgment involved and reliability of inputs into each model were considered in weighting the various approaches the resulting estimate of fair value of the reporting units using the weighted average of the income and market approaches exceeded their carrying values indicating that no impairment exists under step 1 of the annual impairment testcertain key assumptions used in determining the fair values of the reporting units included planned operating results discount rates and the longterm outlook for growth in 2012 nisource used discount rates of 560 for both columbia transmission operations and columbia distribution operations resulting in excess fair values of approximately 16430 million and 16820 million respectively the results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment testgoodwill at nipsco gas distribution operations related to the acquisition of northern indiana fuel and light and kokomo gas of 178 million was also tested for impairment as of may 1 2012 the income approach was used to determine the fair value of the nipsco gas distribution reporting unit key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 560 and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations these cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives the step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the nipsco gas distribution reporting unit to be above the carrying value by 3560 millionin september 2011 fasb issued accounting standards update 201108 which allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative step 0 assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test if a step 0 assessment is performed an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that based on the qualitative step 0 assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount the update was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011nisource applied this guidance for its 2013 annual test and applied the qualitative step 0 analysis to its reporting units for the annual impairment test performed as of may 1 2013for the current year qualitative step 0 test performed as of may 1 2013 nisource assessed various assumptions events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units in its baseline may 1 2012 test the results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that its reporting unit fair values are less than the reporting unit carrying values and no impairments are necessary 72table of contentsitem 8 financial statements and supplementary data continuednisource incnotes to consolidated financial statementsnisource considered whether there were any events or changes in circumstances subsequent to the annual test that would reduce the fair value of any of the reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate another goodwill impairment test no such indicators were noted that would require a subsequent

associated with natural gas purchases or sales by economically hedging the various gas cost components by using a combination of futures options forward physical contracts or other derivative contracts nipsco also uses derivative contracts to minimize risk associated with power price volatility these commodity price risk programs and their respective accounting treatment are described belownipsco columbia of pennsylvania columbia of kentucky and columbia of virginia use nymex futures and nymex options to minimize risk associated with gas price volatility these derivative programs must be marked to fair value but because these derivatives are used within the framework of the companies gcr or fac mechanism regulatory assets or liabilities are recorded to offset the change in the fair value of these derivativesnipsco and columbia of virginia offer a fixed price program as an alternative to the standard gcr mechanism these services provide certain customers with the opportunity to either lock in their gas cost or place a cap on the gas costs that would be charged in future months in order to hedge the anticipated physical purchases associated with these obligations forward physical contracts nymex futures and nymex options are used to secure forward gas prices the accounting treatment elected for these contracts is varied in that certain of these contracts have been accounted for as cash flow hedges while some contracts are not the accounting treatment is based on the election of the company the normal purchase and normal sales exception is elected for forward physical contracts associated with these programs where delivery of the commodity is probable to occurnipsco also offers a dependabill program to its customers as an alternative to the standard tariff rate that is charged to residential customers the program allows nipsco customers to fix their total monthly bill in future months at a flat rate regardless of gas usage or commodity cost in order to hedge the anticipated physical purchases associated with these obligations forward physical contracts nymex futures and nymex options have been used to secure forward gas prices the normal purchase and normal sales exception is elected for forward physical contracts associated with these programs where delivery of the commodity is probable to occurnipsco enters into gas purchase contracts at first of the month prices that give counterparties the daily option to either sell an additional package of gas at first of the month prices or recall the original volume to be delivered nipsco charges a fee for this option the changes in the fair value of these options are primarily due to the changing expectations of the future intramonth volatility of gas prices these written options are

which 1 has an insufficient amount of atrisk equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial subordinated support provided by any other parties 2 whose atrisk equity owners as a group do not have power through voting rights or similar rights to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance or 3 whose atrisk owners do not absorb the entitys losses or receive the entitys residual return a vie is required to be consolidated by a company if that company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie88table

4193table of contentsitem 8 financial statements and supplementary data continuednisource incnotes to consolidated financial statementsbased upon its intent to comply with internal revenue procedures tangible property regulations and the standdown position audit adjustment nisource determined that the unrecognized tax benefit associated with the requested change in tax accounting method filed for 2008 related to electric generation and gas transmission and distribution required a remeasurement under the provisions of asc 740 therefore in the fourth quarter of 2012 nisource recognized an income tax receivable of 857 million related to the 2008 and 2009 tax years and increases in net operating loss carryforwards of 68 million for the tax years 20102012 previously unrecognized except for interest recorded on the tax receivables the recognition of the receivables and net operating loss carryforwards did not materially affect tax expense or net income the irs issued revenue procedure

property for purposes of analyzing repair versus capitalization issues nisource will likely adopt this revenue procedure for income tax filings in 2014 nisource has evaluated and recorded the effect of the change in method enabled by this revenue procedure as of december 31 2013 in 2010 nisource received permission to change its method of accounting for capitalizing overhead costs the company recorded an unrecognized tax benefit related to this uncertain tax position of 176 million in 2010 in 2011 this estimate was revised to 199 million in 2012 the irs completed fieldwork for the audit for the years 20082010 pending joint committee review the company revised the unrecognized tax benefit related to this issue to incorporate 2012 activity at december 31 2012 the unrecognized tax benefits were 211 million this issue was resolved in 2013offsetting the liability for unrecognized tax benefits are 230 million of related outstanding tax receivables and net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a net balance of 07 million including interest related to the tax method change issues except as discussed above there have been no other material changes in 2013 to nisources uncertain tax positions recorded as of december 31 2012the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate is 40 million 22 million and 24 million respectively as of december 31 2013 nisource did not anticipate any significant changes to its liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits over the twelve months ended december 31 2014 as of december 31 2012 it was reasonably possible that a 205 million decrease in unrecorded tax benefits could occur in 2013 due primarily to joint committee taxation review of the 20082010 federal audit the results of the review are described above nisource recognizes accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits accrued interest on other income tax liabilities and tax penalties in income tax expense with respect to its unrecognized tax benefits nisource recorded 08 million 02 million and 01 million in interest expense in the statements of consolidated income for

postretirement benefitsnisource provides defined contribution plans and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans that cover the majority of its employees benefits under the defined benefit retirement plans reflect the employees compensation years of service and age at retirement additionally nisource provides health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees the majority of employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age while working for nisource the expected cost of such benefits is accrued during the employees years of service current rates of rateregulated companies include postretirement benefit costs including amortization of the regulatory assets that arose prior to inclusion of these costs in rates for most plans cash contributions are remitted to grantor trustsnisource pension and other postretirement benefit plans asset management nisource employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the longterm return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and asset class volatility the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments furthermore equity investments are diversified across us and nonus stocks as well as growth value small and large capitalizations other assets such as private equity funds are used judiciously to enhance longterm returns while improving portfolio diversification derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner however derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying assets investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews annual liability measurements and periodic assetliability studiesnisource utilizes a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing in determining the longterm rate of return for plan assets historical markets are studied and longterm historical relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed to ensure that they are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate greater return over the long run current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness the most important component of an investment strategy is the portfolio asset mix or the allocation between the various classes of securities available to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans for investment purposes the asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established for the nisource plan assets represents a longterm view and are listed in the following table in 2012 a dynamic asset allocation policy for the pension fund was approved this policy calls for a gradual reduction in the allocation to returnseeking assets equities real estate private equity and hedge funds and a corresponding increase in the allocation to liabilityhedging assets fixed income as the funded status of the plans increase above 90 as measured by the projected benefit obligations of the qualified pension plans divided by the market value of qualified pension plan assets the asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established by the

in the first quarter of 2012 the epa proposed an outputbased carbon standard for new power plants on september 20 2013 the epa announced withdrawal of the proposed standard and released a new proposal the newly proposed standard would for the first time set national limits on the amount of carbon emissions allowed from new power plants the revised numerical limit requires that compliance for new coalfired plants may need to include capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide in addition the epa stated that it intends to regulate existing sources with a proposed rule expected in 2014if the epa develops a ghg new source performance standard for existing units or if a federal or state comprehensive climate change bill were to be enacted into law the impact on nisources financial performance would depend on a number of factors including the overall level of required ghg reductions the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance and the amount of recovery allowed from customers comprehensive federal or state ghg regulation could result in additional expense or compliance costs that may not be fully recoverable from customers and could materially impact nisources financial
