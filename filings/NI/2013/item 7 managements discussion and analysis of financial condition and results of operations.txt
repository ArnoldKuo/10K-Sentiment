the physical purchase or sale of power the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 278 million in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as

liquidity needswhile the national economy is experiencing some recovery from the recent downturn nisource cannot predict how robust the recovery will be or whether or not it will be sustainedcontinued sluggishness in the economy impacting nisources operating jurisdictions could adversely impact nisources ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs an increase in the interest rates nisource pays would adversely affect future net income and cash flows in addition nisource depends on debt to finance its

benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisources projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact nisources results of operations and financial positionthe majority of nisources net revenues is subject to economic regulation and is exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedingsmost of nisources net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the energy rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisources financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approvalas a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain of the markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisources growth strategy and cash flows nisources costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the recognition of environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitabilitynisources subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste solid waste and coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisources facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisources subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisources control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and its subsidiariesexisting environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to nisources subsidiaries revised or additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisources facilities or increased compliance costs which may not

viability of one or more of nisources facilitiesbecause nisources operations deal with natural gas and coal fossil fuels emissions of ghgs are an expected aspect of the business while nisource attempts to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be entirely eliminated the current administration has made it clear that it is focused on reducing ghg emissions through legislation andor regulation imposing statutory or regulatory restrictions andor costs on ghg emissions could increase nisources cost of producing energy which could impact customer demand or nisources profitability compliance costs associated with these requirements could also affect nisources cash flow the cost impact of any new or amended ghg legislation or regulations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this timeeven in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known the original estimates for cleanup and environmental capital projects can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of contamination the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery from customers changes in costs could affect nisources financial position and cash flowsa significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly the operating results fluctuate depending on the weather and to a certain extent usage of gas or electricityenergy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisources financial results lastly residential and commercial customers usage has shown to be sensitive to economic conditions and the impact of macroeconomic drivers such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence which could also affect nisources financial resultsnisources business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industriesbusiness operations throughout nisources service territories have been and

its gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs hedging activities have been deployed in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices and nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner additionally increased gas and electricity costs could result in reduced demand from customers as a result of increased conservation activitiesnisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreementsnisources extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterpartys financial condition credit history and other factors credit risk exposure is monitored by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit

recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations a decrease in operating expenses of 34 million for the 2012 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs in the 2011 period a decrease in operating expenses of 404 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs net revenuesnisource analyzes the operating results using net revenues net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization nisource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenuestotal consolidated net revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 were 35197 million a 908 million increase compared with 2011 net revenues increased primarily due to increased electric operations net revenues of 1300 million partially offset by lower gas distribution operations net revenue of 536 million and decreased gas transmission and storage operations net revenues of 52 millionelectric operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased industrial commercial and residential usage and margins of 665 million mainly due to the implementation of the electric rate case additionally there were lower revenue credits of 576 million as the electric rate case discontinued these credits net revenues also increased as a result of an increase in a rto recovery mechanism of 106 million and the recognition of emission allowances that were deferred in previous periods of 62 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in

the change in effective income tax rate was relatively flat in 2012 compared to 2011 the 29 increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in

judgments nisource utilized thirdparty valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis nisource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable however actual results may differ materially from those projections nisource used discount rates of 560 for both columbia transmission operations and columbia distribution operations the step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of both columbia transmission operations and columbia distribution operations reporting units to be above carrying value by

approach were a discount rate of 560 and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations these cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives the step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the northern indiana gas distribution reporting unit to be above the carrying value by 3560 millionalthough there was no goodwill asset impairment as of

operations continuedsales and percentage of physical capacity sold  columbia transmission and columbia gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility available capacity and price columbia gulf and columbia transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contractsfirm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used the high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the gas transmission and storage operations segment due to changes in nearterm supply and demand conditions the following percentages exclude the impact of the 50 million refund recorded in the third quarter of 2012 resulting from the columbia transmission customer settlement for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 914 of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 57 of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 917 and 61 respectively for the year ended december 31 2011interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service these customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported the ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities gas transmission and storage operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize
