accounting policiesa company structure and principles of consolidation nisource a delaware corporation is a holding company whose subsidiaries provide natural gas electricity and other products and services to approximately 38 million customers located within a corridor that runs from the gulf coast through the midwest to new england nisource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating results of its thirteen direct subsidiariesthe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nisource and its majorityowned subsidiaries after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions investments for which at least a 20 interest is owned certain joint ventures and limited partnership interests of more than 3 are accounted for under the equity method except where noted above and in the event where nisource has significant influence investments with less than a 20 interest are accounted for under the cost method nisource also consolidates variable interest entities for which nisource is the primary beneficiaryb use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimatesc cash cash equivalents and restricted cash nisource considers all investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents nisource reports amounts deposited in brokerage accounts for margin requirements as restricted cash in addition nisource has amounts deposited in trust to satisfy requirements for the provision of various property liability workers compensation and longterm disability insurance which is classified as restricted cash and disclosed as an investing cash flow on the statements of consolidated cash flowsrestricted cash was 468 million and 1606 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease in restricted cash was primarily a result of the winding down of nisources unregulated natural gas marketing businessd accounts receivable and unbilled revenue accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts as nisource believes that total accounts receivable is a more meaningful presentation given the factors which impact both billed and unbilled accounts receivable unbilled revenue is based on estimated amounts of electric energy or natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its customers unbilled amounts of accounts receivable relate to a portion of a customers consumption of gas or electricity from the date of the last cycle billing date through the last day of the month balance sheet date factors taken into consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage customer rates and weather accounts receivable fluctuates from year to year depending in large part on weather impacts and price volatility nisources accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets includes unbilled revenue less reserves in the amounts of 2857 million and 2815 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the reserve for uncollectible receivables is the companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable the company determined the reserve based on historical experience and in consideration of current market conditions account balances are charged against the allowance when it is anticipated the receivable will not be recovered e investments in debt and equity securities nisources investments in debt and equity securities are carried at fair value and are designated as availableforsale these investments are included within other investments on the consolidated balance sheets unrealized gains and losses net of deferred income taxes are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income loss these investments are monitored for other than temporary declines in market value realized gains and losses and permanent impairments are reflected in the statements of consolidated income no material impairment charges were recorded for the years

the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and it is probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customersin the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the

goodwill for impairment annually unless indicators events or circumstances would require an immediate review goodwill is tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit which generally is an operating segment or a component of an operating segment as defined by gaap in accordance with gaap certain components of an operating segment with similar economic characteristics are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit goodwill is generally allocated to the reporting units based upon the amounts allocated at the time of their respective acquisition the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process which requires nisource to make estimates regarding the fair value of the reporting unit the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired thus the second step of the impairment test is not required however if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any which compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excessduring the second quarter of 2012 nisource changed its method of applying an accounting principle whereby the annual impairment test of goodwill will be performed as of may 1st each year instead of june 30th the previous testing date this change is preferable under the circumstances as it more closely aligns the impairment testing date with the longrange planning and 73table of contentsitem 8 financial statements and supplementary data continuednisource incnotes to consolidated financial statementsforecasting process the change also provides nisource with additional time to complete the required testing and evaluate the results prior to the quarterend closing and reporting activities when resources are more constrained the change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date is not intended to nor does it delay accelerate or avoid an impairment charge as it was impracticable to objectively determine projected cash flows and related valuation estimates as of each may 1 for periods prior to may 1 2012 nisource has prospectively applied the change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date from may 1 2012nisource has three reporting units that are allocated goodwill nisources goodwill assets at december 31 2012 were 37 billion pertaining primarily to the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 of this amount approximately 20 billion is allocated to columbia transmission operations and 17 billion is allocated to columbia distribution operations in addition northern indiana gas distribution operations goodwill assets at december 31 2012 related to the purchase of northern indiana fuel and light in march 1993 and kokomo gas in february 1992 were 188 millionin estimating the fair value of the columbia transmission operations and columbia distribution operations reporting units for the may 1 2012 test nisource used a weighted average of the income and market approaches the income approach utilized a discounted cash flow model this model is based on managements shortterm and longterm forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit the two main assumptions used in the models are the growth rates which are based on the cash flows from operations for each of the reporting units and the weighted average cost of capital or discount rate the starting point for each reporting units cash flow from operations is the detailed five year plan which takes into consideration a variety of factors such as the current economic environment industry trends and specific operating goals set by management the discount rates are based on trends in overall market as well as industry specific variables and include components such as the riskfree rate cost of debt and company volatility at may 1 2012 under the market approach nisource utilized three marketbased models to estimate the fair value of the reporting units i the comparable company multiples method which estimated fair value of each reporting unit by analyzing ebitda multiples of a peer group of publicly traded companies and applying that multiple to the reporting units ebitda ii the comparable transactions method which valued the reporting unit based on observed ebitda multiples from completed transactions of peer companies and applying that multiple to the reporting units ebitda and iii the market capitalization method which used the nisource share price and allocated nisources total market capitalization among both the goodwill and nongoodwill reporting units based on the relative ebitda revenues and operating income of each reporting unit each of the three market approaches were calculated with the assistance of a third party valuation firm using multiples and assumptions inherent in todays market the degree of judgment involved and reliability of inputs into each model were considered in weighting the various approaches the resulting estimate of fair value of the reporting units using the weighted average of the income and market approaches exceeded their carrying values indicating that no impairment exists under step 1 of the annual impairment testcertain key assumptions used in determining the fair values of the reporting units included planned operating results discount rates and the longterm outlook for growth nisource used discount rates of 560 for both columbia transmission operations and columbia distribution operations resulting in excess fair values of approximately 16430 million and 16820 million respectively the results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment testgoodwill at northern indiana gas distribution operations related to the acquisition of northern indiana fuel and light and kokomo gas of 188 million was also tested for impairment as of may 1 2012 the income approach was used to determine the fair value of the northern indiana gas distribution reporting unit key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 560 and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations these cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives the step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the northern indiana gas distribution reporting unit to be above the carrying value by 3560 millionnisource considered whether there were any events or changes in circumstances subsequent to the annual test that would reduce the fair value of any of the reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate another goodwill impairment test no such indicators were noted that would require goodwill impairment testing subsequent to may 1 2012nisources intangible assets apart from goodwill consist of franchise rights which were identified as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition in february 1999 of columbia of massachusetts these amounts were 2866 million and 2976 million net of accumulated amortization of 1555 million and 1446 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively and are being amortized over forty years from the

probable to occur the accumulated gains or losses on the derivative are recognized currently in earnings for fair value hedges the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period together with the change in the fair value of the hedged item as a result of the ratemaking process the rateregulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows these gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back to

was granted permission to change its tax method of accounting for capitalizing certain costs and has taken certain positions related to this change in its 2008 income tax return nisources determination of what constitutes a capital cost versus ordinary expense was subject to revision on audit by the irs as such the status of this tax return position was uncertain during 2009 nisource added 1144 million to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions related to this issue on august 19 2011 the irs issued revenue procedure 201143 which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized this revenue procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the irs to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after december 30 2010 as a result of the issuance of the revenue procedure nisource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of 129 million in the third quarter of 2011 excluding minor amounts of interest the revision in estimate did not impact total income tax expense based upon its intent to comply with internal revenue procedures tangible property regulations and the standdown position audit adjustment nisource has determined that the unrecognized tax benefit associated with the requested change in tax accounting method filed for 2008 related to electric generation and gas transmission and distribution required a remeasurement under the provisions of asc 740 therefore in the fourth quarter of 2012 nisource recognized an income tax receivable of 857 million related to the 2008 and 2009 tax years and increases in net operating loss carryforwards

offsetting the liability for unrecognized tax benefits are 262 million of related outstanding tax receivables and net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a net balance of 32 million including

return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the longterm return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and asset class volatility the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments furthermore equity investments are diversified across us and nonus stocks as well as growth value small and large capitalizations other assets such as private equity and hedge funds are used judiciously to enhance longterm returns while improving portfolio diversification derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner however derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying assets investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews annual liability measurements and periodic assetliability studiesnisource utilizes a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing in determining the longterm rate of return for plan assets historical markets are studied and longterm historical relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed to ensure that they are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate greater return over the long run current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness the most important component of an investment strategy is the portfolio asset mix or the allocation between the various classes of securities available to the pension plan for investment purposes the asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established for the postretirement welfare plan assets represents a longterm view and are listed in the following table in 2012 a dynamic asset allocation policy for the pension fund was approved this policy calls for a gradual

nisource accrues for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the original estimates for

information is collected and estimates become more refinedairthe actions listed below could require further reductions in emissions from various emission sources nisource will continue to closely monitor developments in these mattersclimate change future legislative and regulatory programs could significantly restrict emissions of ghgs or could impose a cost or tax on ghg emissions recently proposals have been developed to implement federal state and regional ghg programs and to create renewable energy standards in the first quarter of 2012 the epa proposed an outputbased carbon standard for new power plants the standard would for the first time set national limits on the amount of carbon emissions allowed from new power plants this numerical limit places compliance out of reach for coalfired plants designed without capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide limiting nisources options for future generation growth in addition based on authority provided by the clean air act once the epa has promulgated a new source performance standard for a new or modified source in a specific source category regulation of existing sources in specific circumstances is requiredif the epa develops a ghg new source performance standard for existing units or if a federal or state comprehensive climate change bill were to be enacted into law the impact on nisources financial performance would depend on a number of factors including the overall level of required ghg reductions the renewable energy targets the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance the amount of recovery allowed from customers and the extent to which nisource would be entitled to receive co2 allowances at no cost comprehensive federal or state ghg regulation could result in additional expense or compliance costs that may not be fully recoverable from customers and could materially impact nisources financial resultsnational ambient air quality standards the caa requires the epa to set national air quality standards for particulate matter and five other pollutants the naaqs considered harmful to public health and the environment periodically the epa imposes new or modifies existing naaqs

predecessors may have liability the program has identified 67 such sites where liability is probable remedial actions at many of these sites are being overseen by state or federal environmental agencies through consent agreements or voluntary remediation agreementsduring the fourth quarter of 2011 nisource completed a probabilistic model to estimate its future remediation costs related to its mgp sites the model was prepared with the assistance of a third party and incorporates nisource and general industry experience with remediating mgp sites nisource accordingly increased its liability for estimated remediation costs by 711 million since the fourth quarter of 2011 nisource has monitored the liability on a quarterly basis and in the second quarter of 2012 completed an
