form 10k          table of contents explanatory note  this report combines the annual reports on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2012 of host hotels amp resorts inc and host hotels amp resorts lp unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires references to host inc mean host hotels amp resorts inc a maryland corporation and references to host lp mean host hotels amp resorts lp a delaware limited partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries we use the terms we or our or the company to refer to host inc and host lp together unless the context indicates otherwise we use the term host inc to specifically refer to host hotels amp resorts inc and the term host lp to specifically refer to host hotels amp resorts lp and its consolidated subsidiaries in cases where it is important to distinguish between host inc and host lp host inc owns properties and conducts operations through host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 986 of the partnership interests op units as of december 31 2012 the remaining approximate 14 partnership interests are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners as the sole general partner of host lp host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lps daytoday management and control  we believe combining the annual reports on form 10k of host inc and host lp into this single report results in the following benefits            enhances investors understanding of host inc and host lp by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business            eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation since a substantial portion of our disclosure applies to both host inc and host lp and            creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports  management operates host inc and host lp as one enterprise the management of host inc consists of the same members who direct the management of host lp the executive officers of host inc are appointed by host incs board of directors but are employed by host lp host lp employs everyone who works for host inc or host lp as general partner with control of host lp host inc consolidates host lp for financial reporting purposes and host inc does not have significant assets other than its investment in host lp therefore the assets and liabilities of host inc and host lp are the same on their respective financial statements  there are a few differences between host inc and host lp which are reflected in the disclosure in this report we believe it is important to understand the differences between host inc and host lp in the context of how host inc and host lp operate as an interrelated consolidated company host inc is a real estate investment trust or reit and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of host lp as a result host inc does not conduct business itself other than acting as the sole general partner of host lp and issuing public equity from time to time the proceeds from which are contributed to host lp in exchange for op units host inc itself does not issue any indebtedness and does not guarantee the debt or obligations of host lp host lp holds substantially all of our assets and holds the ownership interests in our joint ventures host lp conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a limited partnership with no publicly traded equity except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by host inc host lp generates the capital required by our business through host lps operations by host lps direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of op units  the substantive difference between the filings of host inc and host lp is that host inc is a reit with public stock while host lp is a partnership with no publicly traded equity in the financial statements this difference primarily is reflected in the equity or partners capital for host lp section of the consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of equity or partners capital and in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss with respect to the manner in which income is allocated to noncontrolling interests income allocable to the holders of approximately 14 of the op units is reflected as income allocable to noncontrolling interests at host inc and within net income at host lp also earnings per share generally will be slightly less than the earnings per op unit as each host inc common share is the equivalent of 97895 op units instead of 1 op unit apart from these differences the financial statements of host inc and host lp are nearly identical    i    table of contents to help investors understand the differences between host inc and host lp this report presents the following

host incs 2012 annual report to stockholders contain some forwardlooking statements that set forth anticipated results based on managements plans and assumptions from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have tried wherever possible to identify each such statement by using words such as anticipate estimate expect project intend plan believe will target forecast and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance in particular these forwardlooking statements include those relating to future actions future acquisitions or dispositions future capital expenditure plans future performance or results of current and anticipated expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates or the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings   we cannot guarantee that any future results discussed in any forwardlooking statements will be realized although we believe that we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions including those discussed in item 1a risk factors should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could differ materially from past results and those results anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements  we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make or related subjects in our reports on form 10q and form 8k that we file with the securities and exchange commission sec also note that in our risk factors we provide a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from past results and those results anticipated estimated or projected we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 it is not possible to predict or identify all such risk factors consequently you should not consider the discussion of risk factors to be a complete discussion of all of the potential risks or uncertainties that could affect our business      item 1 business  host inc was incorporated as a maryland corporation in 1998 and operates as a selfmanaged and selfadministered reit host inc owns properties and conducts operations through host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and in which it holds approximately 986 of the partnership interests op units as of december 31 2012 the remaining approximate 14 partnership interests are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lps daytoday management and control  as of february 25 2013 our consolidated lodging portfolio consists of 118 primarily luxury and upperupscale hotels containing approximately 62600 rooms with the majority located in the united states and 15 properties located outside of the us in canada new zealand chile australia mexico and brazil we also are developing two hotels in rio de janeiro brazil in addition we own noncontrolling interests in two international joint ventures a joint venture in europe which owns 19 luxury and upper upscale hotels with approximately 6100 rooms in france italy spain the netherlands the united kingdom belgium poland and germany and a joint venture in asiapacific which owns one hotel in australia and minority interests in two operating hotels in india and five additional hotels in india currently under development our other real estate joint ventures include the development of a 225room hyatt place in nashville tennessee and the development of a 131unit vacation ownership project in maui hawaii adjacent to our hyatt regency maui resort amp spa    1    table of contents the lodging industry  the lodging industry in the united states consists of private and public entities that operate in an extremely diversified market under a variety of brand names the lodging industry has several key participants            owners  own the hotel and typically enter into an agreement for an independent third party to manage the hotel these properties may be branded and operated under the managers brand or branded under a franchise agreement and operated by the franchisee or by an independent hotel manager the properties also may be operated as an independent hotel by an independent hotel manager            ownermanagers  own the hotel and operate the property with their own management team these properties may be branded under a franchise agreement operated as an independent hotel or operated under the owners brand we are prohibited from operating and managing hotels under applicable reit rules            franchisors  own a brand or brands and strive to grow their revenues by expanding the number of hotels in their franchise system franchisors provide their hotels with brand recognition marketing support and centralized reservation systems for the franchised hotels            franchisormanagers  own a brand or brands and also operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner or franchisee            managers  operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner but do not themselves own a brand the hotels may be operated under a franchise agreement or as an independent hotel  the hotel manager is responsible for the daytoday operation of the hotel including the employment of hotel staff the determination of room rates the development of sales and marketing plans the preparation of operating and capital expenditure budgets and the preparation of financial reports for the owner they typically receive fees based on the revenues and profitability of the hotel  revenue per available room revpar is an operational measure commonly used in the hotel industry to evaluate hotel performance revpar represents the product of the average daily room rate adr charged and the average daily occupancy achieved but excludes other revenue generated by a hotel property such as food and beverage parking and other revenues adr reflects the average rate charged by hotels average rates can be influenced by among other things demand previously negotiated contracts the overall mix of business and new supply in a given market  our industry is influenced by the cyclical relationship between the supply of and demand for hotel rooms lodging demand growth typically is related to the vitality of the overall economy in addition to local market factors that stimulate travel to specific destinations in particular economic indicators such as gdp growth business investment and employment growth are some of the primary drivers of lodging demand between 2003 and 2007 broad growth in the economy led to increases in demand however the global recession of 2008 through 2009 resulted in a considerable decline in both consumer and business spending and a severe decline in demand within the lodging industry while lodging demand has not recovered fully from the steep declines in those years the gradual recovery that began in 2010 has continued through 2012 led by transient demand from business and leisure travelers we expect demand to continue to improve in 2013 though the rate of growth may be affected by uncertainty in the direction of both the domestic and global economy  lodging supply growth generally is driven by overall lodging demand as extended periods of strong demand growth tend to encourage new development however the rate of supply growth also is influenced by a number of additional factors including the availability of capital interest rates construction costs and unique market considerations the relatively long leadtime required to complete the development of hotels makes supply growth easier to forecast than demand growth but increases the volatility of the cyclical behavior of the lodging industry as illustrated in the charts below at different points in the cycle demand may increase when there is no new supply or supply may grow when demand is declining the decline in lodging demand during the recession of 2008 through    2    table of contents  2009 and the lack of available financing for new hotel construction caused a significant reduction in hotel development as a result supply growth was relatively low in 2010 through 2012 and we expect growth through 2013 to continue to be below the historical growth rate of 2 based on data from smith travel research over the past 25 years  we anticipate that demand growth will exceed supply growth in the near term resulting in continued revpar growth which is consistent with analysis prepared by pkf hospitality research occupancy levels in the upperupscale market are currently close to their 15year average therefore while there is still potential for occupancy growth we believe revpar growth will primarily be driven by increases in average room rate however the pace of economic recovery and general market uncertainty will continue to impact negatively the pace of improvement in the industry therefore there can be no assurance that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties or improvement in margins will continue for any number of reasons including those listed above  the charts below detail the historical supply demand and revpar growth for the us lodging industry and for the upper upscale segment for 2008 to 2012 and forecast data for 2013 our portfolio primarily consists of upper upscale hotels and accordingly its performance is best understood in comparison to the upper upscale segment rather than the entire industry  us lodging industry supply demand and revpar growth         3    table of contents us upper upscale supply demand and revpar growth       business strategy  our primary longterm business objective is to provide superior total returns to our equity holders through a combination of appreciation in asset values growth in earnings and dividend distributions to achieve this objective we seek to            drive operating results at our properties through aggressive asset management            acquire properties in urban and resortconference destinations that are operated by leading management companies we will continue to focus on target markets and gateway cities such as new york washington dc boston miami chicago los angeles san francisco san diego and seattle which we believe have strong demand generators that appeal to multiple customer segments and have high barriers to entry that limit new supply while our focus will remain primarily on luxury and upper upscale properties we will remain opportunistic and may acquire or develop hotels in other lodging segments or markets            strategically invest in major redevelopment and return on investment roi projects in order to maximize the inherent value in our portfolio            maintain a strong balance sheet with a low leverage level and balanced debt maturities in order to minimize our cost of capital and to maximize our financial flexibility in order to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging cycle            expand our global portfolio holdings and revenue sources through joint ventures or direct acquisitions that diversify our investments and            recycle capital through the disposition of assets to better align our portfolio within our target gateway markets we also may opportunistically dispose of hotels to take advantage of market conditions or in situations where the hotels are at a competitive risk    4    table of contents acquisitions and new development our acquisition strategy focuses on acquiring hotels at attractive yields that exceed our cost of capital in our target markets these markets consist of gateway cities in the us and in key international cities that are positioned to attract premium corporate leisure and international travelers while at the same time have significant barriers to entry based on historical trends we believe these markets will have favorable longterm supply and demand dynamics and consequently better potential for revenue growth in the us we will focus primarily on acquiring upper upscale and luxury hotels and secondarily developing midscale and upscale hotels with strategic partners in these target markets our efforts in europe will be to acquire upper upscale and luxury hotels in our target markets such as london paris and munich in the asiapacific and latin america regions we will concentrate on both the acquisition of upper upscale and luxury hotels and the development of midscale and upscale hotels in our target markets such as australia and brazil  redevelopment and return on investment projects we pursue opportunities to enhance asset value by completing select capital improvements outside the scope of recurring renewal and replacement capital expenditures these projects are designed to take advantage of changing market conditions and the favorable location of our properties to enhance customer satisfaction and increase profitability we evaluate our capital expenditure projects based on their economic and environmental impact in collaboration with our hotel managers we evaluate new products and systems designed to yield predictable and targeted results while improving overall energy efficiency and reducing water consumption examples include inroom and central energy management systems lighting retrofits low flow plumbing fixtures and intelligent landscape irrigation systems  redevelopment projects these projects are designed to optimally position our hotels within their markets and competitive set redevelopment projects include extensive renovations of guest rooms including bathrooms lobbies food and beverage outlets expanding ballroom and meeting rooms and major mechanical system upgrades  targeted return on investment projects these roi projects often are smaller and focused on specific areas such as converting unprofitable or underutilized space into meeting space or adding guestrooms we also target projects that improve utility efficiency through the implementation and adoption of proven sustainable technologies  value enhancement capital projects these projects identify and execute strategies that seek to maximize the highest and best use of all aspects of our hotels these projects include the development of timeshare or condominium units on excess land or the acquisition of air rights or development entitlements that add value to our portfolio currently or in the event that we sell the hotel  acquisition projects in conjunction with the acquisition of a property we prepare capital and operational improvement plans designed to improve profitability and enhance the guest experience these projects may include required renewal and replacement projects significant redevelopment and even rebranding of the property and represent a key component of our decision to invest in a hotel that are typically completed within two to three years  asset management as host inc is the nations largest lodging reit with a diverse portfolio of properties we are in a unique position to work with our managers to maximize revenues while minimizing operating costs the size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading operators and brands in the industry allow us to benchmark similar hotels and identify best practices and efficiencies that can be implemented at our properties all of which improve the longterm profitability of the hotel  a key component of our asset management strategy is maintaining the high standards of product quality of our properties we work closely with our managers to ensure that renewal and replacement expenditures are spent efficiently in order to maximize the profitability of the hotel typically room refurbishments occur at intervals of approximately seven years but the timing may vary based on the type of property and equipment being replaced these refurbishments generally are divided into the following types soft goods case goods bathroom and    5    table of contents  infrastructure soft goods include items such as carpeting bed spreads curtains and wall vinyl and may require more frequent updates in order to maintain brand quality standards case goods include items such as dressers desks couches restaurant and meeting room chairs and tables and generally are not replaced as frequently bathroom renovations range from refresh of vinyl and paint to full renovation and replacement of tile vanity lighting and plumbing fixtures infrastructure includes the physical plant of the hotel including the roof elevators façade and fire systems which are subject to regular maintenance and then replaced at the end of their useful lives  capital structure and liquidity profile in order to maintain its qualification as a reit host inc is required to distribute 90 of its taxable income other than net capital gain to its stockholders and as a result generally relies on external sources of capital to finance growth we use a variety of debt and equity instruments to fund our external growth including senior notes and mortgage debt exchangeable debentures common and preferred stock offerings issuances of host lp partnership units and joint ventureslimited partnerships to take advantage of the prevailing market conditions while we may issue debt at any time management believes it is prudent over time to target a leverage ratio of approximately 30x debttoebitda consistent with this strategy we have significantly improved our credit statistics over the past several years we believe that lower leverage reduces our overall cost of capital and our earnings volatility and increases our access to capital thereby providing us with the necessary flexibility to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging cycle which we consider a key competitive advantage  we also seek to structure our debt profile to allow us to access different forms of financing primarily senior notes and exchangeable debentures as well as mortgage debt particularly outside of the us when debt is priced reasonably generally this means we look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt minimize nearterm maturities and maintain a balanced maturity schedule  joint ventures we expect to continue to utilize joint ventures to finance external growth we believe joint ventures provide a significant means to access external capital and spread the inherent risk of hotel ownership our primary focus for joint ventures is in international markets which helps to diversify exposure to market risk  dispositions our disposition strategy is aligned with our overall portfolio focus to reallocate our investments to target gateway markets generally our dispositions will be focused on secondary or tertiary markets or as part of our strategy to limit our total investment within individual markets we may dispose of assets in our primary markets through direct sales or through the creation of joint ventures when we have the opportunity to capitalize on value enhancement strategies and apply the proceeds to other business objectives additionally we will dispose of properties where we believe the potential for growth is constrained or on properties with significant capital expenditure requirements where we do not believe we would generate a significant return on the investment proceeds from dispositions are deployed to repay debt or fund acquisitions and roiredevelopment projects  corporate responsibility  hosts corporate responsibility strategy integrates fiscal environmental and social elements at both the corporate and portfolio levels our corporate responsibility program focuses on the following themes and objectives            responsible investment further consider sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities during the development and acquisition processes and throughout the ownership period            environmental stewardship collaborate with and support our hotel managers to reduce overall carbon emissions energy and water consumption and waste stream within our portfolio and            corporate citizenship strengthen the local communities where we do business through financial support partnership volunteerism and coordination with our hotel managers  management and governance our corporate responsibility program is managed by our corporate responsibility team and governed by our board of directors nominating and corporate governance committee  operating structure  host inc operates through an umbrella partnership structure in which substantially all of its assets are held by host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and holds approximately 986 of the op units as of    6    table of contents  december 31 2012 a reit is a corporation that has elected to be treated as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code and that meets certain ownership organizational and operating requirements set forth under the code in general through payments of dividends to stockholders a reit is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level each op unit owned by holders other than host inc is redeemable at the option of the holder for an amount of cash equal to the market value of one share of host inc common stock multiplied by a factor of 1021494 rather than a conversion factor of 1 shareop unit that existed prior to the december 2009 stock dividend host inc has the right to acquire any op unit offered for redemption directly from the holder in exchange for 1021494 shares of host inc common stock instead of host lp redeeming such op unit for cash additionally for every share of common stock issued by host inc host lp will issue 97895 op units to host inc as of december 31 2012 noncontrolling limited partners held 99 million op units which were convertible into 101 million host inc common shares assuming that all op units held by noncontrolling limited partners were converted into common shares there would have been 7347 million common shares of host inc outstanding at december 31 2012  our operating structure is as follows       because host inc has elected to be treated as a reit certain tax laws limit the amount of nonqualifying income that host inc and host lp can earn including income derived directly from the operation of hotels as a result we lease substantially all of our consolidated properties to certain of our subsidiaries designated as taxable reit subsidiaries trs for federal income tax purposes or to third party lessees our trs are subject to income tax and are not limited as to the amount of nonqualifying income they can generate the lessees and our trs enter into agreements with third parties to manage the operations of the hotels our trs also may own assets engaging in other activities that produce nonqualifying income such as the development of timeshare or condominium units subject to certain restrictions the difference between the hotels net operating cash flow and the aggregate rents paid to host lp is retained by our trs as taxable income accordingly the net effect of the trs leases is that while as a reit host inc generally is exempt from federal income tax to the extent that it meets specific distribution requirements among other reit requirements a portion of the net operating cash flow from our properties is subject to federal state and if applicable foreign income tax    7    table of contents our hotel properties  overview we have 118 hotels in our portfolio primarily consisting of luxury and upper upscale properties these hotels generally are located in the central business districts of major cities near airports and resortconference destinations that because of their locations typically benefit from barriers to entry for new supply these properties typically include meeting and banquet facilities a variety of restaurants and lounges swimming pools exercise facilities andor spas gift shops and parking

the lodging industry is highly competitive competition often is specific to individual markets and is based on a number of factors including location brand guest facilities and amenities level of service room rates and the quality of accommodations the lodging industry generally is viewed as consisting of six different segments each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs luxury upper upscale upscale midscale with and without food and beverage service and economy the classification of a property is based on lodging industry standards which take into consideration many factors such as guest facilities and amenities level of service and quality of accommodations most of our hotels operate in urban and resort markets either as luxury properties under such brand names as fairmont four seasons grand hyatt jw marriott ritzcarlton st regis the luxury collection and w or as upper upscale properties under such brand names as embassy suites hilton hyatt le méridien marriott executive apartments marriott marquis marriott suites pullman renaissance sheraton swissôtel and westin we also may selectively invest in upscale and midscale properties such as courtyard by marriott crowne plaza four points by sheraton hyatt place ibis novotel or residence inn by marriott particularly in international markets1 while our hotels primarily compete with other hotels in the luxury and upper upscale segments they also may compete with hotels in other lowertier segments  we believe our properties enjoy competitive advantages associated with the hotel brands under which they operate the international marketing programs and reservation systems of these brands combined with the strong management systems and expertise they provide should enable our properties to perform favorably in terms of both occupancy and room rates in addition repeat guest business is enhanced by guest reward or guest recognition programs offered by most of these brands nevertheless many management contracts for our hotels do not prohibit our managers from converting franchising or developing other hotel properties in our markets as a result our hotels compete with other hotels that our managers may own invest in manage or franchise  we also compete with other reits and other public and private investors for the acquisition of new properties and investment opportunities in both domestic and international markets as we attempt to position our portfolio to take best advantage of changes in markets and travel patterns of our customers  seasonality  our hotel sales traditionally have experienced moderate seasonality which varies based on the individual property and the region historically our reporting cycle for hotel revenues for our domestic marriottmanaged hotels reflects 16 or 17 weeks of results in the fourth quarter compared to 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters of the year for our nonmarriott managed hotels the first quarter includes two months of operations the second and third quarters include three months of operations and the fourth quarter includes four months of operations hotel sales have averaged approximately 20 26 22 and 32 for the first second third and fourth quarters respectively under our historic reporting calendar however marriott announced that beginning january 1 2013 it will convert from a 5253 week fiscal year to a 12month calendar year as a result we will report our hotel results based on a 3month quarterly reporting cycle beginning with the first quarter of 2013 based on this new reporting cycle we estimate that hotel sales will be 24 in the first quarter 27 in the second quarter 24 in the third quarter and 25 in the fourth quarter see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial

regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances these laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances in addition certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of hazardous or toxic materials and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released hazardous or toxic materials environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated and these restrictions may require corrective or other expenditures in connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels we potentially may be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities although currently we are not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us we can offer no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future  operational agreements  all of our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements with some of those hotels also subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operation under the designated brand under these agreements the managers generally have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the daytoday operation of the hotels including establishing room rates securing and processing reservations procuring inventories supplies and services providing periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers technical and operational experts and promoting and publicizing the hotels the managers provide all managerial and other employees for the hotels review the operation and maintenance of the hotels prepare reports budgets and projections and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels these support services include planning and policy services divisional financial services product planning and development employee staffing and training corporate executive management and certain inhouse legal services we have certain approval rights over budgets capital expenditures significant leases and contractual commitments and various other matters  general terms and provisions  agreements governing the management and operation of our hotels typically include the terms described below            term and fees for operational services the initial term of our management and operating agreements generally is 15 to 25 years with one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager the majority of our management agreements condition the managers right to exercise options for specified renewal terms upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria the manager typically receives compensation in the form of a base management fee which is calculated as a percentage generally 23 of annual gross revenues and an incentive management fee which typically is calculated as a percentage generally 1020 of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the hotel in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the base management fee only is 1 of annual gross revenues but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable to starwood under a separate license agreement as described below            license services in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the operation of the hotels is subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to the designated brand including rights to use trademarks service marks and logos matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services although the term of these license agreements with starwood generally is coterminous with the corresponding operating    13    table of contents       agreements the license agreements contemplate the potential for continued brand affiliation even in the event of a termination of the operating agreement as noted above the starwood licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees generally 5 of gross revenues attributable to room sales and 2 of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales which amounts supplement the lower base management fee of 1 of gross revenues received by starwood under the operating agreements            chain or system programs and services managers are required to provide chain or system programs and services generally that are furnished on a centralized basis such services include the development and operation of certain computer systems and reservation services regional or other centralized management and administrative services marketing and sales programs and services training and other personnel services and other centralized or regional services as may be determined to be more efficiently performed on a centralized regional or group basis rather than on an individual hotel basis costs and expenses incurred in providing these chain or system programs and services generally are allocated on a cost reimbursement basis among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates or that otherwise benefit from these services            working capital and fixed asset supplies we are required to maintain working capital for each hotel and to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies for example linen china glassware silver and uniforms we also are responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds available from working capital are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels for certain hotels the working capital accounts which would otherwise be maintained by the managers for each of such hotels are maintained on a pooled basis with managers being authorized to make withdrawals from such pooled account as otherwise contemplated with respect to working capital in accordance with the provisions of the management or operating agreements            furniture fixtures and equipment replacements we are required to provide the managers with all furniture fixtures and equipment ffampe necessary for the operation of the hotels including funding any required ffampe replacements on an annual basis the managers prepare budgets for ffampe to be acquired and certain routine repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the necessary funds which budgets are subject to our review and approval for purposes of funding such expenditures a specified percentage typically 5 of the gross revenues of each hotel is deposited by the manager into an escrow or reserve account in our name to which the manager has access in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels our operating agreements contemplate that this reserve account also may be used to fund the cost of certain major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building as described below for certain of our marriottmanaged hotels we have entered into an agreement with marriott to allow for such expenditures to be funded from one pooled reserve account rather than funds being deposited into separate reserve accounts at each hotel with the minimum required balance maintained on an ongoing basis in that pooled reserve account being significantly below the amount that would otherwise have been maintained in such separate hotel reserve accounts for certain of our starwoodmanaged hotels the periodic reserve fund contributions which otherwise would be deposited into reserve accounts maintained by managers for each hotel are distributed to us and as to this pool of hotels we are responsible for providing funding of expenditures which otherwise would be funded from reserve accounts for each of the subject hotels            building alterations improvements and renewals the managers are required to prepare an annual estimate of the expenditures necessary for major repairs alterations improvements renewals and replacements to the structural mechanical electrical heating ventilating air conditioning plumbing and elevators of each hotel along with alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required in the managers reasonable judgment to keep the hotel in a competitive efficient and economical operating condition that is consistent with brand standards we generally have approval rights as to such budgets and expenditures which we review and approve based on our managers recommendations and on our judgment expenditures for these major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building typically are funded directly by owners although as noted above our agreements with starwood contemplate that certain such expenditures may be funded from the reserve account    14    table of contents         treatment of additional owner funding as additional owner funding becomes necessary either for expenditures generally funded from the ffampe replacement funds or for any major repairs or improvements to the hotel building which may be required to be funded directly by owners most of our agreements provide for an economic benefit to us through an impact on the calculation of incentive management fees payable to our managers one approach frequently utilized at our marriottmanaged hotels is to provide such owner funding through loans which are repaid with interest from operational revenues with the repayment amounts reducing operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees another approach typically that is used at our starwoodmanaged hotels as well as with certain expenditures projects at our marriottmanaged hotels is to treat such owner funding as an increase to our investment in the hotel resulting in an increase to owners priority return with a corresponding reduction to the amount of operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees for our starwoodmanaged hotels that are subject to the pooled arrangement described above the amount of any additional reserve account funding is allocated to each of such hotels on a pro rata basis determined with reference to the net operating income of each hotel and the total net operating income of all such pooled hotels for the most recent operating year            territorial protections certain management and operating agreements impose restrictions for a specified period which limit the manager and its affiliates from owning operating or licensing a hotel of the same brand within a specified area the area restrictions vary with each hotel from city blocks in urban areas to up to a multimile radius from the hotel in other areas            sale of the hotel subject to specific agreements as to certain hotels see below under special termination rights we generally are limited in our ability to sell lease or otherwise transfer the hotels by the requirement that the transferee assume the related management agreements and meet specified other conditions including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the manager            performance termination rights in addition to any right to terminate that may arise as a result of a default by the manager most of our management and operating agreements include reserved rights by us to terminate management or operating agreements on the basis of the managers failure to meet certain performancebased metrics typically including a specified threshold return on owners investment in the hotel along with a failure of the hotel to achieve a specified revpar performance threshold established with reference to other competitive hotels in the market typically such performancebased termination rights arise in the event the operator fails to achieve specified performance thresholds over a consecutive twoyear period and are subject to the managers ability to cure and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts or in some instances waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees we have agreed in the past and may agree in the future to waive certain of these termination rights in exchange for consideration from a manager or its affiliates which consideration may include cash compensation or amendments to management agreements            special termination rights in addition to any performancebased or other termination rights set forth in our management and operating agreements we have negotiated with marriott and starwood specific termination rights as to certain management and operating agreements while the brand affiliation of a property may increase the value of a hotel the ability to dispose of a property unencumbered by a management agreement or even brand affiliation also can increase the value for prospective purchasers these termination rights can take a number of different forms including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation as well as termination without sale or other condition which may require payment of a fee these termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by ebitda require that a certain number of properties continue to maintain the brand affiliation or be restricted to a specific pool of assets    15    table of contents employees  as of december 31 2012 we had 233 employees of which 208 work in the united states we had 25 employees located in our offices in london rio de janeiro amsterdam and singapore none of hosts employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements other than those working in our office in rio de janeiro these employee numbers do not include the 522 hotel employees of our new zealand and australian properties which also are host employees as they are under the direct supervision and control of our thirdparty hotel managers our thirdparty managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels although we do not manage employees at our consolidated hotels we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force particularly those hotels with unionized labor we believe relations with these employees are positive for a discussion of these relationships see part i item 1a risk factors  we are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor  employees at certain of our thirdparty managed hotels are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to review and renewal on a regular basis for a discussion of

a part of any document unless expressly incorporated by reference therein      item 1a risk factors  the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995    16    table of contents financial risks and risks of operation  our revenues and the value of our properties are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry  the lodging industry is subject to changes in the travel patterns of business and leisure travelers both of which are affected by the strength of the economy as well as other factors changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers may create difficulties for the industry over the longterm and adversely affect our results during the recession in 2008 and 2009 overall travel was reduced which had a significant effect on our results of operations while operating results have improved since then uncertainty in the strength and direction of the recovery and continued high unemployment have slowed the pace of the overall economic recovery therefore there can be no assurance that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons including but not limited to slower than anticipated growth in the economy our results of operations and any forecast we make may be affected by and can change based on a variety of circumstances that affect the lodging industry including            changes in the international national regional and local economic climate            changes in business and leisure travel patterns            the effect of terrorist attacks and terror alerts in the united states and internationally as well as other geopolitical disturbances            supply growth in markets where we own hotels which may adversely affect demand at our properties            the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers relative to competing hotels            the performance of the managers of our hotels            outbreaks of disease and the impact on travel of natural disasters and weather            physical damage to our hotels as a result of earthquakes hurricanes or other natural disasters or the income lost as a result of the damage            changes in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors and            unionization of the labor force at our hotels  a reduction in our revenue or earnings as a result of the above risks may reduce our working capital impact our longterm business strategy and impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet certain covenants in our existing debt agreements  in addition the continuing debate in congress regarding the national debt ceiling federal budget deficit concerns and overall weakness in the economy resulted in actual and threatened downgrades of us government securities by the various major credit ratings agencies including standard amp poors and fitch ratings all of these factors have created uncertainty in us and global financial markets which factors could have material adverse impacts on financial markets and economic conditions in the united states and throughout the world this in turn could directly or indirectly adversely affect lodging demand and therefore our business and financial condition because of the unprecedented nature of these events including the negative credit rating actions with respect to us government securities the ultimate impact on global markets and our business financial condition and liquidity are unpredictable and may not be immediately apparent also in 2012 standard amp poors lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on france italy and seven other european countries which has impacted negatively global markets and economic conditions the continued uncertainty over the outcome of the governments and other european union eu member states financial support programs and the possibility that other eu member states may experience similar financial troubles could further disrupt global markets and economic growth in these countries we have properties in several eu member states held through our european joint venture that have experienced difficulties servicing their sovereign debt including italy and spain and the results of operations at those hotels also could be affected adversely by any adverse economic conditions in these countries    17    table of contents disruptions in the financial markets may affect adversely our business and results of operations our ability to obtain financing on reasonable and acceptable terms and our ability to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk  the united states and global equity and credit markets have at times experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions since 2008 all of which caused market prices of the stock of many companies to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective and outstanding debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances impacted liquidity in the financial markets which made terms for financings less attractive and in some cases resulted in the lack of availability of certain types of financing continued uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may impact negatively our ability to access additional shortterm and longterm financing on reasonable terms or at all which would impact negatively our liquidity and financial condition a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may impact negatively our ability to enter into derivative contracts in order to hedge risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates disruptions in the financial markets also may adversely affect our credit rating while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity with which to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital debt service and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future if our operating results weaken significantly and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or if interest rates increase significantly we could face liquidity problems that could affect materially and adversely our results of operations and financial condition  economic conditions may affect adversely the value of our hotels which may result in impairment charges on our properties  we analyze our assets for impairment in several situations including when a property has current or projected losses from operations when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when other material trends contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred such that an assets carrying value may not be recoverable for impaired assets we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the propertys carrying value over its fair value we may incur additional impairment charges in the future which charges will affect negatively our results of operations we can provide no assurance that any impairment loss recognized would not be material to our results of operations for information on impairment charges taken in 2011 and 2012 see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies  we depend on external sources of capital for future growth and we may be unable to access capital when necessary  unlike regular c corporations host inc must finance its growth and fund debt repayments largely with external sources of capital because it is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of its taxable income other than net capital gain in order to qualify as a reit including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which it does not receive cash funds used by host inc to make required distributions are provided through distributions from host lp our ability to access external capital could be hampered by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control including credit market conditions as discussed above unfavorable market perception of our growth potential decreases in our current and estimated future earnings or decreases in the market price of the common stock of host inc our ability to access additional capital also may be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness which under certain circumstances restrict our incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and host lp distributions the occurrence of any of these factors individually or in combination could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our future growth  we have substantial debt and may incur additional debt  as of december 31 2012 we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately 54 billion our substantial indebtedness requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures expansion efforts dividends and distributions and other general corporate needs additionally our substantial indebtedness could            make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness    18    table of contents         limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or to obtain financing for expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate needs on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all or            affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions  if our cash flow and working capital are not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness we will have to raise additional funds through            sales of host lps op units or host incs common stock            the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by host lp or            the sale of our assets  we cannot make any assurances that any of these sources of funds will be available to us or if available will be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient to meet our obligations or fulfill our business plan under certain circumstances we would be required to use the cash from some of the events described above to repay other indebtedness  the terms of our debt place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and these restrictions reduce our operational flexibility and create default risks  the documents governing the terms of our existing senior notes and our credit facility contain covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries these covenants restrict among other things our ability to            conduct acquisitions mergers or consolidations unless the successor entity in such transaction assumes our indebtedness            incur additional debt in excess of certain thresholds and without satisfying certain financial metrics            create liens securing indebtedness unless an effective provision is made to secure our other indebtedness by such liens            sell assets without using the proceeds from such sales for certain permitted uses or to make an offer to repay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness            make distributions without satisfying certain financial metrics and            conduct transactions with affiliates other than on an arms length basis and in certain instances without obtaining opinions as to the fairness of such transactions  certain of these covenants under our senior notes including restrictions on incurring debt and making distributions are no longer in effect while our senior notes maintain their current investment grade rating however we are still subject to similar covenants under the terms of our credit facility in addition certain covenants in our credit facility also require us and our subsidiaries to meet financial performance tests the restrictive covenants in the applicable indentures the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt including our mortgage debt will reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt in addition certain of our mortgage debt requires that to the extent cash flow from the hotels which secure such debt drops below stated levels we escrow cash flow after the payment of debt service until operations improve above the stated levels in some cases the lender may apply the escrowed amount to the outstanding balance of the mortgage debt if such provisions are triggered the amounts required to be escrowed may affect negatively our liquidity by    19    table of contents  limiting our access to cash flow after debt service from these mortgaged properties for a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition  our ability to pay dividends and to make distributions may be limited or prohibited by the terms of our indebtedness or preferred units  we are and may in the future become party to agreements and instruments that restrict or prevent the payment of dividends on classes and series of host inc capital stock and host lps payment of distributions on its classes of units under the terms of host lps credit facility distributions to host lp unitholders including host inc upon which host inc depends in order to obtain the cash necessary to pay dividends are permitted only to the extent that host lp can satisfy certain financial covenant tests concerning leverage fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage and meet other requirements we will also be subject to similar restrictions under the terms of our senior notes if our senior notes are no longer rated investment grade we are permitted under our credit facility and senior notes indenture to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain host incs reit status  under the terms of host lps outstanding preferred op units we are not permitted to make distributions on our common op units unless all cumulative distributions have been paid or funds for payment have been set aside for payment on our preferred op units in the event that we fail to pay the accrued distributions on our preferred op units for any reason including any restriction on making such distributions under the terms of our debt instruments as discussed above distributions will continue to accrue on such preferred op units and we will be prohibited from making any distributions on our common op units until all such accrued but unpaid distributions on our preferred op units have been paid or funds for such payment have been set aside  an increase in interest rates would increase the interest costs on our credit facility and on our floating rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets  interest payments for borrowings on our credit facility the mortgages on nine properties and the fixedto floating interest rate swaps linked to two other properties are based on floating rates as a result an increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes including investments in our portfolio further rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures and increase interest costs on any debt that is refinanced we may from time to time enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps caps floors and other interest rate hedging contracts currently all of the mortgages with floating rates which are secured by nine of our hotel properties are fully or partially hedged through the use of floatingtofixed interest rate swaps or interest rate caps and floors while these agreements may lessen the impact of rising interest rates they also expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to dispose of assets as part of our business strategy  rating agency downgrades may increase our cost of capital  our senior notes are rated by moodys investors service standard amp poors ratings services and fitch ratings these independent rating agencies may elect to downgrade their ratings on our senior notes at any time such downgrades may affect negatively our access to the capital markets and increase our cost of capital  our expenses may not decrease if our revenue decreases  many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels such as debtservice payments property taxes insurance utilities and employee wages and benefits are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in revenue at the hotels our expenses also will be affected by inflationary increases and certain costs such as wages benefits and insurance may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period in the event of a significant decrease in demand our hotel managers may not be able to reduce the size of hotel work forces in order to decrease wages and benefits our managers also may be unable to offset any such increased expenses with higher room rates any of our efforts to reduce operating costs or failure to make scheduled capital expenditures also could adversely affect the future growth of our business and the value of our hotel properties    20    table of contents our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations  as part of our business strategy we seek to acquire primarily luxury and upper upscale hotel properties we may acquire properties through various structures including transactions involving portfolios single assets joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits or similar real estate entities we anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods including proceeds from host inc equity offerings issuance of limited partnership interests of host lp advances under our credit facility the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness and proceeds from the sales of assets continued disruptions in credit markets may limit our ability to finance acquisitions and may limit the ability of purchasers to finance hotels and affect adversely our disposition strategy and our ability to use disposition proceeds to finance acquisitions  we may from time to time be in the process of identifying analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations including as a result of our forfeiture of deposits in connection with our failure to consummate an acquisition or our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions  we may not achieve the value we anticipate from new hotel developments or value enhancement projects at our existing hotels  we currently are and in the future may be involved in the development of hotel properties timeshare units or other alternate uses of portions of our existing properties including the development of retail office or apartments including through joint ventures there are risks inherent in any new development including            we may not obtain the zoning occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations necessary to complete the development a delay in receiving these approvals could affect the returns we expect to receive            any new construction involves the possibility of construction delays and cost overruns that may increase project costs            defects in design or construction may result in delays and additional costs to remedy the defect or require a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the defect            we may not be able to meet the loan covenants in any financing obtained to fund the new development creating default risks            the development of timeshare units could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for residential fractional or interval ownership increases in mortgage rates andor decreases in mortgage availability market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell the timeshares for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate  in addition to the extent that developments are conducted through joint ventures that involve shared control this creates additional risks including the possibility that our partners may not meet their financial obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours see we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts  any of the above factors could affect adversely our and our partners ability to complete the developments on schedule and along the scope that currently is contemplated or to achieve the intended value of these projects for these reasons there can be no assurances as to the value to be realized by the company from these transactions or any future similar transactions    21    table of contents we do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels  we have entered into management agreements with thirdparty managers to operate our hotel properties the cash flow from our hotels may be affected adversely if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name while we monitor the hotel managers performance we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately in addition from time to time we have had and continue to have differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements we generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations however if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to thirdparty dispute resolution failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements could affect adversely our results of operations our hotel managers or their affiliates manage and in some cases own have invested in or provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete with our hotels all of which may result in conflicts of interest as a result our hotel managers have in the past made and may in the future make decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest  we are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor  our thirdparty managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our consolidated hotels other than employing but not managing the associates at our new zealand and australian properties we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force particularly those hotels with unionized labor from time to time hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes lockouts public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity we also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes involving our thirdparty managers and their labor force or other events the resolution of labor disputes or renegotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs a significant component of our costs either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs we do not have the ability to affect the outcome of these negotiations  our hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive in the marketplace maintain brand standards or to comply with applicable laws or regulations the timing and costs of such renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments  we are required by our loan agreements or agreements with our hotel managers to make agreed upon capital expenditures in addition we will need to make further capital expenditures in order to remain competitive with other hotels to maintain the economic value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations the timing of these improvements can affect hotel performance particularly if the improvements require closure of a significant number of rooms or other features of the hotels such as ballrooms meeting space and restaurants these capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost overruns and delays in addition because we depend on external sources of capital we may not have the necessary funds to invest and if we fail to maintain our properties in accordance with brand standards set by our managers the manager may terminate the management agreement moreover we may not necessarily realize a significant or any improvement in the performance of the hotels in which we make these investments  the ownership of hotels outside the united states and the expansion of our business into new markets outside of the united states will expose us to risks relating to owning hotels in those international markets  part of our business strategy is to expand our presence outside of the united states as of december 31 2012 we own directly 15 hotels located outside of the united states we also are party to a joint venture that owns 19 hotels in europe and to a joint venture that owns one hotel in australia and a noncontrolling interest in two hotels    22    table of contents  currently open and five hotels in development in india we may have difficulty managing our expansion into new geographic markets where we have limited knowledge and understanding of the local economy an absence of business relationships in the area or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures and regulations there are risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states which include            employment laws and practices            tax laws which may provide for income or other taxes or tax rates that exceed those of the us and which may provide that foreign earnings that are repatriated directly or indirectly are subject to dividend withholding tax requirements or other restrictions            compliance with and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy            the willingness of domestic or international lenders to provide financing and changes in the availability cost and terms of such financing            adverse changes in local political economic and market conditions            insurance coverage related to terrorist events            changes in interest rates andor currency exchange rates            regulations regarding the incurrence of debt and            difficulties in complying with us rules governing reits while operating outside of the united states  any of these factors could affect adversely our ability to obtain all of the intended benefits of our international country expansion if we do not effectively manage this expansion and successfully integrate the international hotels into our organization our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected  we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts  we have made investments in joint ventures in europe and asia and are exploring further investment opportunities in asia europe and latin america we may from time to time invest as a coventurer in other entities holding hotel properties instead of purchasing hotel properties directly investments in joint ventures may involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions coventurers often share control over the operation of a joint venture actions by a coventurer also could subject the assets to additional risks as a result of any of the following circumstances            our coventurer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our or the joint ventures interests or goals or            our coventurer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives  although generally we will seek to maintain sufficient control of any joint venture in order to permit our objectives to be achieved we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers from focusing their time and effort on our business  our management agreements could affect the sale or financing of our hotels  under the terms of our management agreements we generally may not sell lease or otherwise transfer our hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions our ability to finance or sell our properties depending upon the structure of such transactions may require the managers consent if the manager does not consent to such sale or financing we may be precluded from taking actions in our best interest    23    table of contents we may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts and federal terrorism legislation does not ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future  we obtain terrorism insurance as part of our allrisk property insurance program as well as our general liability and directors and officers coverage however our allrisk policies have limitations such as per occurrence limits annual aggregate coverage limits and sublimits all of which might have to be shared proportionally across participating hotels under certain loss scenarios also allrisk insurers only are required to provide terrorism coverage to the extent mandated by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act tripra property damage related to war and to nuclear radiological biological and chemical incidents is excluded under our policies while tripra will reimburse insurers for losses resulting from nuclear radiological biological and chemical perils tripra does not require insurers to offer coverage for these perils and to date insurers are not willing to provide this coverage even with government reinsurance we have a whollyowned captive insurance company through which we obtain a policy for nuclear biological chemical and radiological nbcr coverage this captive insurer has the same ability as other insurance companies to apply to the us treasury for reimbursement as provided for in tripra and is subject to the same deductibles and coinsurance obligations this potential reimbursement applies to property insurance only and not to general liability or directors and officers insurance and there are no assurances that we will be able to recover any or all of our nbcr losses under this program  some potential losses are not covered by insurance  we or our hotel managers carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability property business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties these policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar types of properties generally our allrisk property policies provide coverage that is available on a peroccurrence basis and that for each occurrence has an overall limit as well as various sublimits on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive sublimits exist for certain types of claims such as service interruption debris removal expediting costs landscaping replacement and natural disasters such as earthquakes floods and hurricanes and may be subject to annual aggregate coverage limits the dollar amounts of these sublimits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit in this regard hotels in certain of our markets including california florida and new zealand have in the past been and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters recovery under the applicable policies also is subject to substantial deductibles and complex calculations of lost business income there is no assurance that this insurance where maintained will fully fund the rebuilding or restoration of a hotel that is impacted by an earthquake hurricane or other natural disaster or the income lost as a result of the damage our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined together for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sublimits contained in our policies have been exceeded and in the case where the manager of one of our hotels provides this coverage any such claims will be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the managers program for the same purpose therefore if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels or in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by the manager affects hotels owned by others the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sublimits depending on the type of claim have been reached each affected hotel only may receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available we may incur losses in excess of insured limits and as a result we may be even less likely to receive complete coverage for risks that affect multiple properties such as earthquakes hurricanes or certain types of terrorism  in addition there are other risks such as certain environmental hazards that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify coverage we also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier we could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel in that event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property    24    table of contents litigation judgments or settlements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition  we have accrued a potential litigation loss of approximately 58 million in connection with a lawsuit in the 166th judicial district court of bexar county texas involving the sale of land encumbered by a ground lease for the san antonio marriott rivercenter see part i item 3 legal proceedings for more information on the verdict and the status of the appeal  we also are involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business and are vigorously defending these claims however no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings we believe based on currently available information that the results of such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but might be material to our operating results for any particular period depending in part upon the operating results for such period  we also could become the subject of future claims by the operators of our hotels individuals or companies who use our hotels our investors our joint venture partners or regulating entities and these claims could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and performance  we may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities related to hotels or businesses we acquire  assets and entities that we have acquired or may in the future acquire may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse or only limited recourse against the sellers in general the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements may not survive long enough for us to become aware of such liabilities and seek recourse against our sellers while usually we require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive such indemnification often is limited and subject to various materiality thresholds a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses as a result there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with acquired hotels and entities may exceed our expectations plus we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects all of which may affect adversely our revenues expenses operating results and financial condition finally indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the assets and entities acquired by us while the sellers generally are contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities without regard to survival limitations materiality thresholds deductibles or caps on losses there can be no guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses in addition to those incurred by the sellers  we depend on our key personnel  our success depends on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel none of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers we cannot assure you that these key personnel will remain employed by us while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our financial performance  exchange rate fluctuations could affect adversely our financial results  as a result of the expansion of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the euro the canadian dollar the mexican peso the australian dollar the new zealand dollar the british pound sterling the polish zloty the brazilian real and the chilean peso in 2012 revenues in these currencies represented approximately 5 of our total revenues although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of these and other foreign currencies these transactions if entered into will not eliminate that risk entirely to the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in the same currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate revenues or earnings in other currencies the conversion of such amounts into us dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our revenues or earnings    25    table of contents applicable reit laws may restrict certain business activities  as a reit host inc is subject to various restrictions on the types of income it can earn assets it can own and activities in which it can engage business activities that could be impacted by applicable reit laws include but are not limited to activities such as developing alternative uses of real estate including the development andor sale of timeshare or condominium units due to these restrictions we anticipate that we will conduct certain business activities including those mentioned above in one or more of our taxable reit subsidiaries our taxable reit subsidiaries are taxable as regular c corporations and are subject to federal state local and if applicable foreign taxation on their taxable income  we may be unable to sell properties because real estate investments are inherently illiquid  real estate properties generally cannot be sold quickly and accordingly we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions the inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could affect adversely our financial condition and the ability to service our debt in addition under the federal income tax laws applicable to reits we may be limited in our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets  our ground lease payments may increase faster than the revenues we receive on the hotels located on the leased properties  as of december 31 2012 38 of our hotels are subject to thirdparty ground leases encumbering all or a portion of the hotel these ground leases generally require periodic increases in ground rent payments which are often based on economic indicators such as the consumer price index our ability to pay ground rent could be affected adversely to the extent that our hotel revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases in addition if we were to sell a hotel encumbered by a ground lease the buyer would be required to assume the ground lease which may result in a lower sales price  environmental problems are possible and can be costly  we believe that our properties comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws unidentified environmental liabilities could arise however and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property the owner or operator may be required to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site environmental laws also govern the presence maintenance and removal of toxic or hazardous substances these laws require that owners or operators of buildings properly manage and maintain these substances and notify and train those who may come into contact with them and undertake special precautions these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to toxic or hazardous materials  compliance with other government regulations can be costly  our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation including title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety under the ada all    26    table of contents  public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons these laws and regulations may be changed from timetotime or new regulations adopted resulting in additional costs of compliance including potential litigation for example the ada was revised substantially in september 2010 and our facilities were required to comply with the new regulations by march 15 2012 a determination that we are not in compliance with the ada could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance imposition of fines or an award of attorneys fees to private litigants compliance with the ada and other laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations  in addition the operations of our international properties are subject to a variety of united states and international laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws but we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international properties might be subject and the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted  risks of ownership of host incs common stock  there are limitations on the acquisition of host inc common stock and changes in control  host incs charter and bylaws the partnership agreement of host lp and the maryland general corporation law the mgcl contain a number of provisions the exercise or existence of which could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for host incs stockholders or host lps unitholders or otherwise be in their best interests including the following            restrictions on transfer and ownership of host incs stock to maintain host incs qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of host incs outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned in the last half of the taxable year directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals which as defined in the code may include certain entities in addition if host inc or one or more owners of 10 or more of host inc actually or constructively owns 10 or more of a tenant of host inc or a tenant of any partnership in which host inc is a partner the rent received by host inc either directly or through any such partnership from such tenant generally will not be qualifying income for purposes of the reit income qualification tests of the code and therefore could jeopardize host incs qualification as a reit unless the tenant qualifies as a trs and certain other requirements are met  accordingly host incs charter prohibits ownership directly or by attribution by any person or persons acting as a group of more than 98 in value or number whichever is more restrictive of shares of host incs outstanding common stock preferred stock or any other class or series of stock each considered as a separate class or series for this purpose together these limitations are referred to as the ownership limit  stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the intended acquirer of the stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any distributions thereon to vote those shares of stock or to receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the stock in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the stock or the amount realized from the sale a transfer of shares of host incs stock to a person who as a result of the transfer violates the ownership limit may be void under certain circumstances and in any event would deny that person any of the economic benefits of owning shares of host incs stock in excess of the ownership limit these restrictions will not apply if host incs board of directors determines that it is no longer in host incs best interests to continue to qualify as a reit or that compliance with the restrictions on transfer and ownership is no longer required for host inc to qualify as a reit            removal of board of directors host incs charter provides that except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or series of shares of capital stock other than common stock directors may be removed only for cause and by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least twothirds of all    27    table of contents       the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors vacancies on host incs board of directors may be filled at any regular meeting or at any special meeting called for that purpose by the affirmative vote of the remaining directors except that a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the entire board of directors any vacancy resulting from the removal of a director by the stockholders may be filled by the affirmative vote of holders of at least twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors            preferred shares classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval host incs charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that host inc has authority to issue is 1100000000 consisting of 1050000000 shares of common stock and 50000000 shares of preferred stock host incs board of directors has the authority without a vote of stockholders to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock and to establish the terms preferences conversion or other rights voting powers restrictions limitations as to dividends and other distributions qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series because host incs board of directors has this power it may give the holders of any class or series of stock terms preferences powers and rights including voting rights senior to the rights of holders of existing stock            certain provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a thirdparty to acquire control of host inc certain provisions of the mgcl may have the effect of inhibiting a thirdparty from acquiring host inc including            business combination provisions that subject to limitations prohibit certain business combinations between a corporation and an interested stockholder defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of the corporations then outstanding shares of voting stock or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who at any time within the two year period immediately prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation or an affiliate of any interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and thereafter imposes two supermajority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations and            control share provisions that provide that holders of control shares of a corporation defined as voting shares of stock that if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned or controlled by the acquirer would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors acquired in a control share acquisition defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding all interested shares  host inc is subject to the maryland business combination statute our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share provisions of the mgcl there can be no assurance that this bylaw provision exempting us from the control share provisions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future  additionally title 3 subtitle 8 of the mgcl permits our board of directors without stockholder approval and regardless of what currently is provided in our charter or bylaws to implement certain takeover defenses such as a classified board some of which we do not have            merger consolidation share exchange and transfer of host incs assets under maryland law and host incs charter subject to the terms of any outstanding class or series of capital stock we can merge with or into another entity consolidate with one or more other entities participate in a share exchange or transfer host incs assets within the meaning of the mgcl if approved 1 by host incs board of directors in the manner provided in the mgcl and 2 by host incs stockholders holding twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter except that any merger of host inc with or into a trust organized for the purpose of changing host incs form of organization from a corporation to a trust    28    table of contents       requires only the approval of host incs stockholders holding a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the merger under the mgcl specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange only is required to be approved by the board of directors of a maryland corporation if the corporation is the successor entity host incs voluntary dissolution also would require approval of stockholders holding twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter            certain charter and bylaw amendments host incs charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transfer and ownership of host incs stock fixing the size of the board of directors within the range set forth in the charter removal of directors the filling of vacancies exculpation and indemnification of directors calling special stockholder meetings and others all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the board of directors and approved by host incs stockholders holding twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter other charter amendments generally require approval of the board and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter as permitted under the mgcl host incs charter and bylaws provide that the board of directors has the exclusive right to amend host incs bylaws these provisions may make it more difficult to amend host incs charter and bylaws to alter the provisions described herein that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control or the acquisition of host inc common stock without the approval of the board of directors  shares of host incs common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share price of host incs common stock  we may issue additional shares of common stock to raise the capital necessary to finance hotel acquisitions fund capital expenditures refinance debt or for other corporate purposes sales of a substantial number of shares of host incs common stock or the perception that sales could occur could affect adversely prevailing market prices for host incs common stock in addition holders of op units who redeem their units and receive at host incs election shares of host inc common stock will be able to sell those shares freely as of december 31 2012 there are approximately 99 million op units outstanding owned by third parties that are redeemable which represents approximately 14 of all outstanding units further a substantial number of shares of host incs common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans we maintain two stockbased compensation plans i the comprehensive stock plan whereby we may award to participating employees and directors restricted shares of common stock options to purchase common stock and deferred shares of common stock and ii an employee stock purchase plan at december 31 2012 there were approximately 19 million shares of host incs common stock reserved and available for issuance under the comprehensive stock plan and employee stock purchase plan and 10 million outstanding options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of 986 per share  also as of december 31 2012 host lp had outstanding 575 million principal amount of exchangeable senior debentures that could become exchangeable under certain conditions for shares of host incs common stock although the exchange conditions currently have not been satisfied these debentures would be exchangeable for approximately 41 million shares based on the current exchange prices for 400 million of such exchangeable debentures however host inc has the option to issue cash shares of host incs common stock or any combination thereof in settlement of the debentures should they be presented for exchange  on april 24 2012 host inc entered into two sales financing agreements one with each of bny mellon capital markets llc and scotia capital usa inc through which host inc may issue and sell from time to time shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 400 million the sales will be made in at the market offerings under sec rules including sales made directly on the new york stock exchange each of bny mellon capital markets llc and scotia capital usa inc is acting as sales agent host inc may sell shares of common stock under its program from time to time based on market conditions although it is not under an obligation to sell any shares as of december 31 2012 approximately 100 million of host incs common stock have been issued and sold pursuant to the program shares of host incs common stock having an aggregate offering price of approximately 300 million remain issuable from time to time under the agreements any additional shares of common stock issued by host inc whether issued under this program or otherwise would be available in the future for sale in the public markets    29    table of contents our earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of host incs common stock  we believe that the market value of a reits equity securities is based primarily upon the markets perception of the reits growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions whether from operations sales acquisitions development or refinancings and secondarily is based upon the value of the underlying assets for that reason shares of host incs common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may impact negatively the market price of host incs common stock our failure to meet the markets expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would affect adversely the market price of host incs common stock  market interest rates may affect the price of shares of host incs common stock  we believe that one of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a reit is the dividend rate on the shares considered as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of reit shares may expect a higher dividend rate thus higher market interest rates could cause the market price of host incs common stock to decrease  federal income tax risks  to qualify as a reit each of host inc and its subsidiary reits are required to distribute at least 90 of its taxable income excluding net capital gain regardless of available cash or outstanding obligations  to continue to qualify as a reit host inc is required to distribute to its stockholders with respect to each year at least 90 of its taxable income excluding net capital gain to the extent that host inc satisfies this distribution requirement but distributes less than 100 of its taxable income and net capital gain for the taxable year it will be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition host inc will be subject to a nondeductible 4 excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by host inc with respect to the calendar year are less than the sum of 1 85 of its ordinary income 2 95 of its net capital gain and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior years less excess distributions from prior years host inc intends to make distributions subject to the availability of cash and in compliance with any debt covenants to its stockholders in order to comply with the distribution requirement and to avoid the imposition of a significant nondeductible 4 excise tax and will rely for this purpose on distributions from host lp and its subsidiaries there are differences in timing between host incs recognition of taxable income and its receipt of cash available for distribution due to among other things the seasonality of the lodging industry and the fact that some taxable income will be phantom taxable income which is taxable income that is not matched by cash flow due to transactions entered into in years prior to host incs conversion to a reit host inc could recognize substantial amounts of phantom taxable income in the future it is possible that any differences between the recognition of taxable income and the receipt of the related cash could require us to borrow funds or for host inc to issue additional equity in order to enable host inc to meet its distribution requirements and therefore to maintain its reit status and to avoid the nondeductible 4 excise tax in addition because the reit distribution requirements prevent host inc from retaining earnings generally we will be required to refinance debt at its maturity with additional debt or equity it is possible that any of these sources of funds if available at all would not be sufficient to meet host incs distribution and tax obligations  host lp owns 100 of the outstanding common stock and a portion of the outstanding preferred stock of two entities that have elected to be treated as reits each of these subsidiary reits are subject to the same requirements that host inc must satisfy in order to qualify as a reit including the distribution requirements described above  adverse tax consequences would occur if host inc or any of its subsidiary reits fail to qualify as a reit  we believe that host inc has been organized and has operated in such a manner so as to qualify as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year beginning january 1 1999 and host inc currently intends to    30    table of contents  continue to operate as a reit during future years in addition host inc owns through host lp two entities that have elected to be treated as reits as the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a reit are limited no assurance can be provided that host inc currently qualifies as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit or that each of host incs subsidiary reits qualify as a reit if any of the subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit it is possible that host inc would fail to qualify as a reit unless it or the subsidiary reit could avail itself of certain relief provisions new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change significantly the tax laws with respect to an entitys qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of its reit qualification if host inc or any of the subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit and any available relief provisions did not apply the nonqualifying reit would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates moreover unless entitled to statutory relief the nonqualifying reit would not qualify as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which reit qualification was lost  any determination that host inc or one of its subsidiary reits does not qualify as a reit will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could materially reduce the value of host incs common stock the additional tax liability of host inc or the subsidiary reit for the year or years in which the relevant entity did not qualify as a reit would reduce its net earnings available for investment debt service or distributions to stockholders furthermore the nonqualifying entity no longer would be required to make distributions to stockholders as a condition to reit qualification and all of its distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary c corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that if host inc were to fail to qualify as a reit host incs stockholders currently taxed as individuals would be taxed on those dividends at capital gain rates and host incs corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the code host incs failure to qualify as a reit also would cause an event of default under host lps credit facility which default could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due thereunder which in turn would constitute an event of default under host lps outstanding debt securities  if our leases are not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes each of host inc and its subsidiary reits would fail to qualify as a reit  to qualify as a reit host inc must satisfy two gross income tests pursuant to which specified percentages of its gross income must be passive income such as rent for the rent paid pursuant to the hotel leases with our trs which rental income currently constitutes substantially all of host incs and each of our subsidiary reits gross income to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests our leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and must not be treated as service contracts joint ventures or some other type of arrangement we believe that the leases will be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance however that the internal revenue service irs will agree with this characterization if the leases were not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes neither host inc nor either of our subsidiary reits would be able to satisfy either of the two gross income tests applicable to reits and each likely would lose its reit status  if our affiliated lessees fail to qualify as taxable reit subsidiaries each of host inc and its subsidiary reits would fail to qualify as a reit  rent paid by a lessee that is a related party tenant of host inc will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to reits we lease substantially all of our hotels to our subsidiary that is taxable as a regular c corporation and that has elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary with respect to host inc so long as any affiliated lessee qualifies as a taxable reit subsidiary it will not be treated as a related party tenant we believe that our affiliated lessees have qualified and will continue to qualify and that the taxable reit subsidiaries of each of our subsidiary reits have qualified and will continue to qualify to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance however that the irs will not challenge the status of a taxable reit subsidiary for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in disqualifying any of our affiliated lessees including the taxable reit subsidiaries of our subsidiary reits from treatment as a taxable reit subsidiary it is possible that    31    table of contents  host inc or a subsidiary reit would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to reits and substantially all of its income would fail to qualify for the gross income tests if host inc or a subsidiary reit failed to meet either the asset tests or the gross income tests each likely would lose its reit status  despite the reit status of each of host inc and its subsidiary reits we remain subject to various taxes  one of the subsidiary reits of host inc will be required to pay federal income tax at the highest regular corporate rate on builtin gain recognized as a result of the sale of one or more of its hotel assets prior to the expiration of the applicable 10year holding period including certain hotels acquired from starwood and its affiliates in 2006 the total amount of gain on which the subsidiary reit would be subject to corporate income tax if all of its builtin gain assets were sold in a taxable transaction prior to the expiration of the applicable 10year holding period would be material to it in addition we expect that we could recognize other substantial deferred tax liabilities in the future without any corresponding receipt of cash  notwithstanding host incs status as a reit host inc and our subsidiaries including our subsidiary reits are subject to some federal state local and foreign taxes on their income and property for example host inc and our subsidiary reits will pay tax on certain types of income that are not distributed and will be subject to a 100 excise tax on transactions with a taxable reit subsidiary that are not conducted on an arms length basis moreover the taxable reit subsidiaries of host inc and our subsidiary reits are taxable as regular c corporations and will pay federal state and local income tax on their net income at the applicable corporate rates and foreign taxes to the extent that they own assets or conduct operations in international jurisdictions  host lp is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes and any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc  if the irs were to challenge successfully host lps status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes host inc would cease to qualify as a reit and would suffer other adverse consequences  we believe that host lp qualifies to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership it is not subject to federal income tax on its income instead each of its partners including host inc is required to report and pay tax if applicable on such partners allocable share of its income no assurance can be provided however that the irs will not challenge host lps status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating host lp as a corporation for federal income tax purposes host inc would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to reits and accordingly cease to qualify as a reit if host lp fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or host inc fails to qualify as a reit either failure would cause an event of default under host lps credit facility that in turn could constitute an event of default under host lps outstanding debt securities also the failure of host lp to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes would cause it to become subject to federal state and foreign corporate income tax which tax would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners including host inc  as a reit each of host inc and its subsidiary reits is subject to limitations on its ownership of debt and equity securities  subject to certain exceptions a reit generally is prohibited from owning securities in any one issuer to the extent that 1 the value of such securities exceeds 5 of the value of the reits total assets 2 the securities owned by the reit represent more than 10 of the issuers outstanding voting securities or 3 the reit owns more than 10 of the value of the issuers outstanding securities a reit is permitted to own securities of a subsidiary in an amount that exceeds the 5 value test and the 10 vote or value test if the subsidiary elects to be a taxable reit subsidiary however a reit may not own securities of taxable reit subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 25 of the value of the reits total assets if host inc or any of its subsidiary reits were to violate these ownership limitations each likely would lose its reit status    32    table of contents each of host inc or its subsidiary reits may be required to pay a penalty tax upon the sale of a hotel  the federal income tax provisions applicable to reits provide that any gain realized by a reit on the sale of property held as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100 excise tax under existing law whether property including hotels is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is a question of fact that depends upon all of the facts and circumstances with respect to the particular transaction we intend to hold our hotels for investment with a view to longterm appreciation to engage in the business of acquiring and owning hotels and to make occasional sales of hotels consistent with our investment objectives there can be no assurance however that the irs might not contend that one or more of these sales are subject to the 100 excise tax  risks relating to redemption of op units  a holder who offers its op units for redemption may have adverse tax consequences  a holder whose op units are redeemed will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as having sold the op units the sale of these units is a taxable event and the holder thereof will be treated as realizing an amount equal to the sum of 1 the value of the common stock or cash the holder receives and 2 the amount of host lps nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units the gain or loss recognized by the holder of op units is measured by the difference between the amount realized by the holder and the holders basis in the op units redeemed which basis includes the amount of host lps nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units it is possible that the amount of gain andor the tax liability related thereto that the holder recognizes and pays could exceed the value of the common stock or cash that the holder receives  if a holder of op units elects to offer them for redemption the original receipt of the op units may be subject to tax  if a holder of op units elects to have its units redeemed particularly within two years of receiving them there is a risk that the original receipt of the op units may be treated as a taxable sale under the disguised sale rules of the internal revenue code subject to several exceptions the tax law generally provides that a partners contribution of property to a partnership and a simultaneous or subsequent transfer of money or other consideration from the partnership to the partner will be presumed to be a taxable sale in particular if money or other consideration is transferred by a partnership to a partner within two years of the partners contribution of property the transactions are presumed to be a taxable sale of the contributed property unless the facts and circumstances clearly establish that the transfers are not a sale on the other hand if two years have passed between the original contribution of property and the transfer of money or other consideration the transactions will not be presumed to be a taxable sale unless the facts and circumstances clearly establish that they should be so treated  differences between an investment in shares of host inc common stock and op units may affect redeemed holders of op units  if a holder of op units elects to have op units redeemed we will determine whether the holder receives cash or shares of host incs common stock in exchange for the op units although an investment in shares of host incs common stock is substantially similar to an investment in op units there are some differences between ownership of op units and ownership of host inc common stock these differences include form of organization management structure voting rights liquidity and federal income taxation some of which may be material to investors      item 1b unresolved staff comments  none      item 2 properties  see part 1 item 1 business  our hotel properties above for a discussion of our hotels    33    table of contents   item 3 legal proceedings  on april 27 2005 we initiated a lawsuit against keystonetexas property holding corporation keystone seeking a declaration that a provision of the ground lease for the property under the san antonio marriott rivercenter was valid and claiming that keystone had breached that lease provision on october 18 2006 keystone filed an amended counterclaim and later a third party claim alleging that we had tortiously interfered with keystones attempted sale of the property and that we slandered keystones title to the property  on february 8 2010 we received an adverse jury verdict in the 166th judicial district court of bexar county texas the jury found that we tortiously interfered with the attempted sale by keystone of the land under the san antonio marriott rivercenter and awarded keystone 343 million in damages plus statutory interest in addition the jury found that we slandered keystones title to the property and awarded keystone 39 million in damages plus statutory interest keystone only will be entitled to receive one of these damage awards on

table of contents   item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report  overview  host inc operates as a selfmanaged and selfadministered reit that owns properties and conducts operations through host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and in which it holds approximately 986 of host lps common op units as of december 31 2012 the remaining approximate 14 of host lps common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lps daytoday management and control  host inc is the largest lodging reit in nareits composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotel properties we currently own 118 hotels in the united states and internationally and have minority ownership interests in an additional 22 hotels through joint ventures in europe and the asiapacific region these hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry the majority are located in central business districts of major cities near airports and in resortconference destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors since 2000 the percentage of revenues generated by our urban and resortconference hotels has increased from 64 to 80 in 2012 as we have focused our acquisition efforts on these hotel types and similarly disposed of noncore assets while hotels in these markets still are subject to competitive pressures we believe this strategy of combining premium brands with superior locations provides opportunities to achieve room rate and occupancy premiums in excess of our competitors  our customers  the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient business group business and contract business which accounted for approximately 60 35 and 5 respectively of our 2012 room sales similar to the majority of the lodging industry we further categorize business within these categories based on characteristics they have in common as follows  transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels therefore we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel versus leisure demand the three key subcategories of the transient business group are            retail this is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the general public it typically is for travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discount rates it includes the rack rate which typically is applied to rooms during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available retail room rates will fluctuate more freely depending on anticipated demand levels eg seasonality and weekday vs weekend stays            special corporate this is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally these rates typically are negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated retail rate            discount this category encompasses all discount programs such as aaa and aarp discounts government per diem rooms booked through wholesale channels frequent guest program redemptions and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel  group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together usually with a minimum of 10 rooms the three key subcategories of the group business category are            association group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions            corporate group business related to corporate meetings eg product launches training programs contract negotiations and presentations            other group business predominately related to social military education religious fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams otherwise known as smerf business    42    table of contents the final category is contract business which refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates contract rates usually are utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels  understanding our performance  our revenues and expenses our hotels are operated by thirdparty managers under longterm agreements pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel we provide operating funds or working capital which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages utilities property taxes and other hotellevel expenses we generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month which distribution reflects hotellevel sales less propertylevel operating expenses excluding depreciation  revenue from owned hotels represents 95 of our total revenue the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue                       of 2012revenues        rooms revenue occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue the business mix of the hotel group versus transient and premium versus discount business is a significant driver of room rates     61            food and beverage revenue occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel are the major drivers of food and beverage revenue ie group business typically generates more food and beverage business through catering functions when compared to transient business which may or may not utilize the hotels restaurants     28            other revenue occupancy the nature of the property ie resort etc and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue such as parking golf course spa entertainment and other guest services     6    hotel operating expenses represent approximately 98 of our total operating costs and expenses the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses                       of 2012operatingcosts andexpenses        rooms expense these costs include housekeeping reservation systems room supplies laundry services and front desk costs occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages as well as on the level of service and amenities that are provided     18            food and beverage expense these expenses primarily include food beverage and labor costs occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel ie catered functions generally are more profitable than outlet sales are the major drivers of food and beverage expense which correlates closely with food and beverage revenue     23     43    table of contents                    of 2012operatingcosts andexpenses        other departmental and support expenses these expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenue such as parking golf courses spas entertainment and other guest services as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments sales and marketing repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs     26            management fees base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels     4            other propertylevel expenses these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes ground rent equipment rent and property insurance many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenue at our hotels     12            depreciation and amortization expense this is a noncash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of past capital expenditures     15    the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations it also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items taken separately these costs represent approximately 55 of our hotel operating expenses  key performance indicators revenue per available room revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved revpar does not include food and beverage or parking telephone or other guest service revenues generated by the property although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues it generally is considered the key indicator of core revenues for many hotels  revpar changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels as well as incremental operating profit than do changes that are driven by average room rate for example increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues such as food and beverage revenue as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services utilities and room amenity costs revpar increases due to higher room rates however would not result in additional roomrelated costs with the exception of those charged as a percentage of revenue as a result changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than changes in revpar caused by occupancy levels  in discussing our operating results we present revpar and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and whose operations have been included in our consolidated results comparable hotels

based on 104 comparable hotels as of december 31 2011  in 2012 revpar at our comparable hotels increased 64 compared to 2011 marking the third straight year of comparable revpar growth of approximately 6 while the overall growth in the economy since the 20082009 recession has been slow particularly with regards to gdp growth and the continued high unemployment specific    45    table of contents  drivers of lodging demand have proven to be more resilient allowing for steady revpar improvements in particular corporate business which is one of the most important demand drivers of our portfolio has strengthened as corporate profits and business investment have increased at a much greater rate than the overall economy additionally our properties in gateway markets such as new york san francisco los angeles seattle boston miami and chicago have benefited from an increase in demand from travel to the us as international arrivals increased 7 through september 2012 based on the most recent available report from the office of travel and tourism industries  growth in 2012 at our comparable hotels was both rate and occupancy driven as room rates improved 36 and occupancy improved 200 basis points to 745 which is one percentage point above our prerecession occupancy levels in 2007 as we enter the third full year of the lodging recovery our operators have been able to gradually increase room rates particularly for our transient business as the occupancy levels at our properties have continued to improve the occupancy improvement for the year was driven by an increase in demand from our corporate group business as reflected in a 4 increase in group room nights compared to 2011  food and beverage revenues at our comparable hotels increased 39 for 2012 the increase was driven primarily by improvements in banquet and audio visual revenues during the first half of the year while outlet revenue improved during the second half of the year banquet and audio visual revenues provide higher overall operating margins than outlet revenue as catered functions generally are more profitable overall food and beverage revenues increased by 64 compared to 2011 which includes incremental food and beverage revenues from recently acquired hotels of 31 million  as a result total revenues for our owned hotels increased 342 million to 50 billion for the year in addition to the hotel revenues for our owned hotels described above our other revenues increased 20 million which was due primarily to increased revenue from the 53 courtyard by marriott hotels leased from hospitality properties trust hpt accordingly total revenues increased 362 million to approximately 53 billion for 2012 approximately 99 million of the increase both in total revenues and revenues for owned hotels resulted from the inclusion of operations from recently acquired hotels including the grand hyatt washington which was purchased in july 2012 and a full year of operations for 10 hotels purchased in the first quarter of 2011  operating margins calculated based on gaap operating profit as a percentage of gaap revenues increased 60 basis points for the full year 2012 operating margins are affected significantly by several items including operations from recently acquired hotels depreciation impairments and corporate expenses our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins which exclude these and other items increased 140 basis points to 240 our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins were impacted positively by the 36 increase in average room rate as well as a 55 decline in utilities expense  net income loss for host inc improved 79 million in 2012 to a net income of 63 million and adjusted ebitda increased 172 million or 169 to 12 billion net income was impacted negatively by a 60 million noncash impairment charge in 2012 related to the westin mission hills resort amp spa partially offset by a 48 million gain from asset sales  during 2012 host incs diluted income loss per common share improved 10 per share to income of 08 per share the improvement in our income per diluted share reflects the improvement in operating results at our hotels as described above host incs adjusted ffo per diluted share increased 196 to 110 per share for 2012  the trends and transactions described above for host inc affected similarly the operating results for host lp as the only significant difference between the host inc and host lp statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the outside partners of host lp for the year host lps net income loss improved 79 million to income of 63 million and the diluted income loss per common diluted unit improved 11 per unit to income of 09 per unit    46    table of

growth potential that will provide returns at attractive premiums to our cost of capital while the global economic outlook remains unclear the ongoing strength of hotel performance particularly in gateway markets due to limited new supply and the increasing availability of debt creates a favorable environment for hotel transactions our acquisition strategy also includes the acquisition or

amsterdam for approximately 440 million 572 million and the payment of 10 million 13 million for the ffampe replacement fund the acquisition was financed in part through the issuance of 250 million 325 million of mortgage debt  we contributed approximately 80 million 103 million in connection with these acquisitions which also includes closing costs of 9 million 11 million in connection with the acquisition of the portfolio of five hotels we received 62 million 80 million for our interest in the mortgage loan secured by the hotels that was repaid at closing which we had acquired for 40

substantially expand the existing retail space including the conversion of belowgrade parking to highend retail space and sixstory block front led signage that is expected to improve the hotels presence on times square as a result of the lease our rental income increased by more than 6 million annually and we would expect significant additional rent increases as the project is completed and leased over the term of the lease each party has options that if exercised would result in ownership of the retail space being conveyed to vornado at a price based on the future cash flow of the leased property            we also are under contract with a luxury homebuilder to sell 42 acres of excess land adjacent to our newport beach marriott hotel amp spa the land which previously was used

redevelopment and return on investment capital expenditures redevelopment and roi projects primarily consist of largescale redevelopment projects as well as nearterm capital and operational improvement plans at our newly acquired properties which we refer to as acquisition projects during 2012 and 2011 we invested 128 million and 13 million respectively in acquisition projects and 144 million and 202 million respectively in other projects for a total of 272 million and 215 million respectively in redevelopment and roi expenditures during 2013 we plan to spend between 40 million to 50 million in acquisition expenditures and 90 million to 100 million for other projects for total redevelopment and roi expenditures of 130 million to 150 million in 2012 we continued to implement various projects that were designed specifically to increase the ecoefficiency of our hotels incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology significant redevelopment capital expenditures during the year included the following projects            the redevelopment projects that began in 2011 at the following three properties were completed the atlanta marriott perimeter center the chicago marriott ohare and the sheraton indianapolis these properties have experienced an average revpar increase of 41 for 2012 when compared

begun in 2010 which in 2012 included the completion of the south tower greatroom redesign of the bar restaurant and grab amp go outlet            orlando world center marriott  we began the complete enhancement of the pool area including new water slides and activity areas and new pool dining facilities  included in our roi expenditures are capital projects at our recently acquired hotels that we

table of contents renewal and replacement capital expenditures we spent 366 million and 327 million on renewal and replacement expenditures during 2012 and 2011 respectively these projects included the renovation of over 6500 rooms 100000 square feet of public space and 500000 square feet of meeting space in 2012 these expenditures are designed to ensure that our high standards for product quality are maintained and to enhance the overall competitiveness of our properties in the marketplace major projects completed in 2012 included the renovation of 1100 rooms at the boston marriott copley place all 834 guestrooms at the hyatt regency washington on capitol hill all 891 rooms at the westin seattle over 33000 square feet of meeting space at the ritzcarlton buckhead almost 10500 square feet of meeting space at the w new york and the renovation of 978 guestrooms and the 45000 square foot exhibit hall in the new york marriott marquis major renewal and replacement projects that

meeting space at the westin kierland resort amp spa we expect that our investment in renewal and replacement expenditures in 2013 will total approximately 270 million to 290 million at the midpoint of this range this represents an approximate 20 decrease when compared to 2012 and should result in less business disruption at our properties  dispositions we disposed of four properties over the last 12 months including the sale of the atlanta marriott marquis on january 11 2013 for 445 million including 26 million of ffampe replacement funds while two of the sales were smaller properties in noncore markets the disposition of the san francisco airport marriott and the atlanta marriott marquis hotels represented opportunities to capitalize on favorable market conditions and rebalance the investments in our portfolio for example the sale of the atlanta marriott marquis reduced our overall market presence in atlanta which now represents approximately 3 of our total revenues during 2013 we believe that transaction volume in the industry will increase as the year progresses and we plan to remain opportunistic with our disposition activity  financing activities  we continued to make progress in 2012 on our goal to strengthen our balance sheet by lowering our debttoequity ratio and improving our overall credit statistics we believe that lower leverage reduces our overall cost of capital and our earnings volatility and increases our access to capital thereby providing us with the necessary flexibility to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging cycle which we consider a key competitive advantage as our operations have improved we have focused strategically on raising and deploying capital to improve our leverage ratios while at the same time completing substantial investments in our portfolio through acquisitions and capital investments during the year we issued approximately 15 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 37 and used the proceeds thereof along with available cash to repay approximately 19 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 67 as a result of these transactions we have decreased our weighted average interest rate by 90 basis points to 54 and lengthened our weighted average debt maturity by 07 years to 51 years specifically during the year we completed the following significant financing transactions            we issued 450 million of 4 34 series c senior notes due 2023 for net proceeds of approximately 443 million and 350 million 5 14 series b senior notes due 2022 for net proceeds of approximately 344 million            we entered into a 500 million term loan through an amendment of our credit facility the term loan has a fiveyear maturity and a floating interest rate of libor plus 180 basis points based on our leverage ratio at december 31 2012 we also drew approximately 142 million on a net basis in 2012 on the revolving portion of our credit facility            we redeemed a total of nearly 18 billion of senior notes and exchangeable debentures            we repaid the 113 million loan with a 75 interest rate on the jw marriott washington dc and issued a 100 million mortgage loan secured by the hyatt regency reston the new loan bears interest at 1month libor plus 310 basis points and matures on july 1 2016 with an additional oneyear extension at our option subject to debt service and loantovalue requirements and other conditions            we issued 175 million common shares under our at the market offering programs the shares were issued at an average price of 1567 per share for net proceeds of 271 million    49    table of contents we believe based on the overall strength of our balance sheet that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to pay our nearterm debt maturities fund our capital expenditures programs and take advantage of investment opportunities for a detailed discussion see liquidity and capital resources  2013 outlook  we believe that the broad economic trends experienced between 2010 and 2012 should continue in 2013 which likely will translate into moderate growth in lodging demand real us gdp growth is anticipated to be 20 in 2013 based on consensus estimates the slightly muted economic growth prospects in the us relate to the increased tax rates in 2013 as well as continued uncertainty regarding us tax and spending policies and continued elevated unemployment levels we anticipate that this uncertainty also will lead to more moderate growth in business investment particularly in the first half of the year which historically has been correlated to lodging demand we expect slower economic growth in europe which will affect demand negatively though key urban markets such as london and paris should outperform the market as a whole we expect economic growth in the asiapacific and latin america regions to accelerate which should bolster lodging demand both for our international properties and our properties located in key domestic gateway markets  supply growth for upperupscale and luxury hotels is expected to increase from 2012 levels but remain well below the longterm industry trend as is typical in the lodging cycle supply growth has lagged the recovery in demand due to the long term planning required for hotel development during the current recovery supply growth also has been hampered first by the lack of available credit during the recession and second by the slow pace of the recovery as on average upperupscale hotels in gateway markets continue to trade below replacement cost demand has therefore increased at a faster pace than supply resulting in strong occupancy increases which is reflected in our strong booking pace for 2013 we continue to expect demand to outpace supply in 2013 resulting in a modest increase in occupancy which we believe will allow operators to shift focus toward improving the mix of business and driving average daily rate increases therefore revpar growth is anticipated to be driven primarily by average daily rate which should provide an opportunity to drive operating profits  we also believe that our hotels will benefit in 2013 from the improvements made to our portfolio through our capital expenditures program and acquisitions we spent over 600 million on major redevelopment and return on investment capital projects between 2010 and 2012 that we believe have improved significantly the competitive position of our properties while taking advantage of reduced occupancies and significantly lower construction costs we expect that the pace of our capital spending will slow in 2013 which will lessen the disruption experienced compared to 2011 and 2012  based on the trends discussed above as well as our forecasts for our properties we believe that comparable hotel revpar will increase 5 to 7 for 2013 additionally we believe that comparable food and beverage and other revenue will increase approximately 2 to 4 for 2013 however there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons including but not limited to slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns see part i item 1a risk factors    50    table of contents results of operations  the

discussion of the reporting periods for our comparable hotel results see comparable hotel operating statistics  reporting periods  for 2011 comparable hotel revpar improved across all of our geographic regions when compared to 2010 our pacific region was the top performing region with a revpar increase of 123 that was driven by strong group and transient demand in our hawaiian san diego and san francisco markets  the 88 revpar improvement in our mountain region was driven primarily by strong growth in the phoenix market which increased by 133 for 2011 the increase in the phoenix market was a result of strong group demand aided by the construction of a new ballroom and meeting space at the westin kierland in 2010 as well as increases in both group and transient rates  the north central region had an increase in revpar of 62 led by our chicago market which had increases in both transient and group demand resulting in revpar growth of 69  revpar in our south central region grew 58 for the year driven mainly by our houston market which saw strong increases in rate of 55 and occupancy of 35 percentage points as a result of an increase in retail and corporate transient demand  results in our florida region were mixed the miami and ft lauderdale market experienced a 73 percentage point improvement in occupancy primarily due to strong group demand aided by the renovation of the miami biscayne bay marriott which was completed in 2010 revpar growth at our orlando world center marriott had an increase of just 1 due to lower than expected group demand  the revpar growth in our midatlantic region of 43 lagged the portfolio as a whole due to lower levels of rate growth and the effect of new supply in the new york market as well as significant renovations at the sheraton new york times square hotel and the philadelphia marriott downtown  our dc metro and atlanta regions underperformed the portfolio as a whole with revpar growth of 15 and 13 respectively for our dc metro market weak group and transient demand along with discounted leisure rates slowed rate growth our atlanta market was affected negatively by the decline in citywide demand as well as renovations at the jw marriott buckhead particularly in the second half of 2011    56    table of contents hotel sales by business mix the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient group and contract business the information below is derived from business mix data for 104 of our hotels for which 2011 and 2010 comparable hotel information is available from our managers in 2011 overall transient revenues increased 69 when compared to 2010 reflecting a 46 improvement in average rate and a 22 increase in room nights average daily rates improved consistently for all transient segments the improvement in transient demand was driven by increases in special corporate room nights during 2011 group revenues increased approximately 53 average daily rates improved 34 reflecting a consistent rate growth for all group customer segments overall group demand improved 17 for the year the improvement was due entirely to an increase in demand in the corporate group segment as association and other group business declined during 2011  propertylevel operating expenses  the following table presents consolidated propertylevel operating expenses in accordance

                   2012 compared to 2011 and 2011 compared to 2010 our operating costs and expenses both of which consist of fixed and variable components are affected by a number of factors as previously discussed room expense is affected mainly by occupancy which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping reservation systems room supplies laundry services and front desk costs food and beverage expense correlates closely with food and beverage revenues and is affected by occupancy as well as the type of customers staying at the hotel however the most significant expense for both room expense and food and beverage expense is related to wages and employee benefits which comprise approximately 55 of these expenses in any year other propertylevel expenses consist of property taxes which are highly dependent on local taxing authorities and property and general liability insurance and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels the overall increases in operating expenses in 2012 and 2011 are consistent with higher overall revpar and increases in occupancy and rates at our hotels the yearoveryear increases also reflect the incremental expenses from our recently acquired properties for 2012 the recently acquired properties include the grand hyatt washington that was purchased in july 2012 and a full year of operations for 10 hotels acquired in 2011 the increase in 2011 compared to 2010 reflects the inclusion of the 2011 acquisitions as well as a full year of operations for four hotels acquired in 2010 propertylevel operating expenses for hotels sold during the periods presented have been reclassified as discontinued operations  rooms room expenses increased 59 million to 875 million during 2012 reflecting an increase of 55 at our comparable hotels the increase at our comparable hotels is a result of higher occupancy as well as higher wage rates and benefits room expenses for 2012 also increased an incremental 19 million as a result of recently acquired hotels the increase in room expenses for 2011 was consistent with the overall increase in occupancy during the year and higher wage costs combined with an incremental 59 million as a result of recently acquired hotels  food and beverage fampb expenses increased 61 million to 1105 million during 2012 the increase was a result of a 36 increase at our comparable hotels reflecting higher wages and benefits partially offset by a slight improvement in productivity overall the cost increase is inline with the increase in comparable fampb revenues growth in the food and beverage department for the second half of the year was driven largely by improvements at our outlets which generally have a lower overall operating margin than banquet revenues fampb expenses for 2012 also increased an incremental 21 million as a result of recently acquired hotels the increase in fampb costs for 2011 reflect an increase in fampb revenues partially offset by an increase in productivity combined with an incremental 54 million as a result of recently acquired hotels    57    table of contents other departmental and support expenses other departmental and support expenses increased 42 million to 1282 million the increase was driven primarily by higher sales and marketing expenses which are variable and dependent upon revenues such as loyalty rewards expense and national sales allocations these increases partially were offset by lower centralized accounting charges and lower utility rates and consumption recently acquired hotels also increased other departmental and support expenses by an incremental 24 million in 2012 the increase in other departmental and support costs in 2011 resulted from an incremental 67 million from recently acquired hotels as well as an increase in sales and marketing and administrative expenses  management fees management fees which generally are calculated as a percentage of revenues and operating profit increased 107 to 207 million for 2012 which is consistent with our overall improvement in revenues and operating profits our management fees include 4 million of incremental costs from recently acquired hotels for 2012 base management fees which generally are calculated as a percentage of total revenues increased 10 million in 2012 incentive management fees which generally are calculated based on operating profit after a preferred return increased 12 million for the year management fees increased 18 million for 2011 including 10 million of incremental costs from hotels acquired in 2011 base management fees and incentive management fees increased 14 million and 5 million respectively for 2011  other propertylevel expenses these expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance other propertylevel expenses increased 23 million or 41 due mainly to increases in property taxes and expenses related to hotels leased from hpt as well as the inclusion of expenses from recently acquired hotels the increase in other propertylevel expenses for 2011 was driven mainly by the inclusion of expenses related to hotels leased from hpt  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased 113 million or 177 to 751 million in 2012 which includes a 60 million noncash impairment charge related to the westin mission hills resort amp spa the changes in 2012 and 2011 also reflect the inclusion of depreciation expense for newly acquired properties and recent capital expenditures  other income and expense  corporate and other expenses corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and bonuses and other costs such as employee stockbased compensation expense travel corporate insurance legal fees acquisitionrelated costs audit fees building rent and systems costs corporate expenses decreased approximately 4 million in 2012 corporate expenses in 2011 include a charge of 15 million related to the forfeited deposit for the grand hyatt washington transaction during 2012 this was partially offset by increases in acquisition and compensation expenses  corporate expenses increased approximately 3 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the 15 million loss described above and the accrual of 5 million of additional litigation costs which largely was offset by a decline in employee stock compensation the stockbased compensation is based on employee performance as well as host incs stockholder return relative to other reits and to other lodging companies and will vary significantly due to fluctuations in host incs stock price  gain on insurance settlements we recorded gains of 9 million and 2 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively related to the receipt of business interruption insurance proceeds for two properties in christchurch new zealand both of which were affected by an earthquake in february 2011 and one of which remains closed in 2012 we also recorded a gain of 2 million related to property insurance for two hotels in chile both of which were affected by an earthquake in february 2010 for further information on our insurance settlements see note 13 to our consolidated financial settlements  gain on insurance settlements  interest expense interest expense increased 2 million in 2012 the increase is due primarily to an increase in costs associated with debt extinguishments including prepayment premiums the acceleration of deferred financing    58    table of contents  costs and incremental interest totaling 35 million in 2012 compared to 10 million in 2011 after adjusting for debt extinguishment costs interest expense declined 23 million in 2012 reflecting the lower weighted average interest rate and overall debt balance in addition savings from our fixedtofloating interest rate swap reduced interest expense by 6 million for each of 2012 2011 and 2010  the decrease in interest expense during 2011 is due primarily to a decrease in costs associated with debt extinguishments including prepayment premiums the acceleration of deferred financing costs and incremental interest which totaled 10 million in 2011 compared to 26 million in 2010 after adjusting for debt extinguishment costs interest expense was comparable to 2010 levels  interest income interest income in 2012 and 2011 primarily represents amounts earned on our mortgage loan investment associated with the portfolio of five hotels acquired by the euro jv interest income related to the mortgage was 20 million 17 million and 4 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively due to the maturity of the mortgage loan in 2012 we expect interest income to significantly decline in 2013  net gains on property transactions and other net gains on property transactions and other increased in 2012 due to the 8 million gain related to the sale of land to the maui jv compared to a 2 million gain recorded in 2011 for the transfer of the le méridien piccadilly to the euro jv  benefit provision for income taxes we lease substantially all of our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as trs for federal income tax purposes the difference between hotellevel operating cash flow and the aggregate rent paid to host lp by the trs represents taxable income or loss on which we record an income tax provision or benefit the increase in the tax provision in each of 2012 and 2011 reflects yearoveryear improvements in property operations recognized by our trs as well as increases in foreign taxes in 2012  discontinued operations discontinued operations consist of three hotels disposed of in 2012 one hotel disposed of in 2011 and two hotels disposed of in 2010 and represent the results of operations and the gains or losses on the

resources  liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp the liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp are derived primarily from the activities of host lp which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations the incurrence of debt and the issuance of op units host incs only material asset is the ownership of partnership interests of host lp therefore its financing and investing activities are conducted through host lp except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock proceeds from stock issuances by host inc are contributed to host lp in exchange for op units additionally funds used by host inc to pay dividends or to repurchase stock are provided by host lp therefore while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between host inc and host lp we have not included a separate discussion of the liquidity and capital resources as the discussion applies to both host inc and host lp  overview we look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash debt and equity in order to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry as operations have improved we have maintained our focus on strategically decreasing our debttoequity ratio through i acquisitions and other investments the majority of which were completed with available cash and proceeds from equity issuances and ii the repayment and refinancing of senior notes and mortgage debt to extend maturity dates and lower interest rates    59    table of contents we have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt we have access to multiple types of financing as over 80 of our debt consists of senior notes exchangeable debentures and borrowings under our credit facility all of which are not collateralized by specific hotel properties during 2012 we took advantage of lower interest rates to issue new debt and used the proceeds to repay nearterm maturities resulting in the issuance of approximately 15 billion of debt that was used to fund the repayment or redemption of approximately 18 billion of senior notes and exchangeable debentures and 113 million of mortgage debt as of december 31 2012 our weighted average interest rate was 54 with a weighted average maturity of 51 years with our nearterm maturities representing approximately 5 of our total debt 277 million of mortgage debt additionally only 14 of our consolidated hotels were encumbered by mortgage debt  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our portfolio withstand declines in operating cash flow pay nearterm debt maturities and fund our capital expenditures programs as of december 31 2012 we have approximately 417 million of cash and cash equivalents and 737 million of available capacity under

our debt maturities consist of a 246 million mortgage on the orlando world center marriott and a 31 million mortgage on the westin denver downtown the mortgage on the westin denver downtown is due in 2023 however we intend to repay the loan in december 2013 without penalty as the related interest expense and principal amortization are scheduled to significantly increase at that time we also have

financial condition    60    table of contents capital resources we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth including acquisitions as a result the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure our financial flexibility including our ability to incur debt make distributions and make investments is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants which include among other things the allowable amounts of leverage interest coverage and fixed charges during 2011 and 2012 we decreased our nearterm debt maturities expanded our borrowing capacity under our senior revolving credit facility and maintained compliance with our senior note and credit facility covenants  on april 24 2012 host inc entered into sales agency financing agreements with bny mellon capital markets llc and scotia capital usa inc through which host inc may issue and sell from time to time shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 400 million the agreements followed the completion of 400 million of sales under a similar agreement

conditions are favorable after taking into account our liquidity requirements we may seek to issue and sell shares of host inc common stock in registered public offerings including through sales directly on the new york stock exchange under our existing or a future at the market offering program or to issue and sell shares of host inc preferred stock we also may seek to cause host lp to issue debentures exchangeable for shares of host inc common stock or senior notes given our total debt level and maturity schedule we will continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time taking advantage of favorable market conditions in february of 2013 host incs board of directors authorized repurchases up to 500 million of senior notes exchangeable debentures and mortgage debt other than in accordance with its terms separately the board of directors authorized redemptions and repurchases of all or a portion of 175 million principal amount of our 3 14 exchangeable debentures any redemption of the 3 14 exchangeable debentures will not reduce the 500 million of board authority noted above to repurchase other debt securities we may purchase senior notes and exchangeable debentures for cash through open market purchases privately negotiated transactions a tender offer or in some cases through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and ffo per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs accordingly in light of our

be considering or be in discussions with respect to the purchase or sale of common stock exchangeable debentures andor senior notes any such transactions may subject to applicable securities laws

investment and disposition activity detailed in the charts below we spent approximately 638 million on capital expenditures an increase of 96 million from 2011 our renewal and replacement capital expenditures for 2012 were approximately 366 million which reflects an increase of approximately 12 from 2011 levels our renewal and replacement capital expenditures generally are funded by the

years  senior notes the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issued by host lp which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semiannually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above under the terms of our senior notes indenture our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of host lps unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host lp  pledges and guarantees under the senior notes indenture all host lp subsidiaries which guarantee host lp debt similarly are required to guarantee debt issuances under the indenture also to the extent the equity of any subsidiaries of host lp are pledged to secure borrowings under the credit facility such collateral likewise is required to secure senior note issuances under the senior notes indenture while the credit facility currently does not include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests such guarantees or pledges subsequently will be required in the event that host lps leverage ratio exceeds 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility as well as the senior notes issued under the senior notes indenture and certain hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility if triggered the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain us and canadian subsidiaries of host lp and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would not provide guarantees or pledges of equity interests further if at any time our leverage ratio falls below 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters or host lp has an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating such guarantees and pledges may be released  restrictive covenants under the terms of the senior notes indenture should our senior notes fall below their current investment grade rating our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions will be subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions including the achievement of an ebitdatointerest coverage ratio of at least 20x this ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they occurred at the beginning of the period under the terms of our senior notes indenture interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan to establish its fair value and approximately 17 million of noncash interest expense recorded in 2012 related to our exchangeable debentures all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations our subsidiaries are subject to the restrictive covenants in the indenture however in certain circumstances we are permitted to designate certain subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries these unrestricted subsidiaries are not subject to the restrictive covenants unless they are guarantors and may engage in transactions to dispose of or encumber their assets or otherwise incur additional indebtedness without complying with the restrictive covenants in the indenture if we were to designate additional subsidiaries as unrestricted    67    table of contents  subsidiaries neither the ebitda generated by nor the interest expense allocated to these entities would be included in our ratio calculations other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness host incs ability to pay dividends and host lps ability to make distributions should our senior notes fall below their current investment grade rating include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65 of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values excluding intangible assets and maintaining secured indebtedness and subsidiary indebtedness of less than 45 of adjusted total assets so long as our senior notes maintain their current investment grade rating or we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture we may make preferred or common op unit distributions and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition in addition even if our senior notes are not rated investment grade and we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and make distributions we still are permitted to incur certain types of debt including i credit facility debt ii refinancing debt iii up to 400 million of mortgage debt whose proceeds would be used to repay debt under credit facility and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount and iv up to 150 million of other debt we also are permitted to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain host incs reit status  our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters such as host lps ability to make distributions on redeem or repurchase its op units make investments permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries sell assets guarantee indebtedness enter into transactions with affiliates create certain liens and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies compliance with certain of these covenants is suspended while our senior notes maintain an investment grade rating in addition should our senior notes fall below an investment grade rating our senior notes indenture also imposes a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets defined in the indenture as undepreciated property book value of not less than 125 of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other debt not secured by mortgages this coverage requirement is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or make distributions discussed above whose consequences where we fall below the coverage level are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or make distributions but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture  as of december 31 2012 when our senior notes did not have an investment grade rating we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the senior notes indenture the

equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes holders have the right to require us to purchase the debentures at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest the put option on certain dates subsequent to their respective issuances holders of the debentures also have the right to exchange the debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions including at any time at which the closing price of host incs common stock is more than 120 for the 2004 debentures or 130 for the 2009 debentures of the exchange price per share for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during certain periods or at any time up to two days prior to the date on which the debentures have been called for redemption we can redeem for cash all or part of any of the debentures at any time subsequent to each of their respective redemption dates at a redemption price of 100 of the principal amount plus accrued interest if at any time we elect to redeem the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price we would expect the holders to elect to exchange the debentures at the respective exchange value rather than receive the cash redemption price the    68    table of contents  exchange value is equal to the applicable exchange rate multiplied by the price of host incs common stock upon exchange the 2004 debentures would be

unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 175x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 125x the financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility hence so long as there are no amounts outstanding thereunder and the term loan is repaid we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose

of contents  redemption by the holders thereof for cash or at the election of host inc host inc common stock based on the then current conversion ratio the current conversion ratio was adjusted from 10 to 1021494 shares of host inc common stock for each op unit as a result of host incs special dividend in 2009 90 of which was paid in shares of host inc common stock this adjustment was made to avoid any unintended dilution as a result of the portion of host incs 2009 special dividend paid in common stock to its stockholders  investors should take into account the 14 noncontrolling position of host lp op units when analyzing dividend payments by host inc to its stockholders as these holders of op units share on a pro rata basis in amounts being distributed by host lp to holders of its corresponding op units for example if host inc paid a 1 per share dividend on its common stock it would be based on the payment of a 1021494 per common unit distribution by host lp to host inc as well as to other common op unitholders  during 2012 host incs board of directors declared dividends of 030 per share beginning in the first quarter at 006 per share and increasing by 001 per share each

the euro jv has 1031 million of mortgage debt including debt incurred in its recent acquisitions all of which is nonrecourse to us a default of the euro jv mortgage debt does not trigger a default under any of our debt the operating performance of the portfolio of six properties located in spain italy poland and the united kingdom that secures 338 million of mortgage loans due in 2013 is below levels required by certain debt covenants which performance has triggered covenant defaults and cash sweeps under the loans these loans are crosscollateralized meaning that a default under one loan could trigger a default on the loans for the other five properties the lenders have granted the euro jv a waiver with respect to the defaults through the april 2013 maturity date and currently are discussing the terms of a multiyear extension of the maturity of this debt we expect that lenders may require more stringent financial covenants higher loan spreads over libor and lower loantovalue ratios these requirements upon any refinancing or a debt extension transaction likely will require a partial principal reduction via an equity contribution from the partners of euro jv fund i including host that will exceed the remaining commitment of euro jv fund i partners no assurances can be made that we will be successful in refinancing this debt or that the partners will agree to increase their commitment based on our ownership interest in the euro jv our portion of the loans is 108 million a covenant default also was triggered under a mortgage loan secured by three properties

affiliated with us for example a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us this adjustment could produce a tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement additionally under the partnership agreement between host inc and host lp host lp is obligated to pay certain taxes federal state local and foreign including any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc as well as any liabilities the irs may successfully assert against host inc we do not expect any amounts paid under these tax sharing arrangements to be material  tax indemnification agreements as a result of certain federal and state income tax considerations of the former owners of two hotels currently owned by host lp we have agreed to restrictions on selling such hotels or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods one of these agreements expires in 2028 and the other in 2031  guarantees we have certain guarantees which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt that are not recorded on our books due to various dispositions spinoffs and contractual arrangements but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote the largest guarantees by dollar amount are listed below            we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested nonlodging properties these primarily represent certain restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately 21 million as of december 31 2012            in 1997 we owned leisure park venture limited partnership which currently owns and operates a senior living facility we no longer have an ownership interest in the partnership but remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with respect to 147 million of municipal bonds issued by the new jersey economic development authority through their maturity in 2027 however to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee we have been indemnified by barceló crestline corporation who in turn is indemnified by the current owner of the facility    75    table of contents         in connection with the sale of two hotels in january 2005 we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases the future minimum lease payments are approximately 12 million through the full term of the leases including renewal options we believe that the likelihood of any liability arising related to these ground leases is remote and in each case we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel            in connection with the sale of the atlanta marriott marquis in january 2013 we retained 5 million of contingent liabilities related to potential environmental liabilities  information on other guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements may be found in note 16 to our consolidated financial

included in this category based on the weighted average interest rate    2 our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels under our contracts we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years    3 the amounts shown include deferred management fees and the estimated amount of tax expense under terms of our management agreements we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owners priority to us the timing of the payments if any is based on future operations the termination of the management agreement or the sale of the hotel and is therefore not determinable the estimated amount of tax expense relates to uncertain tax liabilities from prior years  critical accounting policies  our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates we evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to the impairment of longlived assets on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates  hotels acquired in a business combination we record our investments in hotel properties based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition date property and equipment are recorded at fair value and allocated to buildings improvements furniture fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties fair values are based on the exit price ie the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we evaluate several factors including market data for similar assets expected cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair value of our assets    76    table of contents other items that we evaluate in a business combination include identifiable intangible assets capital lease assets and obligations and goodwill identifiable intangible assets are typically assumed contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements which are recorded at fair value abovemarket and belowmarket contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the contract intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the remaining noncancelable term of the related agreements capital lease obligations that are assumed as part of the acquisition of a leasehold interest are measured at fair value and included as debt on the accompanying balance sheet and we record the corresponding righttouse assets classification of a lease does not change if it is part of a business combination in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data including thirdparty appraisals and valuations in certain situations a deferred tax liability may be created due to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the asset at the acquisition date any consideration paid in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired would be recorded to goodwill in very limited circumstances we may record a bargain purchase gain if the consideration paid is less than the net fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired furthermore acquisitionrelated costs such as due diligence legal and accounting fees are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets  impairment testing we analyze our assets for impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying values thereof may not be recoverable we consider a property to be impaired when the sum of future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset for impaired assets we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the propertys carrying value over its fair value to the extent that a property has a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that it is more likely than not the property will be disposed of prior to the end of its useful life it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the propertys carrying value in the absence of other factors we assume that the estimated life is equal to the gaap depreciable life because of the continuous property maintenance and improvement capital expenditures required under our management agreements we adjust our assumptions with respect to the remaining useful life of the property if situations dictate otherwise such as an expiring ground lease or it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold prior to its previously expected useful life we also consider the effect of regular renewal and replacement capital expenditures on the estimable life of our properties including critical infrastructure which is regularly maintained and then replaced at the end of its useful life  we test for impairment in several situations including when a property has a current or projected loss from operations when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when other events trends contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in the evaluation of the impairment of our assets we make many assumptions and estimates including            projected cash flows both from operations and the eventual disposition            expected useful life and holding period            future required capital expenditures and            fair values including consideration of capitalization rates discount rates and comparable selling prices  while we consider all of the above indicators as a preliminary indicator to determine if the carrying value may not be recovered by undiscounted cash flows we reviewed the actual yeartodate and the projected cash flows from operations to identify properties with actual or projected annual operating losses or minimal operating profit as of december 31 2012 the projected cash flows consider items such as booking pace occupancy room rate and propertylevel operating costs as a result of our review we identified five properties that required further consideration of property and market specific conditions or factors to determine if the property was impaired using an undiscounted cash flow analysis management considered a range of revpar and operating margins compared to prior years operating results in evaluating the probabilityweighted projected cash flows from operations to appropriately evaluate if the carrying value of the assets was recoverable we projected cash flows such that the    77    table of contents  individual properties would return to normalized levels of operations generally within five years and thereafter grow at a stabilized rate of approximately 3 over the remaining estimable lives of the properties this stabilized growth rate is lower than the projected growth rate for the urban upper upscale properties which we believe is most representative of our portfolio over the period from 2012 through 2022 based on this test one property exhibited an impaired value at december 31 2012 for purposes of this test if we had assumed a growth rate of 50 basis points lower after the return to normalized levels of operations none of the other four properties identified above would have required further analysis management believes its assumptions and estimates reflect current market conditions we recognized impairment expense in the aggregate amount of 60 million and 8 million for 2012 and 2011 respectively based on a change in their estimated hold periods  otherthantemporary impairment of an investment we review our equity method investments for otherthantemporary impairment based on the occurrence of any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an otherthantemporary basis triggering events can include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment a change in the expected hold period or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel properties therefore we generally will have few observable inputs and will determine the fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment as well as considering the impact of other elements ie control premiums etc we use certain inputs such as available thirdparty appraisals and forecast net operating income for the hotel properties to estimate the expected cash flows if an equity method investment is impaired a loss is recorded for the difference between its fair value and its carrying value based on this test no otherthantemporary impairment was recorded in 2012  classification of assets as held for sale our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale of the asset is probable prior to classifying it as such will be completed within one year and that actions required to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that it is unlikely the planned sale will not occur this policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner specifically we typically will classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met            host incs board of directors has approved the sale to the extent that the dollar amount of the sale requires board approval            a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed            the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and            no significant contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner  to the extent that a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property we will record an impairment loss  depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets as well as specific market and economic conditions while management believes its estimates are reasonable a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels  valuation of deferred tax assets we have approximately 90 million net of a valuation allowance of 63 million of deferred tax assets as of december 31 2012 the objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a companys financial statements or tax returns we have considered various factors including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation    78    table of contents  allowance for our deferred tax assets and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the 90 million of net deferred tax assets in the future when a determination is made that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period  valuation of derivative contracts we occasionally will enter into derivative products including interest rate and foreign currency swaps caps and collars derivative instruments are subject to fair value reporting at each reporting date and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income loss or accumulated other comprehensive income loss based on the applicable hedge accounting guidance we estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use of third party valuations which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted future expected cash payments we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings thresholds mutual puts and guarantees the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves the values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations the fair value of our derivatives is likely to fluctuate from yeartoyear based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity  stock compensation we recognize costs resulting from host incs sharebased payment transactions over their vesting periods we classify sharebased payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity awards or liability awards the classification of host incs restricted stock awards as either an equity award or a liability award is based upon cash settlement options equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period awards are classified as liability awards to the extent that settlement features allow the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax withholding requirements the value of these restricted stock awards less estimated forfeitures is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  the requisite service period usually the vesting period no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite services  on january 20 2012 the compensation policy committee of the board of directors adopted a new compensation plan for senior management the 2012 plan that replaces the expired 2009 compensation program components of the 2012 plan include the following awards            restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions these awards vest based on the total shareholder return tsr relative to i the nareit index ii the sampp index and iii a selected lodging company index that serves as a relevant industryasset specific measurement to our competitors us based senior management may elect to have amounts withheld for taxes in excess of minimum statutory tax requirements and as result tsr awards granted to these employees are classified as liability awards and are remeasured to fair value each reporting period in contrast senior management located outside of the us are limited as to the amount of shares they may use for statutory tax requirements and as result tsr awards granted to these employees are classified as equity awards and are recorded at fair value as of the grant date the valuation of these awards is a custom calculation that is based on common valuation techniques such as the lattice binomial and blackscholes valuation methodologies the utilization of this model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of host incs common stock riskfree interest rates actual tsr from the beginning of the performance period through the measurement date host incs stock beta as compared to the risk to the average risk of the peer groups            restricted stock awards with vesting based on performance conditions these awards are earned based on the employee achieving a specified performance target which will be based on the employees specific management business objectives compensation cost will be recognized when the achievement of the performance condition is considered probable if a performance condition has more than one outcome that is probable recognition of compensation cost will be based on the condition that is the most likely outcome for us based senior management these awards are classified as liability awards due to their cash settlement provisions therefore the value of the shares to be issued by host inc will be based on host incs share price on the reporting date            stock option awards the stock option awards are equity classified awards as they do not include cash settlement features therefore the value of the award is determined on the grant date using a binomial pricing model and is not adjusted for future changes in fair value vesting for these awards is based on service conditions the utilization of the binomial model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock riskfree interest rates and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited and our expected dividend yield    79    table of contents on january 20 2012 host inc granted senior management 16 million restricted shares for performance year 2012 which represent the maximum number of shares that can be earned during the year if performance is at the high level of achievement vesting of these shares is subject to meeting the performance measures outlined above approximately 50 of the restricted shares granted are marketbased with the remaining performancebased in addition the company awarded approximately 02 million stock options with an exercise price of 1623 per share for performance year 2012 during 2012 we recorded approximately 16 million of stock compensation expense associated with the 2012 grant  consolidation policies judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in terms of the evaluation of control including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests we consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the subsidiary for the majority of our hotel and real estate investments we consider those rights to be i approval or amendment of developments plans ii financing decisions iii approval or amendments of operating budgets and iv investment strategy decisions for those partnerships and joint ventures of which we are the general partner we review the rights of the limited partners to determine if those rights would preclude the presumption of control as the general partner limited partner rights which would preclude presumption of control by the general partner include the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the limited partnership or otherwise remove us as the general partner without cause and substantive participating rights primarily through voting rights  we also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they should be considered variable interest entities vies if a subsidiary is a vie it is subject to the consolidation framework specifically for vies we consider an entity a vie if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support we review our subsidiaries and affiliates annually to determine if i they should be considered vies and ii whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in their characteristics  foreign currency translation the operations of international subsidiaries are maintained in their functional currency which generally is the local currency and are translated to us dollars using the average exchange rates for the period the assets and liabilities are translated to us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency of each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at period end exchange rates the resulting exchange differences are recorded in gain loss on foreign currency transactions and derivatives except when deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as qualifying net investment hedges  comparable hotel operating statistics  to facilitate a yeartoyear comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics ie revpar average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues expenses adjusted operating profit and associated margins for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis because these statistics and operating results are for our hotel properties they exclude results for our nonhotel properties and other real estate investments we define our comparable hotels as properties        i that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and        ii that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone largescale capital projects as further defined below during the reporting periods being compared    80    table of contents the hotel business is capitalintensive and renovations are a regular part of the business generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels a large scale capital project that would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set is an extensive renovation of several core aspects of the hotel such as rooms meeting space lobby bars restaurants and other public spaces both quantitative and qualitative factors are taken into consideration in determining if the renovation would cause a hotel to be removed from the comparable hotel set including unusual or exceptional circumstances such as a reduction or increase in room count rebranding a significant alteration of the business operations or the closing of the hotel during the renovation  we do not include an acquired hotel in our comparable hotel set until the operating results for that hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year for example we acquired the westin chicago river north in august of 2010 the hotel was not included in our comparable hotels until january 1 2012 hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption or commence a largescale capital project in each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after completion of the repair of the property damage or cessation of the business interruption or the completion of largescale capital projects as applicable  of the 119 hotels we owned on december 31 2012 103 have been classified as comparable hotels the operating results of the following hotels that we owned or leased as of december 31 2012 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods            grand hyatt washington acquired in july 2012            hilton melbourne south wharf acquired in april 2011            the westin new york grand central acquired in march 2011            manchester grand hyatt san diego acquired in march 2011            the portfolio of seven hotels in new zealand acquired in february 2011            orlando world center marriott business interruption due to a largescale capital project which includes façade restoration the shutdown of the main pool and a complete restoration and enhancement of the hotel including new water slides and activity areas new pool dining facilities and the renovation of one tower of guestrooms meeting space and restaurants            atlanta marriott perimeter center business interruption due to extensive renovations which included renovation of the guest rooms lobby bar and restaurant and the demolition of one tower of the hotel reducing the room count at the hotel            chicago marriott ohare business interruption due to extensive renovations which included renovating every aspect of the hotel and shutting down over 200 rooms            sheraton indianapolis hotel at keystone crossing business interruption due to extensive renovations which included the conversion of one tower of the hotel into apartments reducing the room count and the renovation of the remaining guest rooms lobby bar and meeting space and            san diego marriott marquis amp marina business interruption due to extensive renovations which included the renovation of every aspect of the hotel and required the entire hotel to be closed for a period of time  the operating results of the le méridien piccadilly which was transferred to the euro jv fund ii in 2011 and of the four hotels we disposed of in 2012 and 2011 as well as the 53 courtyard by marriott properties previously leased from hpt are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein    81    table of contents we evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both geographic region and property type these divisions are generally consistent with groupings recognized in the lodging industry  geographic regions consist of the following only states in which we own hotels are listed            pacific  california hawaii oregon and washington            mountain  arizona and colorado            north central  illinois indiana minnesota missouri and ohio            south central

 resortconference  hotels located in resortconference destinations such as arizona florida hawaii and southern california and            airport  hotels located at or near airports  reporting periods effective january 1 2013 marriott announced that it will convert from a 5253 week fiscal year to a 12month calendar year while our annual financial statements have always been reported on a calendar basis and are unaffected by this change our quarterly results have not been on a 3month calendar quarter basis as they followed marriotts period schedule however beginning with the first quarter of 2013 we will report annual and quarterly operating results on a calendar reporting cycle which is consistent with the majority of companies in the lodging industry we will not restate any previously reported quarterly financial statements to conform to the new presentation accordingly investors may find the following discussion useful when evaluating quarterly operations in 2013 with prior year quarterly results for both financial statement presentation and hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results  for consolidated statement of operations the results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers our hotel managers use different reporting periods marriott international inc the manager of a significant percentage of our properties prior to january 1 2013 used a fiscal year ending on the friday closest to december 31 and reported twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its us and canadian marriottmanaged hotels in contrast other managers of our hotels such as hyatt and starwood report results on a monthly basis host inc as a reit is required by federal income tax law to report results on a calendar year basis as a result we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by marriott modified so that our fiscal year always ends on december 31 in order to comply with reit rules our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as marriott but our fourth quarter ends on december 31 and our full year results as reported in our statement of operations always includes the same number of days as the calendar year    82    table of contents two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted for periods prior to january 1 2013 are 1 quarterly start dates will usually differ between years except for the first quarter which always commences on january 1 and 2 our first and fourth quarters of operations and yeartodate operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years for example set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for 2012 and 2011 note that the second and third quarters of each year both reflect twelve weeks of operations in contrast the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations                     2012    2011       startend dates   no of days    startend dates   no of days   first quarter   january 1  march 23    83   january 1  march 25    84   second quarter   march 24  june 15    84   march 26  june 17    84   third quarter   june 16  september 7    84   june 18  september 9    84   fourth quarter   september 8  december 31   115   september 10  december 31   113  while the reporting calendar we adopted for periods prior to january 1 2013 is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by marriott another consequence of our calendar is that we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarterend until the following quarter because our hotel managers that use a monthly reporting period do not make midmonth results available to us hence the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarterend is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following quarter for those hotel managers covering approximately 48 of total revenues of our hotels as a result our quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows first quarter january february second quarter march to may third quarter june to august and fourth quarter september to december while this does not affect full year results it does affect the reporting of quarterly results for years prior to 2013  for hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results in contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statement of operations our 2011 and 2012 hotel operating statistics ie revpar average daily rate and average occupancy and our 2011 and 2012 comparable hotel results are reported based on the reporting cycle used by marriott in those years for our marriottmanaged hotels this facilitates yeartoyear comparisons as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year this means however that the reporting periods we used for hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results for 2012 and 2011 will differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly

performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap within the meaning of applicable sec rules these measures are as follows i ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp ii funds from operations ffo and ffo per diluted share both nareit and adjusted as a measure of performance for host inc and iii comparable hotel operating results as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp    83    table of contents we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the nareit definition of ffo or do not calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance in addition although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to nonreits we also calculate adjusted ffo per diluted share which is not in accordance with nareit guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other reits ebitda and adjusted ebitda as presented may also not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with gaap cash expenditures for various longterm assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures interest expense for ebitda and adjusted ebitda purposes only and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the ebitda adjusted ebitda nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share presentations management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our nongaap financial measures additionally nareit ffo per diluted share adjusted ffo per diluted share ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions in addition nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as a measure of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders benefit the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance  ebitda and adjusted ebitda  ebitda  earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries management believes ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization management also believes the use of ebitda facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits hotel owners who are not reits and other capitalintensive companies management uses ebitda to evaluate propertylevel results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs  adjusted ebitda  historically management has adjusted ebitda when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of adjusted ebitda when combined with the primary gaap presentation of net income is beneficial to an investors complete understanding of our operating performance adjusted ebitda is also a relevant measure in calculating certain credit ratios we adjust ebitda for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as adjusted ebitda            real estate transactions  we exclude the effect of gains and losses including the amortization of deferred gains recorded on the disposition or acquisition of depreciable assets and property insurance gains in our consolidated statement of operations because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets in addition material gains or losses from the depreciated value of the disposed assets could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset value often does not reflect its market value as noted below for ffo            equity investment adjustments  we exclude the equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated investments in partnerships and joint ventures as presented in our consolidated statement of operations because it includes our pro rata portion of depreciation amortization and interest expense which are    84    table of contents       excluded from ebitda we include our pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our equity investments as we believe this more accurately reflects the performance of our investments the pro rata adjusted ebitda of equity investments is defined as the ebitda of our equity investments adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by our percentage ownership in the partnership or joint venture            consolidated partnership adjustments  we deduct the noncontrolling partners pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our consolidated partnerships as this reflects the noncontrolling owners interest in the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships the pro rata adjusted ebitda of noncontrolling partners is defined as the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by the noncontrolling partners positions in the partnership or joint venture            cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  infrequently the financial accounting standards board fasb promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle we exclude these onetime adjustments because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period            impairment losses  we exclude the effect of impairment losses recorded because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets in addition we believe that impairment charges which are based off of historical cost account values are similar to gains losses on dispositions and depreciation expense both of which are also excluded from ebitda            acquisition costs  under gaap costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company  the following table provides a reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda in millions  reconciliation of net income loss to ebitda adjusted ebitda                    year ended

contents nareit ffo nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share we present nareit ffo and nareit ffo per diluted share as nongaap measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share as our nareit ffo defined as set forth below for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with nareit guidelines nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains losses from sales of real estate the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles real estaterelated depreciation amortization and impairments and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata ffo of those entities on the same basis  we believe that nareit ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of nareit ffo per diluted share when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairments and gains and losses from sales of real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other reits even though nareit ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as noted by nareit in its april 2002 white paper on funds from operations since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves for these reasons nareit adopted the ffo metric in order to promote an industrywide measure of reit operating performance  we also present adjusted ffo per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs we believe that the presentation of adjusted ffo per diluted share when combined with both the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share and ffo per diluted share as defined by nareit provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investors complete understanding of our operating performance we adjust nareit ffo per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as adjusted ffo per diluted share            gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired we also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock we believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs            acquisition costs  under gaap costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company            litigation gains and losses  we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business we

present operating results for hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions significant property damage or large scale capital improvements during these periods we present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporatelevel costs including expenses related to our capital structure as well as depreciation and amortization we eliminate corporatelevel costs and expenses to arrive at property level results because we believe propertylevel results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels we eliminate depreciation and amortization because even though depreciation and amortization are propertylevel expenses these noncash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves  as a result of the elimination of corporatelevel costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance  we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the periodtoperiod performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners in particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues andor expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of these

purpose of the interest rate swaps is to hedge against changes in cash flows interest payments attributable to fluctuations in benchmark interest rates associated with variable rate debt the derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement we also evaluate counterparty credit risk when we calculate the fair value of the swaps changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded to other comprehensive income loss on the accompanying balance sheets the hedges were fully effective as of december 31 2012 the following table summarizes our

entered into in connection with the 87 million mortgage loan on seven properties in new zealand  interest rate swap derivatives designated as fair value hedges we have designated our fixedtofloating interest rate swap derivatives as fair value hedges we enter into these derivative instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt that occur as a result of changes in market interest rates the derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement we also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps the change in the fair value of the derivative is offset largely by the corresponding change in the fair value of the underlying debt due to change in the 3month libor rate which is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt any difference between the change in the fair value of the swap and the change in the fair value in the underlying debt which was not significant for the periods presented is considered the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship and is recorded in net income loss  we have three fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount of 300 million during 2012 and 2011 the fair value of the swaps decreased 35 million and increased 03 million respectively as a result we will pay a floating interest rate equal to the 3month libor plus a spread which ranges from 27 to 32 as opposed to the fixed rate of 5531 on the notional amount of 300 million through march 1 2014 during each of 2012 and 2011 the cash settlement received under the swap agreement decreased interest expense by 6 million if we were to increase the interest rates from the prevailing market yield curve which for our reverse swaps is 3month libor by 25 at december 31 2012 then the fair value of the swap would decrease 03 million similarly if we were to decrease the interest rates from the prevailing market yield curve by 25 at december 31 2012 then the fair value of the swap would increase by 03 million  exchange rate sensitivity  we have currency exchange risk as a result of our hotel ownership in australia canada chile mexico brazil and

option foreign currency purchase contracts or designate a portion of the foreign currency draws on our credit facility as hedges of net investments in foreign operations the foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into were strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes  as of december 31 2012 we have six foreign currency forward sale contracts that hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in foreign operations these derivatives are considered hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation and are markedtomarket with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss within the equity portion of our balance sheets the

financial statements include the consolidated accounts of host inc host lp and their subsidiaries and controlled affiliates including joint ventures and partnerships we consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity for those partnerships and joint ventures where we are the general partner we review the rights of the limited partners to determine if those rights would overcome the presumption of control as the general partner limited partner rights which would overcome presumption of control by the general partner include the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause and substantive participating rights over activities considered most significant to the business of the partnership or joint venture primarily voting rights  we also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they are variable interest entities vies typically the entity that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance would consolidate the vie we consider an entity a vie if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support we review our subsidiaries at least annually to determine if i they should be considered vies and ii whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in the characteristics of these entities  use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates  cash and cash equivalents  we consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents  restricted cash  restricted cash includes reserves for debt service real estate taxes insurance furniture fixtures and equipment replacement as well as cash collateral and excess cash flow deposits due to mortgage debt agreement restrictions and provisions and a reserve required for potential legal damages for purposes of the statements of cash flows changes in restricted cash caused by changes in required legal reserves are shown as operating activities changes in restricted cash caused by using such funds for furniture fixtures and equipment replacement are shown as investing activities the remaining changes in restricted cash are the direct result of restrictions under our loan agreements and are reflected in cash flows from financing activities  property and equipment  generally property and equipment is recorded at cost for properties we develop cost includes interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction for property and equipment acquired in a business combination we record the assets based on their fair value as of the acquisition date replacements and improvements and capital leases are capitalized while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred we depreciate our property and equipment using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets  we capitalize certain inventory such as china glass silver linen at the time of a hotel opening or acquisition or when significant inventory is purchased in conjunction with a major rooms renovation or when the number of rooms or meeting space at a hotel is expanded these amounts are then amortized over the estimated useful life of three years subsequent replacement purchases are expensed when placed in service    113    table of contents host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued    we maintain a furniture fixtures and equipment replacement fund for renewal and replacement capital expenditures at certain hotels which generally is funded with 5 of property revenues  we analyze our consolidated properties for impairment when events or circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we consider a property to be impaired when the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset we test for impairment in several situations including when a property has a current or projected loss from operations when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when other events trends contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable for impaired assets we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value in the evaluation of the impairment of our assets we make many assumptions and estimates including assumptions of the projected cash flows both from operations and the eventual disposition the expected useful life and holding period of the asset the future required capital expenditures and fair values including consideration of capitalization rates discount rates and comparable selling prices as well as available thirdparty appraisals during 2012 and 2011 we recognized impairment charges of 60 million on one property which is included in depreciation and amortization and 8 million on two properties which is included in discontinued operations respectively based on changes in estimated hold periods  we perform a similar analysis for our equity method investments for impairment based on the occurrence of triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an otherthantemporary basis triggering events can include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment a change in the expected useful life or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel properties therefore we generally will have few observable inputs and will determine fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment as well as consideration of the impact of other elements ie control premiums etc if an equity method investment is impaired and that impairment is determined to be other than temporary a loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment  we will classify a hotel as held for sale when the sale of the asset is probable will be completed within one year and actions to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that the sale will not occur we typically classify assets as held for sale when host incs board of directors has approved the sale a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed under which the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and no significant financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner if these criteria are met we will cease recording depreciation and will record an impairment loss if the fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount of the hotel we will classify the loss together with the related operating results including interest expense on debt assumed by the buyer or that is required to be repaid as a result of the sale as discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of operations and classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the balance sheet gains on sales of properties are recognized at the time of sale or deferred and recognized as income in subsequent periods as conditions requiring deferral are satisfied or expire without further cost to us  we recognize the fair value of any liability for conditional asset retirement obligations including environmental remediation liabilities when incurred which generally is upon acquisition construction or development andor through the normal operation of the asset if sufficient information exists with which to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation  intangible assets  in conjunction with our acquisitions we may identify intangible assets identifiable intangible assets typically include contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements which are recorded at fair value these contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the contract intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the remaining noncancelable term of the related agreements    114    table of contents host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries  notes

redeemable at the end of but not prior to the finite life at december 31 2012 and 2011 the fair values of the noncontrolling interests in the partnerships with finite lives were approximately 65

attributable to noncontrolling interests of third parties is 1 million 1 million and 04 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively  host incs treatment of the noncontrolling interests of host lp host inc adjusts the noncontrolling interests of host lp each period so that the amount presented equals the greater of its carrying value based on the historical cost or its redemption value the historical cost is based on the proportional relationship between the historical cost of equity held by our common stockholders relative to that of the unitholders of host lp the redemption value is based on the amount of cash or host inc stock at our option that would be paid to the noncontrolling interests of host lp if it were terminated we have assumed that the redemption value is equivalent to the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the outside op units one op unit may be exchanged for 1021494 shares of host inc common stock valued at the market price of host inc common stock at the balance sheet date noncontrolling interests of host lp are classified in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet as they do not meet the requirements for

million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively  distributions from investments in affiliates  we classify the distributions from our equity investments in the statements of cash flows based upon an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances of each distribution for example distributions from cash generated by property operations are classified as cash flows from operating activities

the euro jv mortgage debt does not trigger a default under any of our debt the operating performance of a portfolio of six properties located in spain italy poland and the united kingdom that secures 338 million of mortgage loans due in 2013 is below levels required by certain debt covenants which have triggered covenant defaults and cash sweeps under the loans these loans are crosscollateralized meaning that a default under one loan could trigger a default on the loans for the other five properties the lenders have granted the euro jv a waiver of the defaults and are currently discussing the terms of a multiyear extension of the maturity of this debt we expect that lenders will require more stringent financial covenants interest rates with higher basis point spreads over libor and lower loantovalue ratios these requirements upon a refinancing or a debt extension transaction likely will require a partial principal reduction via an equity contribution from the partners of the euro jv including host that will exceed the remaining commitment of the euro jv fund i partners no assurances can be made that we will be successful in refinancing this debt or that the partners will agree to increase their commitment based on our ownership interest in the euro jv our portion of the loans is 108 million a covenant default was also triggered under a mortgage loan secured by three properties

of barceló crestline corporation barceló for these properties and barceló guaranteed rent payments to hpt as part of the sublease in june 2010 hpt sent notices of default because the subtenants failed to meet certain net worth covenants which failure would have triggered an event of default by us under the leases between us and hpt as a result we terminated the subleases effective july 6 2010 and resumed acting as owner under the management agreements effective upon termination of the subleases we recorded the operations of the hotels as opposed to rental income on december 30 2011 we entered

fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market assumptions based on market data observable inputs and a reporting entitys own assumptions about market data unobservable inputs the requirements are intended to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and related disclosures fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date in an orderly transaction an exit price assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy the three levels are as follows  level 1  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date an active market is defined as a market in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing on an ongoing basis  level 2  inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active markets with few transactions inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability ie interest rates yield curves etc and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data correlation or other means  level 3  unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the pricing of an asset or liability when observable inputs are not available    140    table of contents host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries

related to the westin mission hills resort amp spa we evaluated the recoverability of the hotels carrying value assuming that it was more likely than not that the hotel will be sold before the end of its estimated useful life using an estimated undiscounted net cash flow we concluded that the carrying value of the hotel was not fully recoverable we estimated the fair value of the hotel using a discounted cash flow analysis with an estimated stabilized growth rate of 3 a discounted cash flow term of 10 years a capitalization rate of 11 and a discount rate of 12 the discount and capitalization rates used for the fair value of the property reflect its heightened risk profile and are not indicative of our portfolio as a whole    141    table of contents host hotels amp resorts

swap derivatives designated as fair value hedges we have designated our fixedtofloating interest rate swap derivatives as fair value hedges we enter into these derivative instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt that occur as a result of changes in market interest rates the derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement we also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are largely offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the underlying debt due to changes in the 3month libor rate which change is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt any difference between the change in the fair value of the swap and the change in the fair value in the underlying debt which was not significant for the periods presented is considered the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship and is recognized in net income loss  we have three fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount totaling 300 million during 2012 and 2011 the fair value of the swaps decreased 35 million and increased 03 million respectively as a result we will pay a floating interest rate equal to the 3month libor plus a spread which ranges from 27 to 32 as opposed to the fixed rate of 5531 on the

to the hotel novotel christchurch cathedral square and the hotel ibis christchurch the ibis reopened in september 2012 and the novotel is expected to reopen mid2013 however the historic portion of the novotel the warners building has been demolished and is not expected to be replaced we believe we have sufficient coverage under the insurance policy of our property manager for both property and business interruption we have recorded a loss of 3 million which represents the estimated deductible under our insurance policy in the second quarter of 2011  we estimated that we incurred approximately 33 million of property damage which amount represents the book value of the properties and equipment written off less any deductible and the related repairs and cleanup costs incurred gains on property insurance proceeds represent proceeds received in excess of the insurance receivable which receivable represents the book value of the damaged assets that were writtenoff any gains resulting from insurance proceeds are not recognized until all contingencies are resolved during 2012 and 2011 we recognized a gain of 9 million and 2 million respectively for the receipt of business interruption insurance proceeds as of december 31 2012 we have agreed upon settlement amounts with our primary insurer for all property and business interruption insurance except for real property damage to the warners building while the primary insurer has recognized its liability with regard to the warners building there is no agreed settlement amounts for real property damage to the warners building as the ground lessor has filed suit to recover a portion of the insurance proceeds from the primary insurer for the hotel while we can provide no assurance as to the timing of when this dispute will be settled we believe that it is more likely than not that we will recover the full value of our insurance receivable in addition we have made a separate claim for reimbursement under our corporate policy though we have not recorded any additional amounts of insurance receivable with regard to this claim we have received 21 million of cash for property insurance and have an outstanding insurance receivable of 11 million which is included in other assets representing the remaining claims for property damage    144    table of contents host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp

pursuant to management or operating agreements with some of those hotels also being subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operation under the designated brand the hotel brands of three of our managers marriott starwood and hyatt represent 60 23 and 11 of our total revenues respectively under these agreements the managers generally have sole responsibility for all activities necessary for the daytoday operation of the hotels including establishing room rates processing reservations and promoting and publicizing the hotels the managers also provide all employees for the hotels prepare reports budgets and projections and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels for the majority of our properties we have approval rights over budgets capital expenditures significant leases and contractual commitments and various other matters  the initial term of our agreements generally is 15 to 25 years with one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager the majority of our agreements condition the managers right to exercise options for renewal upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria the manager typically receives a base management fee which is calculated as a percentage generally 23 of annual gross revenues and an incentive management fee which typically is calculated as a percentage generally 1020 of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the base management fee is only 1 of annual gross revenues but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable to starwood under a separate license agreement pertaining to the designated brand including rights to use trademarks service marks and logos matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services under the license agreement starwood generally receives 5 of gross revenues attributable to room sales and 2 of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales in addition to a base management fee  as part of the agreements the manager furnishes the hotels with certain chain services which are generally provided on a central or regional basis to all hotels in the managers hotel system chain services include central training advertising and promotion national reservation systems computerized payroll and accounting services and such additional services as needed which may be more efficiently performed on a centralized basis costs and expenses incurred in providing such services are allocated among the hotels managed owned or leased by the manager on a fair and equitable basis in addition our managers generally will sponsor a guest rewards program the costs of which will be charged to all of the hotels that participate in such program  we are obligated to provide the manager with sufficient funds generally 5 of the revenue generated at the hotel to cover the cost of a certain nonroutine repairs and maintenance to the hotels which are normally capitalized and b replacements and renewals to the hotels furniture fixtures and equipment under certain circumstances we will be required to establish escrow accounts for such purposes under terms outlined in the agreements  we generally are limited in our ability to sell lease or otherwise transfer the hotels unless the transferee assumes the related management agreement however most agreements include owner rights to terminate the agreements on the basis of the managers failure to meet certain performancebased metrics typically these criteria are subject to the managers ability to cure and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts or in some instances waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees  in addition to any performancebased or other termination rights we have negotiated with marriott and starwood specific termination rights related to specific agreements these termination rights can take a number of different forms including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation as well as termination without sale or other condition which may require payment of a fee these termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by ebitda require that a certain number of properties continue to maintain the brand affiliation or be restricted to a specific pool of assets    145    table of contents host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued    15 geographic and

third parties for leases or debt that are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements due to various dispositions spinoffs and contractual arrangements but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including the default by an unrelated party we may also have contingent environmental liabilities related to the presence of hazardous or toxic substances we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees and contingencies to be remote the guarantees and contingencies are listed below            we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested nonlodging properties these primarily represent certain restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately 21 million as of december 31 2012            in 1997 we owned leisure park venture limited partnership which owns and operates a senior living facility we spunoff the partnership to barceló as part of the reit conversion but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with respect to 147 million of municipal bonds issued by the new jersey economic development authority through their maturity in 2027 however to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee we have been indemnified by barceló who in turn is indemnified by the current owner of the facility            in connection with the sale of two hotels in january 2005 we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases the future minimum lease payments are approximately 12 million through the full term of the leases including renewal options we believe that the likelihood of any material payments related to these ground leases is remote and in each case we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel            in connection with the sale of the atlanta marriott marquis in january 2013 we retained 5 million of contingent liabilities related to potential environmental liabilities    146    table of contents host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries  notes to

losses related to these proceedings could be as much as 53 million we believe this range represents the maximum potential loss for all of our legal proceedings with the exception of the san antonio
