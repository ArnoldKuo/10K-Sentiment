1business host inc was incorporated as a maryland corporation in 1998 and operates as a selfmanaged and selfadministered reit host inc owns properties and conducts operations through host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and in which it holds approximately 987 of the partnership interests op units as of december 31 2013 the remaining partnership interests are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lps daytoday management and control as of february 14 2014 our consolidated lodging portfolio consists of 114 primarily luxury and upperupscale hotels containing approximately 60000 rooms with the majority located in the united states and with 15 of the properties located outside of the us in canada new zealand chile australia mexico and brazil we also are developing two hotels in rio de janeiro brazil in addition we own noncontrolling interests in two international joint ventures a joint venture in europe which owns 19 luxury and upper upscale hotels with approximately 6400 rooms in france italy spain the netherlands the united kingdom belgium poland germany and sweden and a joint venture in asiapacific which owns one upscale hotel in australia and minority interests in two operating hotels one upscale and one midscale in india and five additional hotels in india currently under development we also hold noncontrolling investments in the 255room hyatt place nashville downtown in tennessee a 131unit vacation ownership project under development adjacent to our hyatt regency maui resort amp spa and the philadelphia marriott downtown in which we sold an 89 ownership interest in january 2014 the lodging industry the lodging industry in the united states consists of private and public entities that operate in an extremely diversified market under a variety of brand names the lodging industry has several key participants ownersown the hotel and typically enter into an agreement for an independent third party to manage the hotel these properties may be branded and operated under the managers brand or branded under a franchise agreement and operated by the franchisee or by an independent hotel manager the properties also may be operated as an independent hotel by an independent hotel manager ownermanagersown the hotel and operate the property with their own management team these properties may be branded under a franchise agreement operated as an independent hotel or operated under the owners brand we are prohibited from operating and managing hotels under applicable reit rules 1  franchisorsown a brand or brands and strive to grow their revenues by expanding the number of hotels in their franchise system franchisors provide their hotels with brand recognition marketing support and centralized reservation systems for the franchised hotels franchisormanagersown a brand or brands and also operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner or franchisee managersoperate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner but do not themselves own a brand the hotels may be operated under a franchise agreement or as an independent hotel the hotel manager is responsible for the daytoday operation of the hotel including the employment of hotel staff the determination of room rates the development of sales and marketing plans the preparation of operating and capital expenditure budgets and the preparation of financial reports for the owner they typically receive fees based on the revenues and profitability of the hotel the lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different segments each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs luxury upper upscale upscale midscale with and without food and beverage service and economy our portfolio primarily consists of luxury and upper upscale properties that are located in the central business districts of major cities near airports and resortconference destinations which are operated under internationally recognized brand names such as marriott hyatt starwood and accor see  our hotel portfolio revenues earned at our hotels consist of three broad categories rooms food and beverage and other revenues while approximately 65 of our revenue is generated from room sales many of our properties feature a variety of amenities that help drive demand and profitability our hotels typically include meeting and banquet facilities a variety of restaurants and lounges swimming pools exercise facilities andor spas gift shops and parking facilities the combination of which enable them to serve business leisure and group travelers the following graphs summarize the composition of the 114 hotels in our consolidated portfolio based on the percentage of revenues represented by our luxury upper upscale and other categories and by property type   2  our industry is influenced by the cyclical relationship between the supply of and demand for hotel rooms lodging demand growth typically is related to the vitality of the overall economy in addition to local market factors that stimulate travel to specific destinations in particular economic indicators such as gdp growth business investment and employment growth are some of the primary drivers of lodging demand the global recession of 2008 and 2009 resulted in a considerable decline both in consumer and business spending and a severe decline in demand within the lodging industry beginning in 2010 as economic conditions gradually have stabilized and strengthened lodging demand has improved steadily driven by moderate gdp growth in the us coupled with increasing business investment the primary demand driver has been transient demand from business and leisure travelers and to a much lesser degree group business we expect demand to continue to improve in 2014 as the potential for growth in group business and expected continued growth in transient business could lead to further revpar improvements however several economic headwinds may hamper lodging demand including the expected tapering of the us federal reserve bondbuying program known as quantitative easing the tenuous nature of the euro zone recovery the slowdown in growth in china and general instability in emerging markets lodging supply growth generally is driven by overall lodging demand as extended periods of strong demand growth tend to encourage new development however the rate of supply growth also is influenced by a number of additional factors including the availability of capital interest rates construction costs and unique market considerations the relatively long leadtime required to complete the development of hotels makes supply growth easier to forecast than demand growth but increases the volatility of the cyclical behavior of the lodging industry as illustrated in the charts below for the us lodging industry at different points in the cycle demand may increase when there is no new supply or supply may grow when demand is declining the decline in lodging demand during the recession of 2008 through 2009 and the lack of available financing for new hotel construction caused a significant reduction in hotel development as a result supply growth was relatively low in 2010 through 2013 overall we expect domestic supply growth to remain constrained in 2014 at approximately 15 which still is below the historical average of approximately 2 additionally we believe that the average supply growth for upper upscale hotels in our markets will be approximately 09 in 2014 however new york city and washington dc are expected to experience above average growth in supply which will increase competition in these markets we anticipate that demand growth will exceed supply growth in the near term resulting in continued growth in revenue per available room revpar which is consistent with analysis prepared by pkf hospitality research revpar is a commonly used operational measure of hotel performance in the lodging industry calculated as the product of average room rate and occupancy percentage occupancy levels in the upperupscale market currently are above their 15year average therefore while there is potential for occupancy growth we believe revpar growth primarily will be driven by increases in average room rate however there can be no assurance that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties or improvement in margins will continue for any number of reasons including those discussed above 3  our portfolio primarily consists of upper upscale hotels and accordingly its performance is best understood in comparison to the upper upscale segment rather than the entire industry the charts below detail the historical supply demand and revpar growth for the us lodging industry and for the us upper upscale segment for 2009 to 2013 and forecast data for 2014 us lodging industry supply demand and revpar growth us upper upscale supply demand and revpar growth   business strategy our primary longterm business objective is to provide superior total returns to our equity holders through a combination of appreciation in asset values growth in earnings and dividend distributions to achieve this objective we seek to drive operating results at our properties through aggressive asset management acquire properties in urban and resortconference destinations we will continue to focus on target markets in gateway domestic cities such as new york washington dc boston miami chicago los angeles san francisco san diego seattle and hawaii and international cities such as london paris munich berlin madrid barcelona stockholm 4  sydney tokyo rio de janeiro são paulo and mexico city which we believe have strong demand generators that appeal to multiple customer segments and have high barriers to entry that limit new supply while our focus will remain primarily on luxury and upper upscale properties we will remain opportunistic and may acquire or develop hotels in other lodging segments or markets wherever possible match each property with the appropriate manager and brand affiliation for the majority of our portfolio we seek properties that are franchised or operated by leading management companies as we believe their widespread brand recognition and brand loyalty programs can maximize demand we will also look for opportunities to enhance flexibility in our management agreements which can increase the market value of the property strategically invest in major redevelopment and return on investment roi projects in order to maximize the inherent value in our portfolio maintain a strong balance sheet with a low leverage level and balanced debt maturities in order to minimize our cost of capital and to maximize our financial flexibility in order to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging cycle expand our global portfolio holdings and revenue sources through joint ventures or direct acquisitions that diversify our investments and recycle capital through the disposition of assets to better align our portfolio within our target gateway markets we also may opportunistically dispose of hotels to take advantage of market conditions or in situations where the hotels are at a competitive risk since 2002 the percentage of revenues from our target markets in the us and internationally has increased from approximately 55 to 75 the following graph summarizes the composition of our consolidated hotels by market based on percentage of revenues which excludes properties owned by our european and asiapacific joint ventures  acquisitions and development our acquisition strategy focuses on acquiring hotels at attractive yields that exceed our cost of capital in our target markets as discussed above these markets consist of gateway cities in the us and in key international cities that are positioned to attract premium corporate leisure and international travelers and have significant barriers to entry based on historical trends we believe these markets will have favorable longterm supply and demand dynamics and consequently better potential for revenue growth in the us we will focus primarily on acquiring upper upscale and luxury hotels at prices below replacement cost and secondarily developing midscale and upscale hotels with strategic partners in target markets our efforts in europe will include the acquisition of upper upscale and luxury hotels in our target markets through our european joint venture in the 5  asiapacific and latin america regions we will concentrate both on the acquisition of upper upscale and luxury hotels and the development of midscale and upscale hotels in our target markets which we may look to acquire directly or through joint ventures with strategic partners we may acquire additional properties through various structures including transactions involving single assets portfolios joint ventures and acquisitions of the securities or assets of other reits value enhancement initiatives we look to enhance the value of our portfolio by identifying and executing strategies designed to achieve the highest and best use of our properties these projects have included the development of timeshare office space or condominium units on excess land redevelopment or expansion of existing retail space the purchase or extension of ground leases the acquisition of air rights or development entitlements or the restructuring of management agreements we believe that the successful execution of these projects will create significant value for the company redevelopment and return on investment projects we pursue opportunities to enhance asset value by completing select capital improvements outside the scope of recurring renewal and replacement capital expenditures these projects are designed to take advantage of changing market conditions and the favorable location of our properties to increase profitability and enhance customer satisfaction we also evaluate our capital expenditures projects based on their environmental impact in collaboration with our hotel managers we evaluate new products and systems designed to optimize energy performance and reduce water consumption many of these sustainability projects include the renewal and replacement of systems and equipment reaching the end of its life cycle with more efficient solutions and incorporating sustainable materials and construction practices within renovation projects we also invest in building infrastructure projects that mitigate potential risks associated with extreme weather events or climate change our capital expenditures projects generally fall into the following categories redevelopment projects these projects are designed to optimally position our hotels within their markets and competitive set redevelopment projects include extensive renovations of guest rooms including bathrooms lobbies food and beverage outlets expanding ballroom and meeting rooms and major mechanical system upgrades targeted return on investment projects these roi projects often are smaller and focused on specific areas such as converting unprofitable or underutilized space into meeting space adding guestrooms or implementing a building automation system acquisition capital expenditures projects in connection with the acquisition of a property we prepare capital and operational improvement plans designed to improve profitability and enhance the guest experience these projects may include required renewal and replacement projects significant redevelopment and even rebranding of the property and represent a key component of our decision to invest in a hotel and typically are completed within two to three years of acquisition renewal and replacement capital expenditures we work closely with our managers to ensure that renewal and replacement capital expenditures are spent efficiently in order to maximize the profitability of the hotel while minimizing disruption to operations typically room renovations occur at intervals of approximately seven years but the timing may vary based on the type of property and equipment being replaced these refurbishments generally are divided into the following types soft goods case goods bathroom and infrastructure soft goods include items such as carpeting bed spreads curtains and wall vinyl and may require more frequent updates in order to maintain brand quality standards case goods include items such as dressers desks couches restaurant and meeting room chairs and tables and generally are not replaced as frequently bathroom renovations include the replacement of tile vanity lighting and plumbing fixtures infrastructure includes the physical plant of the hotel including the roof elevators façade and fire systems asset management as the owner of a diverse portfolio of properties we are in a unique position to work with our managers to maximize revenues while minimizing operating costs the size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading operators and brands in the industry allow us to benchmark similar hotels and identify best practices and efficiencies that can improve the longterm profitability of our hotels by driving group business which allows our operators to shift the mix of business to the higherrated transient segments we also carefully evaluate our management and franchise agreements prior to the acquisition of a new hotel or upon termination of an existing contract this may include obtaining franchise rights for hotels and hiring an independent operator to manage the hotel which may be more efficient for some hotels while still maintaining the brand recognition of the existing manager see operational agreements for further discussion capital structure and liquidity profile in order to maintain its qualification as a reit host inc is required to distribute 90 of its taxable income other than net capital gain to its stockholders and as a result generally relies on external sources of capital as well as cash from operations to finance growth we use a variety of debt and equity instruments to fund our external growth including senior notes and mortgage debt exchangeable debentures common and preferred stock offerings issuances of op units and joint ventureslimited partnerships to take advantage of the prevailing market conditions while we may issue debt at any time management believes it is prudent over time to target a leverage ratio of approximately 30x debttoebitda we believe that lower leverage reduces our overall cost of capital and our earnings volatility and increases our access to capital thereby providing us with 6  the necessary flexibility to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging cycle which we consider a key competitive advantage we also seek to structure our debt profile to allow us to access different forms of financing primarily senior notes and exchangeable debentures as well as mortgage debt particularly outside of the us when debt is priced reasonably and can be denominated in the local currency generally this means we look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt minimize nearterm maturities and maintain a balanced maturity schedule joint ventures we expect to continue to utilize joint ventures to finance external growth we believe joint ventures provide a significant means to access external capital and spread the inherent risk of hotel ownership our primary focus for joint ventures is in international markets which helps to diversify exposure to market risk dispositions our disposition strategy is aligned with our overall portfolio focus to reallocate our investments to target gateway markets generally our dispositions will be focused on secondary or tertiary markets or as part of our strategy to limit our total investment within individual markets we may dispose of assets in our target markets through direct sales or through the creation of joint ventures when we have the opportunity to capitalize on value enhancement strategies and apply the proceeds to other business objectives additionally we will dispose of properties where we believe the potential for growth is constrained or on properties with significant capital expenditure requirements where we do not believe we would generate a significant return on the investment proceeds from dispositions are deployed to repay debt or fund acquisitions and roiredevelopment projects corporate responsibility hosts corporate responsibility strategy integrates fiscal environmental and social elements at both the corporate and portfolio levels our corporate responsibility program focuses on the following themes and objectives responsible investment invest in proven sustainability practices that create and drive valueenvironmental stewardship monitor and improve the resource efficiency and environmental footprint of our properties and corporate citizenship strengthen local communities through financial support community engagement and volunteer service management and governance our corporate responsibility program is managed by our corporate responsibility team and governed by the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors operating structure host inc operates through an umbrella partnership structure in which substantially all of its assets are held by host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and holds approximately 987 of the op units as of december 31 2013 a reit is a corporation that has elected to be treated as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code and that meets certain ownership organizational and operating requirements set forth under the code in general through payments of dividends to stockholders a reit is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level each op unit owned by holders other than host inc is redeemable at the option of the holder for an amount of cash equal to the market value of one share of host inc common stock multiplied by a factor of 1021494 rather than a conversion factor of 1 shareop unit that existed prior to the december 2009 stock dividend host inc has the right to acquire any op unit offered for redemption directly from the holder in exchange for 1021494 shares of host inc common stock instead of host lp redeeming such op unit for cash additionally for every share of common stock issued by host inc host lp will issue 97895 op units to host inc as of december 31 2013 noncontrolling limited partners held 95 million op units which were convertible into 97 million host inc common shares assuming that all op units held by noncontrolling limited partners were converted into common shares there would have been 7645 million common shares of host inc outstanding at december 31 2013 7  our operating structure is as follows  because host inc has elected to be treated as a reit certain tax laws limit the amount of nonqualifying income that host inc and host lp can earn including income derived directly from the operation of hotels as a result we lease substantially all of our consolidated properties to certain of our subsidiaries designated as taxable reit subsidiaries trs for federal income tax purposes or to third party lessees our trs are subject to income tax and are not limited as to the amount of nonqualifying income they can generate our trs enter into agreements with third parties to manage the operations of the hotels our trs also may own assets engaging in other activities that produce nonqualifying income such as the development of timeshare or condominium units subject to certain restrictions the difference between the hotels net operating cash flow and the aggregate rents paid to host lp is retained by our trs as taxable income accordingly the net effect of the trs leases is that while as a reit host inc generally is exempt from federal income tax to the extent that it meets specific distribution requirements among other reit requirements a portion of the net operating cash flow from our properties is subject to federal state and if applicable foreign income tax our hotel portfolio as of february 14 2014 we owned a portfolio of 114 hotel properties of which 99 are located in the united states and 15 are located in australia brazil canada chile mexico and new zealand our consolidated hotels located outside the united states collectively contain approximately 3826 rooms approximately 5 of our revenues were attributed to the operations of these foreign properties in each of 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we also are developing two hotel properties in brazilour consolidated hotels primarily consist of luxury and upper upscale properties all of our hotels generally are located in the central business districts of major cities near airports or in resortconference destinations that because of their locations typically benefit from barriers to entry for new supply thirtynine of our owned hotels representing approximately 63 of our revenues have in excess of 500 rooms the average age of our properties is 30 years although substantially all of the properties have benefited from significant renovations or major additions as well as regularly scheduled renewal and replacement and other capital improvements 8  by brand the following table details our consolidated hotel portfolio by brand as of february

january 10 2014 sale of an 89 interest in the property based on a market value of 303 million the property is subject to a mortgage loan of 230 millioncompetition the lodging industry is highly competitive competition often is specific to individual markets and is based on a number of factors including location brand guest facilities and amenities level of service room rates and the quality of accommodations the lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different segments each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs luxury upper upscale upscale midscale with and without food and beverage service and economy the classification of a property is based on lodging industry standards which take into consideration many factors such as guest facilities and amenities level of service and quality of accommodations most of our hotels operate in urban and resort markets either as luxury properties under such brand names as fairmont four seasons grand hyatt jw marriott ritzcarlton st regis the luxury collection and w or as upper upscale properties under such brand names as embassy suites hilton hyatt le méridien marriott executive apartments marriott marquis marriott suites pullman renaissance sheraton swissôtel and westin we also may selectively invest in upscale and midscale properties such as courtyard by marriott crowne plaza four points by sheraton hyatt place ibis novotel or residence inn by marriott particularly in international markets1 while our hotels primarily compete with other hotels in the luxury and upper upscale segments they also may compete with hotels in other lowertier segments in addition many management contracts for our hotels do not prohibit our managers from converting franchising or developing other hotel properties in our markets as a result our hotels compete with other hotels that our managers may own invest in manage or franchise we believe our properties enjoy competitive advantages associated with the hotel brands under which they operate the international marketing programs and reservation systems of these brands combined with the strong management systems and expertise they provide should enable our properties to perform favorably in terms of both occupancy and room rates in addition repeat guest business is enhanced by guest reward or guest recognition programs offered by most of these brands 1 this annual report contains registered trademarks that are the exclusive property of their respective owners which are companies other than us none of the owners of these trademarks their affiliates or any of their respective officers directors agents or employees has or will have any responsibility or liability for any information contained in this annual report12  we also compete with other reits and other public and private investors for the acquisition of new properties and investment opportunities both in domestic and international markets as we attempt to position our portfolio to take best advantage of changes in markets and travel patterns of our customers seasonality our hotel sales traditionally have experienced moderate seasonality which varies based on the individual property and the region hotel sales for our consolidated portfolio averaged approximately 24 27 23 and 26 for the first second third and fourth calendar quarters respectively in 2013 environmental and regulatory matters under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances these laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances in addition certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of hazardous or toxic materials and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released hazardous or toxic materials environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated and these restrictions may require corrective or other expenditures in connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels we potentially may be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities although currently we are not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us we can offer no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future operational agreements all of our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements with some of such hotels also subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operation under the designated brand under these agreements the managers generally have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the daytoday operation of the hotels including establishing room rates securing and processing reservations procuring inventories supplies and services providing periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers technical and operational experts and promoting and publicizing the hotels the managers provide all managerial and other employees for the hotels review the operation and maintenance of the hotels prepare reports budgets and projections and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels these support services include planning and policy services divisional financial services product planning and development employee staffing and training corporate executive management and certain inhouse legal services we have certain approval rights over budgets capital expenditures significant leases and contractual commitments and various other matters general terms and provisions  agreements governing the management and operation of our hotels typically include the terms described below term and fees for operational services the initial term of our management and operating agreements generally is 15 to 25 years with one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager the majority of our management agreements condition the managers right to exercise options for specified renewal terms upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria the manager typically receives compensation in the form of a base management fee which is calculated as a percentage generally 23 of annual gross revenues and an incentive management fee which typically is calculated as a percentage generally 1020 of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the hotel in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the base management fee is only 1 of annual gross revenues but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable to starwood under a separate license agreement as described below license services in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the operation of the hotels is subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to the designated brand including rights to use trademarks service marks and logos matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services although the term of these license agreements with starwood generally is coterminous with the corresponding operating agreements the license agreements contemplate the potential for continued brand affiliation even in the event of a termination of the operating agreement as noted above the starwood licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees generally 5 of gross revenues attributable to room sales and 2 of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales which amounts supplement the lower base management fee of 1 of gross revenues received by starwood under the operating agreements chain or system programs and services managers are required to provide chain or system programs and services generally that are furnished on a centralized basis such services include the development and operation of certain computer systems 13  and reservation services regional or other centralized management and administrative services marketing and sales programs and services training and other personnel services and other centralized or regional services as may be determined to be more efficiently performed on a centralized regional or group basis rather than on an individual hotel basis costs and expenses incurred in providing these chain or system programs and services generally are allocated on a cost reimbursement basis among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates or that otherwise benefit from these services working capital and fixed asset supplies we are required to maintain working capital for each hotel and to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies for example linen china glassware silver and uniforms we also are responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds available from working capital are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels for certain hotels the working capital accounts which would otherwise be maintained by the managers for each of such hotels are maintained on a pooled basis with managers being authorized to make withdrawals from such pooled account as otherwise contemplated with respect to working capital in accordance with the provisions of the management or operating agreements furniture fixtures and equipment replacements we are required to provide the managers with all furniture fixtures and equipment ffampe necessary for the operation of the hotels including funding any required ffampe replacements on an annual basis the managers prepare budgets for ffampe to be acquired and certain routine repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the necessary funds which budgets are subject to our review and approval for purposes of funding such expenditures a specified percentage typically 5 of the gross revenues of each hotel is deposited by the manager into an escrow or reserve account in our name to which the manager has access in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels our operating agreements contemplate that this reserve account also may be used to fund the cost of certain major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building as described below for certain of our marriottmanaged hotels we have entered into an agreement with marriott to allow for such expenditures to be funded from one pooled reserve account rather than funds being deposited into separate reserve accounts at each hotel with the minimum required balance maintained on an ongoing basis in that pooled reserve account being significantly below the amount that otherwise would have been maintained in such separate hotel reserve accounts for certain of our starwoodmanaged hotels the periodic reserve fund contributions which otherwise would be deposited into reserve accounts maintained by managers for each hotel are distributed to us and as to this pool of hotels we are responsible for providing funding of expenditures which otherwise would be funded from reserve accounts for each of the subject hotels building alterations improvements and renewals the managers are required to prepare an annual estimate of the expenditures necessary for major repairs alterations improvements renewals and replacements to the structural mechanical electrical heating ventilating air conditioning plumbing and elevators of each hotel along with alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required in the managers reasonable judgment to keep the hotel in a competitive efficient and economical operating condition that is consistent with brand standards we generally have approval rights as to such budgets and expenditures which we review and approve based on our managers recommendations and on our judgment expenditures for these major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building typically are funded directly by owners although as noted above our agreements with starwood contemplate that certain such expenditures may be funded from the reserve account treatment of additional owner funding as additional owner funding becomes necessary either for expenditures generally funded from the ffampe replacement funds or for any major repairs or improvements to the hotel building which may be required to be funded directly by owners most of our agreements provide for an economic benefit to us through an impact on the calculation of incentive management fees payable to our managers one approach frequently utilized at our marriottmanaged hotels is to provide such owner funding through loans which are repaid with interest from operational revenues with the repayment amounts reducing operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees another approach that is used at our starwoodmanaged hotels as well as with certain expenditures projects at our marriottmanaged hotels is to treat such owner funding as an increase to our investment in the hotel resulting in an increase to owners priority return with a corresponding reduction to the amount of operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees for our starwoodmanaged hotels that are subject to the pooled arrangement described above the amount of any additional reserve account funding is allocated to each of such hotels on a pro rata basis determined with reference to the net operating income of each hotel and the total net operating income of all such pooled hotels for the most recent operating year territorial protections certain management and operating agreements impose restrictions for a specified period which limit the manager and its affiliates from owning operating or licensing a hotel of the same brand within a specified area the area restrictions vary with each hotel from city blocks in urban areas to up to a multimile radius from the hotel in other areas sale of the hotel subject to specific agreements as to certain hotels see below under special termination rights we generally are limited in our ability to sell lease or otherwise transfer the hotels by the requirement that the transferee assume the related management agreements and meet specified other conditions including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the manager 14  performance termination rights in addition to any right to terminate that may arise as a result of a default by the manager most of our management and operating agreements include reserved rights by us to terminate management or operating agreements on the basis of the managers failure to meet certain performancebased metrics typically including a specified threshold return on owners investment in the hotel along with a failure of the hotel to achieve a specified revpar performance threshold established with reference to other competitive hotels in the market typically such performancebased termination rights arise in the event the operator fails to achieve specified performance thresholds over a consecutive twoyear period and are subject to the managers ability to cure and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts or in some instances waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees we have agreed in the past and may agree in the future to waive certain of these termination rights in exchange for consideration from a manager or its affiliates which consideration may include cash compensation or amendments to management agreements special termination rights in addition to any performancebased or other termination rights set forth in our management and operating agreements we have specific negotiated termination rights as to certain management and operating agreements with respect to our marriott portfolio subject to certain timing and other limitations these rights include termination rights applicable to 16 properties with respect to our starwood portfolio subject to certain timing and other limitations these rights include termination rights applicable to 8 properties we also have similar termination rights applicable to 8 other properties while the brand affiliation of a property may increase the value of a hotel the ability to dispose of a property unencumbered by a management agreement or even brand affiliation also can increase the value for prospective purchasers these termination rights can take a number of different forms including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation as well as termination without sale or other condition which may require payment of a fee these termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by ebitda require that a certain number of properties continue to maintain the brand affiliation or be restricted to a specific pool of assets employees as of december 31 2013 we had 242 employees of which 218 work in the united states we had 24 employees located in our offices in london rio de janeiro amsterdam and singapore none of hosts employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements other than those working in our office in rio de janeiro the number of employees referenced above does not include the hotel employees of our nine hotels in brazil new zealand and australia which while technically are host employees are under the direct supervision and control of our thirdparty hotel managers our thirdparty managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels although we do not manage employees at our consolidated hotels we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force particularly those hotels with unionized labor we believe relations with the employees of these third party managers are positive for a discussion of these relationships see part i item 1a risk factorswe are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor employees at certain of our thirdparty managed hotels are covered by collective bargaining
