 the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report overview host inc operates as a selfmanaged and selfadministered reit that owns properties and conducts operations through host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and in which it holds approximately 987 of its common op units as of december 31 2013 the remainder of host lps common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lps daytoday management and control host inc is the largest lodging reit in nareits composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotel properties as of february 14 2014 we own 114 hotels in the united states and internationally and have minority ownership interests in an additional 24 hotels through joint ventures in the united states europe and the asiapacific region these hotels are primarily operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry the majority are located in central business districts of major cities near airports and in resortconference destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors since 2002 the percentage of revenues from our target markets has increased from approximately 55 to 75 in 2013 as we have focused our acquisition efforts on these locations and similarly disposed of noncore assets while hotels in these markets still are subject to competitive pressures we believe this strategy of combining premium brands with superior locations provides opportunities to achieve room rate and occupancy premiums in excess of our competitors our customers the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient business group business and contract business which accounted for approximately 60 35 and 5 respectively of our 2013 room sales similar to the majority of the lodging industry we further categorize business within these broad groups based on characteristics they have in common as follows transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels therefore we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than trends in leisure demand the four key subcategories of the transient business group are retail this is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the general public it typically is the rate charged to travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discounted rates it includes the rack rate which typically is applied to rooms during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available retail room rates will fluctuate more freely depending on anticipated demand levels eg seasonality and weekday vs weekend stays nonqualified discount these include special rates offered by the hotels including packages advancepurchase discounts and promotional offers these also include rooms booked through online travel agencies otas special corporate this is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally these rates typically are negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated retail rate in addition this category includes rates offered at the prevailing per diem for approved government travelqualified discount this category encompasses all discount programs such as aaa and aarp discounts rooms booked through wholesale channels frequent guest program redemptions and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together usually with a minimum of 10 rooms the three key subcategories of the group business category are association group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions corporate group business related to corporate meetings eg product launches training programs contract negotiations and presentations other group business predominately related to social military education religious fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams otherwise known as smerf business contract business refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our airport hotels additionally contract rates may be utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand 37  understanding our performance our revenues and expenses our hotels are operated by thirdparty managers under longterm agreements pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel we provide operating funds or working capital which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages utilities property taxes and other hotellevel expenses we generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month which distribution reflects hotellevel sales less propertylevel operating expenses excluding depreciation revenue from owned hotels represents 99 of our total revenue the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue          of 2013revenues        rooms revenue occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue the business mix of the hotel group versus transient and retail versus discount business is a significant driver of room rates   64                   food and beverage revenue food amp beverage revenues consist of revenues from group functions which may include both banquet revenue and audio and visual revenues as well as outlet revenues from the restaurants and lounges at our properties   29                   other revenue occupancy the nature of the property eg resort etc and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue such as parking golf course spa entertainment and other guest services   6   hotel operating expenses represent approximately 97 of our total operating costs and expenses the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses          of 2013operatingcosts andexpenses        rooms expense these costs include housekeeping reservation systems room supplies laundry services and front desk costs occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages as well as on the level of service and amenities that are provided   19                    food and beverage expense these expenses primarily include food beverage and the associated labor costs and will correlate closely with food and beverage revenues group functions with banquet sales and audio and visual components will generally have lower overall costs as a percentage of revenues than outlet sales   23                    other departmental and support expenses these expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenue such as parking golf courses spas entertainment and other guest services as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments sales and marketing repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs   27                    management fees base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels   5                    other propertylevel expenses these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes ground rent equipment rent and property insurance many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenue at our hotels   8                    depreciation and amortization expense this is a noncash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of past capital expenditures   15    the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations it also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items taken separately these costs represent approximately 55 of our hotel operating expenses key performance indicators revenue per available room revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily 38  occupancy achieved revpar does not include food and beverage parking or other guest service revenues generated by the property although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues it is considered the key indicator of core revenues for many hotels revpar changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels as well as incremental operating profit than do changes that are driven by average room rate for example increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues such as food and beverage revenue as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services utilities and room amenity costs revpar increases due to higher room rates however will not result in additional roomrelated costs with the exception of those charged as a percentage of revenue as a result changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in revpar caused by occupancy levels in discussing our operating results we present revpar and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and which operations have been included in our consolidated results comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage or large scale capital improvements we also present revpar separately for our comparable consolidated domestic and international both on a nominal and constant dollar basis hotels as well as for our joint venture in europe we provide revpar results in constant currency due to the number of consolidated properties we have internationally and the effect that exchange rates have on our reporting we use constant currency because we believe it is useful to investors because it provides clarity on how the hotels are performing in their local markets for all other measures net income operating profit ebitda ffo etc our discussion is only in nominal us which is consistent with our financial statement presentation under gaapwe also evaluate the performance of our business through certain nongaap financial measures each of these nongaap financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues operating profit net income and earnings per share we provide a more detailed discussion of these nongaap financial measures how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in nongaap financial measures our nongaap financial measures include nareit funds from operations ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share we use nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share as supplemental measures of companywide profitability nareit adopted ffo in order to promote an industrywide measure of reit operating performance we also adjust nareit ffo for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt acquisition costs and litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business hotel adjusted operating profit and margins hotel adjusted operating profit measures propertylevel results before debt service depreciation and corporate expenses and is a supplemental measure of aggregate propertylevel profitability we use hotel adjusted operating profit and associated margins to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels ebitda and adjusted ebitda earnings before income taxes interest expense depreciation and amortization ebitda is a supplemental measure of the operating performance of our properties and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits hotel owners who are not reits and other capitalintensive companies we also adjust ebitda for gains and losses related to real estate transactions impairment losses and litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business adjusted ebitda 39  summary of

2012 and 2011 are based on 103 comparable hotels as of december 31 2012 2for a discussion of our constant us and nominal us presentation see comparable hotel operating statisticsin 2013 on a constant us basis revpar at our comparable hotels increased 58 compared to 2012 marking the fourth straight year of comparable revpar growth in excess of 55 while the overall growth in the economy since the 20082009 recession has been slow particularly with regards to gdp growth and the level of unemployment specific drivers of lodging demand have proven to be more resilient in particular corporate business which is one of the most important demand drivers of our portfolio has strengthened as corporate profits and business investment have increased at a much greater rate than the overall economy additionally our domestic target markets have benefited from an increase in demand from travel to the us as international arrivals increased on a constant us basis revpar at our comparable consolidated international hotels increased 39 in 2013 the increase reflects improvement in average room rate in all of our consolidated international markets largely offset by a decrease in occupancy of 56 percentage points at our properties in latin america which was negatively affected by ongoing construction at the jw marriott hotel mexico city revpar growth in 2013 at our comparable hotels was both rate and occupancy driven as room rates improved 42 on a nominal us basis and occupancy improved 100 basis points to 76 which is above our prerecession occupancy levels in 2007 our operators have been able to leverage the higher occupancy levels in order to gradually increase room rates particularly for our transient business therefore much of the room revenue improvement for the year was driven by improvement in transient demand as 40  transient revenue increased 75 benefiting from an increase in occupancy and a positive mix shift to higher rated business and group revenue increased 26 food and beverage revenues at our comparable hotels increased 40 for 2013 the increase was driven primarily by a positive mix shift to banquet and audio visual revenues which provide higher overall operating margins than outlet revenue as catered functions generally are more profitable additionally outlet revenue increased particularly in the second half of the year as a result of strategic efforts to drive food and beverage profitability by renovating and repositioning restaurants at certain of our properties food and beverage revenue has significantly benefited from restaurant repositionings and renovations completed over the past three years overall food and beverage revenues increased by 59 compared to 2012 in aggregate revenues for our owned hotels increased 327 million to 51 billion for the year while other revenues decreased 220 million the decline in other revenues was due to the expiration of the lease on the 53 courtyard by marriott hotels leased from hospitality properties trust hpt on december 31 2012 accordingly total revenues increased 107 million to approximately 52 billion for 2013 operating margins calculated based on gaap operating profit as a percentage of gaap revenues increased 270 basis points for the full year 2013 these operating margins are affected significantly by several items including operations from recently acquired hotels depreciation impairments and corporate expenses our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins which exclude these items increased 100 basis points to 255 the improvements were driven by the increase in average room rate as well as a 79 increase in comparable food and beverage profit net income for host inc improved 262 million in 2013 to 325 million net income benefited from the improvement in operating profit as well as a decrease in interest expense of 69 million due to the repayment or refinancing of debt at lower interest rates a decrease in impairment expense of 59 million and an increase in gains on hotel dispositions of 49 million adjusted ebitda which is defined as ebitda adjusted for gains and losses related to real estate transactions impairment expense and other items increased 116 million or 97 to 13 billionduring 2013 host incs diluted income per common share improved 034 per share to 042 per common share the improvement in our income per diluted share reflects the improvement in operating results at our hotels as described above host incs adjusted ffo per diluted share increased 191 to 131 per diluted share for 2013 the trends and transactions described above for host inc affected similarly the operating results for host lp as the only significant difference between the host inc and host lp statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the outside partners of host lp for the year host lps net income improved 262 million to 325 million and the diluted income per common unit improved 034 per common unit to 043 per common unit 2014 outlook we believe that the broad economic trends that have translated into the steady improvement in lodging demand should continue in 2014 in the united states according to blue chip economic indicators the consensus estimate for real gdp growth in 2014 currently is 28 this growth rate is a notable increase over 2013 due to an improved outlook surrounding private sector demand and consumer sentiment as well as business investment and international travel which are particularly important indicators of demand at properties located in our targeted gateway markets additionally significant impediments to growth due to governmental fiscal policy in 2013 such as the federal government shutdown in the fourth quarter uncertainty due to the threat of the potential us credit default and austerity efforts at the state and local levels are not expected to repeat or to have the same negative yearoveryear effect for 2014 at the same time however certain key factors continue to affect negatively the economic recovery and add to general market uncertainty these factors include but are not limited to continued political uncertainty with respect to us economic policy including the potential effects of the tapering of the bondbuying program by the federal reserve continued high levels of unemployment the tenuous nature of the euro zone recovery the slowdown in growth in china and slower growth and elevated risks associated with emerging markets as a result of these economic trends we believe the overall improvement in the economic climate will result in a steady increase in demand for our domestic portfolio during 2014in europe we expect moderate demand growth consistent with the slowly improving economic climate for the euro jv properties we anticipate that this moderate demand growth will lead to modest improvements in revpar our properties in latin america are expected to exhibit solid revpar improvement as rio de janeiro will benefit from increased leisure demand generated by the fifa world cup in the asiapacific region we expect that our properties in australia and new zealand will exhibit moderate growth in revpar as the increases in new supply will be low 41  over the same period we have experienced relatively low supply growth in upper upscale hotels in most of our target markets due to the long planning cycle of hotel development projects lack of available credit in prior years and the pricing of upper upscale hotels which have continued to trade below replacement cost as a result demand has exceeded supply growth in the industry overall we expect this trend to continue into 2014 with the exception of the new york and washington dc markets where supply growth is expected to exceed the historical industry average during 2014 as a result of these trends we continue to believe that the strong overall fundamentals in the lodging industry should drive improvements in revpar growth and operating results specifically based on our current group bookings we believe there is the potential for increasing group demand which would allow our operators to shift the business mix to higherrated corporate group and transient demand as opposed to lowerrated transient discount business as a result we believe the majority of the revpar growth for 2014 will be driven by improvements in average rate as we expect occupancy growth will be similar to that experienced in 2013 for the full year 2014 we believe these trends will result in improved operating performance and comparable hotel revpar growth on a constant us basis of 5 to 6 we anticipate that comparable food and beverage and other revenue will increase approximately 3 to 4 in 2014 driven in part by the expected increase in group demandwhile we believe that the lodging industry will continue to improve there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons including but not limited to slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns see part i item 1a risk factorsinvesting activities acquisitions and development we continue to seek investment opportunities in our target markets which we have identified as those that are expected to have the greatest lodging demand growth the fewest additions to supply and the strongest potential for revenue growth we see increased competition for acquisitions in our target markets due to the accessibility of capital and the current availability of inexpensive financing consequently pricing for upper upscale and luxury assets has become more aggressive and recent transaction values have approached replacement cost levels our acquisition strategy also includes the acquisition or development of midscale and upscale properties in select target markets since january 1 2013 we have completed the following transactions acquisitionssubsequent to yearend 2013 we acquired the 151room powell hotel in san francisco including the fee simple interest in the land for 75 million the property includes a significant longterm retail lease with sephora a leading provider of perfume and cosmetics we intend to invest 22 million in an extensive redevelopment of the property beginning late in 2014on may 31 2013 we acquired the feesimple interest in the 426room hyatt place waikiki beach in honolulu hawaii for 1385 million in december 2013 we made the final incremental payment of 199 million for the purchase of the fee simple interest in the land at the new york marriott marquis times square in addition 25 million of the payments made pursuant to the terms of the ground lease have been attributed towards the purchase of the land the purchase was completed in conjunction with our 2012 lease of the existing retail space to vornado realty trust and its ongoing redevelopment which is expected to be completed in early 2015 developmenton november 12 2013 we opened the 255room hyatt place nashville downtown through a 5050 joint venture with white lodging services total development costs for the project are approximately 43 million we have contributed approximately 6 million to the joint venture we have invested approximately r94 million 45 million as of december 31 2013 related to the development of two hotels totaling 405 rooms in rio de janeiro the hotels are expected to open in the second quarter of 2014 and will be managed by accor under the ibis and novotel brands our total investment is expected to be r131 million 67 million we hold a 67 noncontrolling interest in a 131unit vacation ownership project under development in maui hawaii adjacent to our hyatt regency maui resort amp spa the total development cost of the project is expected to be 200 million of which 110 million will be financed through a construction loan we have contributed 47 million including land valued at 36 million as of december 2013 sales of the timeshares are underway and we anticipate the project to open in late 2014 42  dispositions  we have sold seven properties five in 2013 two in 2014 since january 1 2013 for a total sales price of 960 million these properties are noncore assets where we believe the potential for growth is constrained or where we were able to opportunistically take advantage of pricing in the market significant dispositions includethe february 12 2014 sale of courtyard nashua for 10 millionthe january 10 2014 sale of 89 of the philadelphia marriott downtown based on a market value of 303 million total proceeds were 290 million which includes our 11 portion of the proceeds received from the 230 million mortgage debt issued by the partnership at closingthe december 18 2013 sale of the dallasaddison marriott quorum by the galleria for 56 millionthe november 20 2013 sale of the four seasons hotel atlanta for 63 millionthe november 1 2013 sale of the portland marriott downtown waterfront for 87 millionthe june 28 2013 sale of the ritzcarlton san francisco for 161 million andthe january 11 2013 sale of the atlanta marriott marquis for 293 millionduring 2014 we believe the disposition market should remain favorable particularly for assets in our target markets we are also seeing increased interest in our nontarget markets as a result of increased liquidity and plan to remain opportunistic with our disposition activityvalue enhancement initiatives we also look to enhance the value of our portfolio by identifying and executing strategies designed to achieve the highest and best use of all aspects of our properties this may include extending ground leases or restructuring management agreements as well as developing or disposing of underutilized space connected to our properties we believe that the successful execution of these projects will create significant value for the company during 2013 we completed the following valueenhancement projects on april 1 2013 we sold approximately four acres of excess land adjacent to our newport beach marriott hotel amp spa to a luxury homebuilder for 24 million and recognized a 21 million gain on the sale the land which previously was used for tennis courts has been approved for the development and sale of 79 luxury condominiums we reached an agreement with the city of houston for a new 40year ground lease for the houston airport marriott which was set to expire in 2019 under the terms of the agreement in addition to the extension the ground lease expense as a percentage of revenues has been reduced in return for an investment of approximately 35 million to renovate and enhance the hotel including complete renovation of the guestrooms and public spaces as well as elevator and systems upgrades we successfully converted the memphis marriott downtown to the sheraton memphis downtown which is franchised and managed by davidson hotels amp resorts and are in the process of completing the capital plan to reposition the property we believe that this transaction matches the appropriate brand operator and capital plan for the market and as a result will increase the value of the property we reached an agreement with marriott international with respect to the calgary marriott downtown we agreed to extend the term of the management agreement and received an increase in the owners priority threshold which will reduce current and future management fees we intend to invest 23 million in repositioning capital expenditures at the hotel in connection with the negotiation of the franchise and management agreements described above we also received the right from marriott international to franchise three additional hotels and accelerated a similar franchise right on a fourth hotel we believe that this additional flexibility substantially improves the value of these hotels by increasing the potential pool of interested buyers43  capital expenditures projects we continue to pursue opportunities to enhance asset value through select capital improvements including projects that are designed specifically to increase the ecoefficiency of our hotels incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology during 2013 we completed renovations of 6900 guestrooms over 420000 square feet of meeting space and

constant us and nominal us presentation see comparable hotel operating statistics2the 2012 results include one additional day of operations in february compared to 2013 due to the leap year in 2012  for 2013 our top performing markets were houston seattle and san francisco with revpar increases of 151 109 and 102 respectively the increase in our houston market primarily resulted from higher average room rates as these hotels shifted from lowerrated group and transient business to higherrated segments as well as aggressive pricing increases in group for both retail and special corporate business the increase in our seattle market reflects a 67 increase in average room rate and a 30 percentage point increase in average occupancy driven by higherrated group and transient demand revpar growth in our san francisco market 48  was driven entirely by rate improvements from an improved business mix occupancy declined slightly during the year but still remained at over 80 as strong transient and group demand throughout the city have translated to revpar gains at our properties revpar for our atlanta hotels increased 96 for 2013 reflecting a strong citywide and special event calendar during the year that drove group and transient demandfor 2013 our los angeles market revpar increased 78 primarily due to improved average room rates as a result of increased transient business driven by a mix shift to higherrated segments and increased corporate group businessfor 2013 our florida hotels increased revpar 73 as a result of a 54 increase in average room rate and 13 percentage point increase in average occupancy driven by strong leisure demandour boston market revpar increased 72 as a result of a 35 percentage point increase in average occupancy and a 24 increase in average room rate due to strong group performance and transient business due in part to major league baseballs playoff and world series events and the favorable 2012 comparisons related to hurricane sandy our new york hotels increased revpar 60 as a result of a 31 percentage point increase in average occupancy and a 22 increase in average room rate in 2012 revpar growth was negatively affected by hurricane sandy in the fourth quarter and renovation disruption at several of our new york hotels in 2013 revpar results have been tempered by supply growth in this marketfor 2013 our washington dc market revpar increased only 10 due to a 10 percentage point increase in average occupancy resulting from transient room nights for 2013 the sequestration and us federal government shutdown negatively impacted this market by lowering demand for government and related industry businessinternationally revpar in our asiapacific and canadian markets increased 81 and 65 respectively on a constant us basis for 2013 the increase at our asiapacific hotels resulted from a 48 increase in average room rate and a 25 percentage point increase in average occupancy driven by transient demand and the results of renovations completed in 2012 the improvement in revpar at our canadian hotels was primarily driven by an increase in average room rate revpar at our latin american

our property types see comparable hotel operating statistics for 2013 our suburban properties led the portfolio with a 71 increase in revpar as stable average occupancy levels at these properties have allowed operators to increase average daily room rates we believe strong demand that has led to high average occupancy and increasing rates in adjacent urban markets has contributed to an increase in demand at our suburban properties for 2013 our resortconference hotels experienced revpar growth of 67 driven by a 48 increase in average room rate and a 12 percentage point increase in average occupancy due to higher demand our urban properties experienced a revpar growth of 52 for 2013 as results were mixed throughout these markets strength in several of our west coast markets as well as our houston and atlanta markets were partially offset by weakness in our washington dc and philadelphia markets 49  hotel sales by business mix the majority of our customers fall into three broad categories transient group and contract business the information below is derived from business mix results from 102 comparable hotels for which 2013 and 2012 business mix information is available in 2013 overall revenue growth was due mainly to transient revenues improving 75 compared to the prior year consisting of a 40 average room rate increase coupled with a 34 growth in transient room nights

compared to 2011 during 2012 total revenue increased 345 million or 73 primarily as a result of growth in room revenues reflecting an increase in revpar and growth in fampb revenues in addition revenues benefited from the acquisition of one hotel in july 2012 and a full year of operations for 10 hotels acquired in 2011 revenues for properties sold in 2012 or 2011 have been reclassified to discontinued operations rooms room revenues increased 233 million or 82 to 3082 million in 2012 due to strong growth in room rates coupled with a growth in average occupancy comparable hotel revpar

second half of the year as new and recently renovated restaurants performed well in addition fampb revenues for 2012 increased 31 million due to incremental revenues from recently acquired hotels other revenues from owned hotels during 2012 other revenues from owned hotels increased 8 million or 29 to 287 million the improvement primarily resulted from an increase in operating departments such

or 84 to 271 million in 2012 the improvement was due to 5 million in retail lease revenue at the new york marriott marquis as a result of the new lease agreement with vornado realty trust as well as

consist of both fixed and variable components are affected by a number of factors as previously discussed room expense is affected mainly by occupancy which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping reservation systems room supplies laundry services and front desk costs food and beverage expense correlates closely with food and beverage revenues and is affected by occupancy and the mix of business between banquet and audiovisual and outlet sales however the most significant expense for both room expense and food and beverage expense is related to wages and employee benefits which comprise approximately 55 of these expenses in any year other propertylevel expenses consist of property taxes which are highly dependent on local taxing authorities and property and general liability insurance and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels the overall increases in operating expenses in 2013 and 2012 are consistent with higher overall revenues at our properties the yearoveryear increases also reflect the incremental expenses from our recently acquired properties for 2013 the recently acquired properties include the hyatt place waikiki beach that was purchased in may 2013 and six months of incremental operations for the grand hyatt washington for 2012 the recently acquired properties include the grand hyatt washington that was purchased

operations rooms room expenses increased 58 million during 2013 reflecting an increase of 51 at our comparable hotels primarily driven by higher travel agent commissions and wages and benefit expenses additionally rooms expenses increased 12 million for 2013 due to incremental expenses from our recent acquisitions the increase in room expenses for 2012 reflects an increase of 55 at our comparable hotels as a result of higher average occupancy as well as higher wage rates and benefits rooms expenses for 2012 increased an incremental 19 million as a result of acquired hotels food and beverage fampb expenses increased 46 million during 2013 comparable fampb expenses increased just 27 as much of the revenue improvement was driven by increases in banquet and audio visual revenues which have higher overall operating margins than outlet revenue as a percentage of revenues fampb expenses decreased 100 basis points for our comparable hotels during 2013 fampb expenses also increased an incremental 13 million due to our recent acquisitions the increase in fampb expenses for 2012 was a result of a 36 increase at our comparable hotels reflecting higher wages and benefits partially offset by a slight improvement in productivity fampb expenses for 2012 also increased an incremental 21 million as a result of acquired hotels other departmental and support expenses other departmental and support expenses increased 30 million in 2013 primarily due to increases in loyalty program rewards wages and benefits and credit card expenses other departmental and support expenses for 2013 also included an incremental 13 million from our recent acquisitions for 2012 the increase in these expenses was driven primarily by higher sales and marketing expenses which are variable and dependent upon revenues such as loyalty rewards expense and national sales allocations these increases partially were offset by lower centralized accounting charges and lower utility rates and consumption for 2012 acquired hotels also increased other departmental and support expenses by an incremental 24 million 53  management fees management fees which generally are calculated as a percentage of revenues and operating profit increased 116 to 222 million for 2013 base management fees which are calculated as a percentage of total revenues increased 11 million in 2013 incentive

in 2012 as a result of acquired hotels other propertylevel expenses these expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance other propertylevel expenses decreased 200 million or 347 due to the expiration of the hpt leases on december 31 2012 excluding the effects of the hpt leases other propertylevel expenses increased 34 million or 10 in 2013 due to an increase in real estate taxes as well as 5 million due to incremental expenses from our recent acquisitions for 2012 expenses increased 22 million or 40 due mainly to increases in property taxes and expenses related to hotels leased from hpt as well as the inclusion of expenses from recently acquired hotels depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased 25 million or 35 to 697 million in 2013 the decrease is due to a decline in noncash impairment expenses of 59 million partially offset by an increase due to recent acquisitions and capital expenditures for 2012 depreciation and amortization expense increased 113 million or 186 to 722 million which includes a 60 million noncash impairment charge related to the

were affected by an earthquake in february 2011 in 2012 we also recorded a gain of 2 million related to property insurance for two hotels in chile both of which were affected by an earthquake in february 2010 for further information on our insurance settlements see note 13 to our consolidated financial settlements  gain on insurance settlements interest income interest income in 2013 decreased approximately 19 million due to the 2012 maturity of the mortgage loan investment associated with the portfolio of five hotels acquired by the euro jv in november 2012 for 2012 and 2011 interest income primarily was attributable to amounts earned on this mortgage of 20 million and 17 million respectively interest expense interest expense decreased 69 million or 185 in 2013 due to the repayment or refinancing of debt that resulted in a decrease in our weighted average interest rates and overall debt balance total debt extinguishment costs increased 6 million in 2013 interest expense increased 2 million or 05 in 2012 the increase is due primarily to a 21 million increase in debt extinguishment costs which was partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate and overall debt balances in addition savings from our fixedtofloating interest rate swap reduced interest expense by 7 million in 2013 and 6 million for each of 2012 and 2011 the following table presents

reflects the cash interest expense for refinanced debt subsequent to the issuance of the new financing and prior to the repayment of the refinanced debt net gains on property transactions and other net gains on property transactions increased 20 million in 2013 due to the 21 million gain on the sale of land adjacent to our newport beach marriott hotel amp spa and a deferred 11 million gain related to an eminent domain claim by the state of georgia of 29 acres of land for the highway expansion at the atlanta marriott perimeter center the increase in 2012 was due to the 8 million gain related to the sale of land to the maui jv compared to a 2 million gain recorded in 2011 for the transfer of the le méridien piccadilly to the euro jv benefit provision for income taxes we lease substantially all of our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as trs for federal income tax purposes the difference between hotellevel operating cash flow and the aggregate rent paid to host lp by the trs represents taxable income or loss on which we record an income tax provision or benefit the decrease in the tax provision in 2013 reflects a decrease in taxable income at the trs due to an increase in rent expense in excess of the increase in operating profit from the hotels and a reduction of certain foreign taxes while the increase in 2012 reflects yearoveryear improvements in property operations recognized by our trs as well as increases in certain foreign taxes income loss from discontinued operations discontinued operations consist of five hotels disposed of in 2013

of host inc and host lp the liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp are derived primarily from the activities of host lp which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations the incurrence of debt and the issuance of op units host incs only significant asset is the ownership of partnership interests of host lp therefore its financing and investing activities are conducted through host lp except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock proceeds from stock issuances by host inc are contributed to host lp in exchange for op units additionally funds used by host inc to pay dividends or to repurchase stock are provided by host lp therefore while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between host inc and host lp we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion applies both to host inc and host lp overview we look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash debt and equity in order to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry as operations have improved we have maintained our focus on strategically decreasing our debttoequity ratio through i acquisitions and other investments the majority of which were completed with available cash and proceeds from equity issuances and ii the repayment and refinancing of senior notes and mortgage debt in order to extend maturity dates and lower interest rates we have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt we have access to multiple types of financing as approximately 83 of our debt consists of senior notes exchangeable debentures and borrowings under our credit facility none of which are collateralized by specific hotel properties during 2013 our senior notes were rated investment grade by both moodys and standard amp poors and we subsequently issued 400 million of senior notes at 3¾ in 2013 we repaid 800 million of senior notes and 277 million of mortgage debt and refinanced 150 million of mortgage debt additionally only 10 of our consolidated hotels which represented just 3 of our 2013 revenues will be encumbered by mortgage debt subsequent to the repayment of a mortgage loan on march 1 2014 55  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our portfolio withstand declines in operating cash flow pay nearterm debt maturities and fund our

facility and debt and equity issuances the following graph summarizes our aggregate debt maturities as of february 14 2014             1the debt maturing in 2015 assumes the exercise of a put option by the holders of our exchangeable senior debentures capital resources we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth including acquisitions as a result the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure our financial flexibility including our ability to incur debt make distributions and make investments is 56  contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of such indebtedness which include among other things the allowable amounts of leverage interest coverage and fixed charges during 2012 and 2013 we decreased our nearterm debt maturities expanded our borrowing capacity under our credit facility through a term loan and maintained compliance with our senior note and credit facility covenants if at any time we determine that market conditions are favorable after taking into account our liquidity requirements we may seek to issue and sell shares of host inc common stock in registered public offerings including through sales directly on the new york stock exchange under any future at the market offering program or to issue and sell shares of host inc preferred stock we also may seek to cause host lp to issue debentures exchangeable for shares of host inc common stock or senior notes given our total debt level and maturity schedule we will continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time taking advantage of favorable market conditions in october 2013 host incs board of directors authorized repurchases of up to 680 million of senior notes exchangeable debentures and mortgage debt other than in accordance with its terms of which 530 million remains available under this authority we may purchase senior notes and exchangeable debentures for cash through open market purchases privately negotiated transactions a tender offer or in some cases through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and ffo per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs accordingly in light of our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets we may at any time subject to applicable securities laws be considering or be in discussions with respect to the purchase or sale of common stock exchangeable debentures andor senior notes any such transactions may subject to applicable securities laws occur simultaneously we continue actively to explore potential acquisitions and anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from sales of properties but also potentially from equity offerings of host inc or by issuances of op units by host lp the incurrence of debt available cash or advances under our credit facility given the nature of these transactions we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review bid on or negotiate to purchase we may acquire additional properties through various structures including transactions involving single assets portfolios joint ventures and acquisitions of the securities or assets of other reits counterparty credit risk we are subject to counterparty credit risk which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential nonperformance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price we assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligation to determine the impact if any of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition we are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions access to our credit facility and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited our exposure with regard to our cash and the 779 million available under our credit facility is mitigated as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions at december 31 2013 the exposure risk related to our derivative contracts totaled 4 million and the counterparties were investment grade financial institutions sources and uses of cash our sources of cash include cash from operations proceeds from debt and equity issuances and proceeds from asset sales uses of cash during the year consisted of acquisitions investments in our joint ventures capital expenditures operating costs debt repayments and repurchases and distributions to equity holders we anticipate that our sources and uses of cash will be similar during 2014 cash provided by operations our cash provided by operations for 2013 increased 238 million to 1019 million compared to 2012 primarily due to improved operations at our hotels and a decrease in cash interest payments cash used in investing activities approximately 75 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2013 compared to 886 million in 2012 in addition to the acquisition investment and disposition activity detailed in the charts below we spent approximately 436 million on capital expenditures a decrease of 202 million from 2012 our renewal and replacement capital expenditures for 2013 were approximately 303 million which reflects a decrease of approximately 17 from 2012 levels our renewal and replacement capital expenditures generally are funded by the furniture fixture and equipment funds established at certain of our hotels typically 5 of property revenues and by our available cash we also spent approximately 133 million in 2013 on roiredevelopment projects and acquisition capital expenditures which reflects a decrease of approximately 51 compared to 2012 levels additionally we have capitalized certain internal costs and interest expense associated with our capital expenditure projects in accordance with gaap these capitalized costs were 11 million 11 million and 9 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively capital expenditures have totaled approximately 23 billion over the past five years and as a result we believe that our properties are in a strong competitive position

that were repaid in february 2014  senior notes the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issued by host lp to which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semiannually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above under the terms of our senior notes indenture our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of host lps unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host lp pledges and guarantees under the senior notes indenture all host lp subsidiaries which guarantee host lp debt are required to similarly guarantee debt issuances under the indenture also to the extent the equity of any subsidiaries of host lp are pledged to secure borrowings under the credit facility such collateral likewise is required to secure senior note issuances under the 61  senior notes indenture while the credit facility currently does not include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests such guarantees or pledges will be subsequently required in the event that host lps leverage ratio exceeds 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility as well as the senior notes issued under the senior notes indenture and certain hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility if triggered the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain us and canadian subsidiaries of host lp and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would not provide guarantees or pledges of equity interests further if at any time our leverage ratio falls below 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters or host lp has an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating such guarantees and pledges may be released series d senior notes restrictive covenants on march 28 2013 we completed an underwritten public offering of 400 million aggregate principal amount of series d senior notes bearing interest at a rate of 375 per year due in 2023 the series d senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the october 15 2023 maturity date except at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium as set forth in the senior notes indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date the notes were issued under our existing senior notes indenture and have covenants customary for investment grade debt primarily limitations on our ability to incur debt there are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends because these senior notes were issued after we attained an investment grade rating while all other series of our senior notes were issued before we had attained an investment grade rating the covenants are different than the covenants applicable to our other senior notes under the terms of the series d senior notes host lps ability to incur indebtedness is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions including the achievement of an ebitdatointerest coverage ratio of at least 15x by host lp as calculated this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on host lps consolidated statement of operations in addition the calculation is based on host lps pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to certain transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period other covenants limiting host lps ability to incur indebtedness include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65 of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values maintaining secured indebtedness of less than 40 of adjusted total assets and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150 of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured indebtedness of host lp and its subsidiaries so long as host lp maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture it may incur additional debt we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants applicable to our series d senior notes the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior

minimum ratio of 15x    prior series of senior notes restrictive covenantscurrently our senior notes have an investment grade rating from both moodys and standard amp poors as a result many of the restrictive covenants contained in the senior notes indenture and the supplemental indentures for our prior series of senior notes are not applicable as they do not apply for so long as such series of notes maintain an investment grade rating from both moodys and standard amp poors the following primary covenants continue to apply to our existing senior notes other than our series d senior notesrestrict our ability to sell all or substantially all assets or merge with or into other companies andrequire us to make an offer to repurchase the existing senior notes then currently outstanding upon the occurrence of a change of control62  if our senior notes no longer are rated investment grade by either or both of moodys and standard amp poors then the following covenants and other restrictions will be reinstated for our existing senior notes but will not apply to the series d senior notes which have different covenants our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions will be subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions including the achievement of an ebitdatointerest coverage ratio of at least 20x we will be able to make distributions to enable host inc to pay dividends on its preferred stock if any under the senior notes indenture when our ebitdatointerest coverage ratio is above 17 to 10 this ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture applicable to our existing senior notes based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value and during the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 15 million of noncash interest which represents expense recorded as a result of the implementation in 2009 of an accounting requirement relating to our outstanding exchangeable senior debentures these amounts are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operationsother covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions would include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65 of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values excluding intangible assets and maintaining secured indebtedness and subsidiary indebtedness of less than 45 of adjusted total assets so long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture applicable to our existing senior notes we may make preferred or common op unit distributions and incur additional debt including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and make distributions when our senior notes no longer are rated investment grade we still will be permitted to incur certain types of debt including i credit facility debt ii refinancing debt iii up to 400 million of mortgage debt which proceeds would be used to repay debt under the credit facility and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount and iv up to 150 million of other debt we also will be permitted to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain host incs reit statusa requirement to maintain unencumbered assets based on undepreciated book values of not less than 125 of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other debt not secured by mortgages this coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or make distributions discussed above which consequences where we fall below the coverage level are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or make distributions but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture andour ability to make distributions on redeem or repurchase our op units permit payment or distribution restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries sell assets enter into transactions with affiliates and create certain liens will be restrictedthe following summarizes the actual credit ratios for our existing senior notes other than the series d senior notes as of december 31 2013 and the covenant requirements contained in the senior notes indenture that would be applicable at such times as our existing senior notes no longer are rated investment grade by either of moodys or standard amp poors even if we were to lose the investment grade rating we would be in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the senior notes indenture                actual ratio

notes and our other senior notes our actual ratios as reported can be slightly different exchangeable debentures as of december 31 2013 we have 400 million of 2½ exchangeable senior debentures outstanding that were issued on december 22 2009 the 2009 debentures on march 28 2013 we converted 174 million of 3¼ debentures that were issued on march 16 2004 into 117 million shares of host inc common stock and redeemed the remaining 1 million for cash the 2009 debentures are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes holders have the right to require us to purchase the 2009 debentures at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest the put option on october 15 2015 and on certain other subsequent dates holders of the 2009 debentures also have the right to exchange the 2009 debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions including at any time at which the closing price of host incs common stock is more than 130 of the exchange price per share for at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the 63  calendar quarter or at any time up to two days prior to the date on which the 2009 debentures have been called for redemption we can redeem for cash all or part of the 2009 debentures at any time subsequent to october 20 2015 at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus accrued interest if at any time we elect to redeem the 2009 debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price we would expect the holders to elect to exchange the 2009 debentures at the respective exchange value rather than receive the cash redemption price the exchange value is equal to the applicable exchange rate multiplied by the price of host incs common stock upon exchange the 2009 debentures would be exchanged for host incs common stock cash or a combination thereof at our option as of december 31 2013 the closing price of host incs common stock exceeded 130 of the exchange price for more than 20 of 30 consecutive prior trading days therefore the 2009 debentures are exchangeable by holders through march 31 2014 whether the 2009 debentures continue to be exchangeable after march 31 2014 will depend on future trading prices of host incs common stock currently each 1000 debenture would be exchanged for 747034 host inc common shares for an equivalent per share price of 1339 for a total of 299 million shares we separately account for the liability and equity components of our 2009 debentures in order to reflect the fair value of the liability component based on our nonconvertible borrowing cost at the issuance date accordingly we record the liability components of the debentures at fair value as of the date of issuance and amortize the resulting discount as an increase to interest expense through the initial put option date of the 2009 debentures which is the expected life of the debt however there is no impact of this accounting treatment on our cash interest payments we measured the fair value of the debt components of the 2009 debentures at issuance based on an effective interest rate of 69 as a result we attributed 82 million of the proceeds received to the conversion feature of the 2009 debentures this amount represents the excess proceeds received over the fair value of the debt at the date of issuance and is included in host incs additional paidin capital and host lps partners capital on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2013 the debt carrying value and unamortized discount were 371 million and 29 million respectivelyinterest expense recorded for the 2009 debentures and our prior series of exchangeable debentures for the periods presented consists of the following in millions         year ended

administrative agent jpmorgan chase bank na as syndication agent wells fargo bank na deutsche bank ag new york branch and the bank of nova scotia as codocumentation agents and certain other agents and lenders the credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to 1 billion including a foreign currency subfacility for canadian dollars australian dollars new zealand dollars japanese yen euros and british pound sterling of up to the foreign currency equivalent of 500 million subject to a lower amount in the case of new zealand dollar borrowings the credit facility also provides a subfacility of up to 100 million for swingline borrowings and a subfacility of up to 100 million for issuances of letters of credit host lp also has the option to increase the aggregate principal amount of the credit facility by up to 500 million subject to obtaining additional loan commitments and satisfaction of certain conditions the credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of november 2015 with an option for host lp to extend the term for one additional year subject to certain conditions including the payment of an extension fee credit facility term loan on july 25 2012 we expanded the credit facility to add a new term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 500 million the term loan was established through an exercise of the option under the credit facility to increase the amount of the facility by up to 500 million we also amended the credit facility to allow us to retain the ability to exercise this option in the future for up to an additional 500 million of commitments subject to obtaining additional loan commitments and the satisfaction of the other conditions specified in the credit facility the term loan will mature in july 2017 the maturity date of the revolving loan commitments under the credit facility remains unchanged the term loan does not require any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity in 2013 and prior years we paid interest on the term loan at floating interest rates plus a margin ranging from 165 to 265 basis points depending on host lps consolidated leverage ratio on and after january 24 2014 the date on which host lp elected ratingsbased pricing we will pay interest on the term loan at floating rates plus a margin ranging from 115 to 200 basis points depending on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating based on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating at january 24 2014 the margin would be 145 basis points the term loan otherwise is subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees and pledges of security interests in subsidiaries operational covenants financial covenants and events of default as discussed below 64  collateral and guarantees the credit facility does not currently include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests in our subsidiaries or any other security and the guarantees and pledges are required only in the event that host lps leverage ratio exceeds 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility as well as the notes outstanding under host lps senior notes indenture interest rate and currency hedges and certain other hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility even when triggered the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain us and canadian subsidiaries of host lp and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would provide neither guarantees nor pledges of equity interests further if at any time our leverage ratio falls below 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters or host lp has an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating such guarantees and pledges may be released prepayments voluntary prepayments of the loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty the loans under the credit facility are required to be prepaid in the event that asset sales reduce adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values to below 10 billion if we do not reinvest the proceeds of those asset sales in new properties at december 31 2013 we have adjusted total assets as defined in our credit facility of 20 billion financial covenants  the credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 725x our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 175x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 125x the financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility hence so long as there are no amounts outstanding thereunder and the term loan is repaid we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the credit facility in the future if we were ever to regain compliance with the financial covenants these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period under the terms of the credit facility interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan to establish its fair value and noncash interest expense due to the implementation in 2009 of accounting standards relating to our exchangeable debentures all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations additionally total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a net debt concept under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of 100 million are deducted from our total debt balance we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility as of december 31 2013            covenant requirement       actual ratio   for all years   leverage ratio

is above 70x our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will be reduced to 15x interest and fees we pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to libor plus a margin in 2013 and prior years the margin ranged from 175 to 275 basis points depending on host lps consolidated leverage ratio on and after january 24 2014 the date on which host lp elected ratingsbased pricing the margin will range from 100 to 160 basis points depending on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating we also pay a facility fee ranging from 15 to 40 basis points depending on our rating and regardless of usage based on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating as of january 24 2014 we will be able to borrow at a rate of libor plus 125 basis points and pay a facility fee of 25 basis points other covenants and events of default the credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 60x as currently is the case in particular at any time that our leverage ratio is below 60x we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures and the limitations on acquisitions investments dividends and distributions contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture additionally the credit facilitys restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and distributions generally are consistent with our senior notes indenture these provisions under certain circumstances limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain host incs tax status as a reit the credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature and provides that upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated and the 65  lenders commitments may be terminated in addition upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default all amounts due under the credit facility will automatically become due and payable and the lenders commitments automatically will terminate mortgage and other debt as of december 31 2013 we had 12 hotels that were secured by mortgage debt however we expect to pay the 300 million mortgage debt on two of our properties that matures on march 1 2014 subsequent to the repayment revenues from the secured properties accounted for 3 of our total revenues in 2013 substantially all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except in instances of fraud misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions as of december 31 2013 secured debt represented approximately 15 of our total debt and our aggregate secured debt had an average interest rate of 41 and an average

accounted for under the equity method the portion of the mortgage and other debt of these partnerships and joint ventures attributable to us based on our percentage of ownership thereof was 500 million at december 31 2013 this debt balance primarily is attributable to our approximate onethird ownership interest in the euro jv the mortgage debt related to the hotels owned by our euro jv
