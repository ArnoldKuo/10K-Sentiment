1business host inc was incorporated as a maryland corporation in 1998 and operates as a selfmanaged and selfadministered reit host inc owns properties and conducts operations through host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and in which it holds approximately 987 of the partnership interests op units as of december 31 2013 the remaining partnership interests are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lps daytoday management and control as of february 14 2014 our consolidated lodging portfolio consists of 114 primarily luxury and upperupscale hotels containing approximately 60000 rooms with the majority located in the united states and with 15 of the properties located outside of the us in canada new zealand chile australia mexico and brazil we also are developing two hotels in rio de janeiro brazil in addition we own noncontrolling interests in two international joint ventures a joint venture in europe which owns 19 luxury and upper upscale hotels with approximately 6400 rooms in france italy spain the netherlands the united kingdom belgium poland germany and sweden and a joint venture in asiapacific which owns one upscale hotel in australia and minority interests in two operating hotels one upscale and one midscale in india and five additional hotels in india currently under development we also hold noncontrolling investments in the 255room hyatt place nashville downtown in tennessee a 131unit vacation ownership project under development adjacent to our hyatt regency maui resort amp spa and the philadelphia marriott downtown in which we sold an 89 ownership interest in january 2014 the lodging industry the lodging industry in the united states consists of private and public entities that operate in an extremely diversified market under a variety of brand names the lodging industry has several key participants ownersown the hotel and typically enter into an agreement for an independent third party to manage the hotel these properties may be branded and operated under the managers brand or branded under a franchise agreement and operated by the franchisee or by an independent hotel manager the properties also may be operated as an independent hotel by an independent hotel manager ownermanagersown the hotel and operate the property with their own management team these properties may be branded under a franchise agreement operated as an independent hotel or operated under the owners brand we are prohibited from operating and managing hotels under applicable reit rules 1  franchisorsown a brand or brands and strive to grow their revenues by expanding the number of hotels in their franchise system franchisors provide their hotels with brand recognition marketing support and centralized reservation systems for the franchised hotels franchisormanagersown a brand or brands and also operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner or franchisee managersoperate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner but do not themselves own a brand the hotels may be operated under a franchise agreement or as an independent hotel the hotel manager is responsible for the daytoday operation of the hotel including the employment of hotel staff the determination of room rates the development of sales and marketing plans the preparation of operating and capital expenditure budgets and the preparation of financial reports for the owner they typically receive fees based on the revenues and profitability of the hotel the lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different segments each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs luxury upper upscale upscale midscale with and without food and beverage service and economy our portfolio primarily consists of luxury and upper upscale properties that are located in the central business districts of major cities near airports and resortconference destinations which are operated under internationally recognized brand names such as marriott hyatt starwood and accor see  our hotel portfolio revenues earned at our hotels consist of three broad categories rooms food and beverage and other revenues while approximately 65 of our revenue is generated from room sales many of our properties feature a variety of amenities that help drive demand and profitability our hotels typically include meeting and banquet facilities a variety of restaurants and lounges swimming pools exercise facilities andor spas gift shops and parking facilities the combination of which enable them to serve business leisure and group travelers the following graphs summarize the composition of the 114 hotels in our consolidated portfolio based on the percentage of revenues represented by our luxury upper upscale and other categories and by property type   2  our industry is influenced by the cyclical relationship between the supply of and demand for hotel rooms lodging demand growth typically is related to the vitality of the overall economy in addition to local market factors that stimulate travel to specific destinations in particular economic indicators such as gdp growth business investment and employment growth are some of the primary drivers of lodging demand the global recession of 2008 and 2009 resulted in a considerable decline both in consumer and business spending and a severe decline in demand within the lodging industry beginning in 2010 as economic conditions gradually have stabilized and strengthened lodging demand has improved steadily driven by moderate gdp growth in the us coupled with increasing business investment the primary demand driver has been transient demand from business and leisure travelers and to a much lesser degree group business we expect demand to continue to improve in 2014 as the potential for growth in group business and expected continued growth in transient business could lead to further revpar improvements however several economic headwinds may hamper lodging demand including the expected tapering of the us federal reserve bondbuying program known as quantitative easing the tenuous nature of the euro zone recovery the slowdown in growth in china and general instability in emerging markets lodging supply growth generally is driven by overall lodging demand as extended periods of strong demand growth tend to encourage new development however the rate of supply growth also is influenced by a number of additional factors including the availability of capital interest rates construction costs and unique market considerations the relatively long leadtime required to complete the development of hotels makes supply growth easier to forecast than demand growth but increases the volatility of the cyclical behavior of the lodging industry as illustrated in the charts below for the us lodging industry at different points in the cycle demand may increase when there is no new supply or supply may grow when demand is declining the decline in lodging demand during the recession of 2008 through 2009 and the lack of available financing for new hotel construction caused a significant reduction in hotel development as a result supply growth was relatively low in 2010 through 2013 overall we expect domestic supply growth to remain constrained in 2014 at approximately 15 which still is below the historical average of approximately 2 additionally we believe that the average supply growth for upper upscale hotels in our markets will be approximately 09 in 2014 however new york city and washington dc are expected to experience above average growth in supply which will increase competition in these markets we anticipate that demand growth will exceed supply growth in the near term resulting in continued growth in revenue per available room revpar which is consistent with analysis prepared by pkf hospitality research revpar is a commonly used operational measure of hotel performance in the lodging industry calculated as the product of average room rate and occupancy percentage occupancy levels in the upperupscale market currently are above their 15year average therefore while there is potential for occupancy growth we believe revpar growth primarily will be driven by increases in average room rate however there can be no assurance that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties or improvement in margins will continue for any number of reasons including those discussed above 3  our portfolio primarily consists of upper upscale hotels and accordingly its performance is best understood in comparison to the upper upscale segment rather than the entire industry the charts below detail the historical supply demand and revpar growth for the us lodging industry and for the us upper upscale segment for 2009 to 2013 and forecast data for 2014 us lodging industry supply demand and revpar growth us upper upscale supply demand and revpar growth   business strategy our primary longterm business objective is to provide superior total returns to our equity holders through a combination of appreciation in asset values growth in earnings and dividend distributions to achieve this objective we seek to drive operating results at our properties through aggressive asset management acquire properties in urban and resortconference destinations we will continue to focus on target markets in gateway domestic cities such as new york washington dc boston miami chicago los angeles san francisco san diego seattle and hawaii and international cities such as london paris munich berlin madrid barcelona stockholm 4  sydney tokyo rio de janeiro são paulo and mexico city which we believe have strong demand generators that appeal to multiple customer segments and have high barriers to entry that limit new supply while our focus will remain primarily on luxury and upper upscale properties we will remain opportunistic and may acquire or develop hotels in other lodging segments or markets wherever possible match each property with the appropriate manager and brand affiliation for the majority of our portfolio we seek properties that are franchised or operated by leading management companies as we believe their widespread brand recognition and brand loyalty programs can maximize demand we will also look for opportunities to enhance flexibility in our management agreements which can increase the market value of the property strategically invest in major redevelopment and return on investment roi projects in order to maximize the inherent value in our portfolio maintain a strong balance sheet with a low leverage level and balanced debt maturities in order to minimize our cost of capital and to maximize our financial flexibility in order to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging cycle expand our global portfolio holdings and revenue sources through joint ventures or direct acquisitions that diversify our investments and recycle capital through the disposition of assets to better align our portfolio within our target gateway markets we also may opportunistically dispose of hotels to take advantage of market conditions or in situations where the hotels are at a competitive risk since 2002 the percentage of revenues from our target markets in the us and internationally has increased from approximately 55 to 75 the following graph summarizes the composition of our consolidated hotels by market based on percentage of revenues which excludes properties owned by our european and asiapacific joint ventures  acquisitions and development our acquisition strategy focuses on acquiring hotels at attractive yields that exceed our cost of capital in our target markets as discussed above these markets consist of gateway cities in the us and in key international cities that are positioned to attract premium corporate leisure and international travelers and have significant barriers to entry based on historical trends we believe these markets will have favorable longterm supply and demand dynamics and consequently better potential for revenue growth in the us we will focus primarily on acquiring upper upscale and luxury hotels at prices below replacement cost and secondarily developing midscale and upscale hotels with strategic partners in target markets our efforts in europe will include the acquisition of upper upscale and luxury hotels in our target markets through our european joint venture in the 5  asiapacific and latin america regions we will concentrate both on the acquisition of upper upscale and luxury hotels and the development of midscale and upscale hotels in our target markets which we may look to acquire directly or through joint ventures with strategic partners we may acquire additional properties through various structures including transactions involving single assets portfolios joint ventures and acquisitions of the securities or assets of other reits value enhancement initiatives we look to enhance the value of our portfolio by identifying and executing strategies designed to achieve the highest and best use of our properties these projects have included the development of timeshare office space or condominium units on excess land redevelopment or expansion of existing retail space the purchase or extension of ground leases the acquisition of air rights or development entitlements or the restructuring of management agreements we believe that the successful execution of these projects will create significant value for the company redevelopment and return on investment projects we pursue opportunities to enhance asset value by completing select capital improvements outside the scope of recurring renewal and replacement capital expenditures these projects are designed to take advantage of changing market conditions and the favorable location of our properties to increase profitability and enhance customer satisfaction we also evaluate our capital expenditures projects based on their environmental impact in collaboration with our hotel managers we evaluate new products and systems designed to optimize energy performance and reduce water consumption many of these sustainability projects include the renewal and replacement of systems and equipment reaching the end of its life cycle with more efficient solutions and incorporating sustainable materials and construction practices within renovation projects we also invest in building infrastructure projects that mitigate potential risks associated with extreme weather events or climate change our capital expenditures projects generally fall into the following categories redevelopment projects these projects are designed to optimally position our hotels within their markets and competitive set redevelopment projects include extensive renovations of guest rooms including bathrooms lobbies food and beverage outlets expanding ballroom and meeting rooms and major mechanical system upgrades targeted return on investment projects these roi projects often are smaller and focused on specific areas such as converting unprofitable or underutilized space into meeting space adding guestrooms or implementing a building automation system acquisition capital expenditures projects in connection with the acquisition of a property we prepare capital and operational improvement plans designed to improve profitability and enhance the guest experience these projects may include required renewal and replacement projects significant redevelopment and even rebranding of the property and represent a key component of our decision to invest in a hotel and typically are completed within two to three years of acquisition renewal and replacement capital expenditures we work closely with our managers to ensure that renewal and replacement capital expenditures are spent efficiently in order to maximize the profitability of the hotel while minimizing disruption to operations typically room renovations occur at intervals of approximately seven years but the timing may vary based on the type of property and equipment being replaced these refurbishments generally are divided into the following types soft goods case goods bathroom and infrastructure soft goods include items such as carpeting bed spreads curtains and wall vinyl and may require more frequent updates in order to maintain brand quality standards case goods include items such as dressers desks couches restaurant and meeting room chairs and tables and generally are not replaced as frequently bathroom renovations include the replacement of tile vanity lighting and plumbing fixtures infrastructure includes the physical plant of the hotel including the roof elevators façade and fire systems asset management as the owner of a diverse portfolio of properties we are in a unique position to work with our managers to maximize revenues while minimizing operating costs the size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading operators and brands in the industry allow us to benchmark similar hotels and identify best practices and efficiencies that can improve the longterm profitability of our hotels by driving group business which allows our operators to shift the mix of business to the higherrated transient segments we also carefully evaluate our management and franchise agreements prior to the acquisition of a new hotel or upon termination of an existing contract this may include obtaining franchise rights for hotels and hiring an independent operator to manage the hotel which may be more efficient for some hotels while still maintaining the brand recognition of the existing manager see operational agreements for further discussion capital structure and liquidity profile in order to maintain its qualification as a reit host inc is required to distribute 90 of its taxable income other than net capital gain to its stockholders and as a result generally relies on external sources of capital as well as cash from operations to finance growth we use a variety of debt and equity instruments to fund our external growth including senior notes and mortgage debt exchangeable debentures common and preferred stock offerings issuances of op units and joint ventureslimited partnerships to take advantage of the prevailing market conditions while we may issue debt at any time management believes it is prudent over time to target a leverage ratio of approximately 30x debttoebitda we believe that lower leverage reduces our overall cost of capital and our earnings volatility and increases our access to capital thereby providing us with 6  the necessary flexibility to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging cycle which we consider a key competitive advantage we also seek to structure our debt profile to allow us to access different forms of financing primarily senior notes and exchangeable debentures as well as mortgage debt particularly outside of the us when debt is priced reasonably and can be denominated in the local currency generally this means we look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt minimize nearterm maturities and maintain a balanced maturity schedule joint ventures we expect to continue to utilize joint ventures to finance external growth we believe joint ventures provide a significant means to access external capital and spread the inherent risk of hotel ownership our primary focus for joint ventures is in international markets which helps to diversify exposure to market risk dispositions our disposition strategy is aligned with our overall portfolio focus to reallocate our investments to target gateway markets generally our dispositions will be focused on secondary or tertiary markets or as part of our strategy to limit our total investment within individual markets we may dispose of assets in our target markets through direct sales or through the creation of joint ventures when we have the opportunity to capitalize on value enhancement strategies and apply the proceeds to other business objectives additionally we will dispose of properties where we believe the potential for growth is constrained or on properties with significant capital expenditure requirements where we do not believe we would generate a significant return on the investment proceeds from dispositions are deployed to repay debt or fund acquisitions and roiredevelopment projects corporate responsibility hosts corporate responsibility strategy integrates fiscal environmental and social elements at both the corporate and portfolio levels our corporate responsibility program focuses on the following themes and objectives responsible investment invest in proven sustainability practices that create and drive valueenvironmental stewardship monitor and improve the resource efficiency and environmental footprint of our properties and corporate citizenship strengthen local communities through financial support community engagement and volunteer service management and governance our corporate responsibility program is managed by our corporate responsibility team and governed by the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors operating structure host inc operates through an umbrella partnership structure in which substantially all of its assets are held by host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and holds approximately 987 of the op units as of december 31 2013 a reit is a corporation that has elected to be treated as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code and that meets certain ownership organizational and operating requirements set forth under the code in general through payments of dividends to stockholders a reit is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level each op unit owned by holders other than host inc is redeemable at the option of the holder for an amount of cash equal to the market value of one share of host inc common stock multiplied by a factor of 1021494 rather than a conversion factor of 1 shareop unit that existed prior to the december 2009 stock dividend host inc has the right to acquire any op unit offered for redemption directly from the holder in exchange for 1021494 shares of host inc common stock instead of host lp redeeming such op unit for cash additionally for every share of common stock issued by host inc host lp will issue 97895 op units to host inc as of december 31 2013 noncontrolling limited partners held 95 million op units which were convertible into 97 million host inc common shares assuming that all op units held by noncontrolling limited partners were converted into common shares there would have been 7645 million common shares of host inc outstanding at december 31 2013 7  our operating structure is as follows  because host inc has elected to be treated as a reit certain tax laws limit the amount of nonqualifying income that host inc and host lp can earn including income derived directly from the operation of hotels as a result we lease substantially all of our consolidated properties to certain of our subsidiaries designated as taxable reit subsidiaries trs for federal income tax purposes or to third party lessees our trs are subject to income tax and are not limited as to the amount of nonqualifying income they can generate our trs enter into agreements with third parties to manage the operations of the hotels our trs also may own assets engaging in other activities that produce nonqualifying income such as the development of timeshare or condominium units subject to certain restrictions the difference between the hotels net operating cash flow and the aggregate rents paid to host lp is retained by our trs as taxable income accordingly the net effect of the trs leases is that while as a reit host inc generally is exempt from federal income tax to the extent that it meets specific distribution requirements among other reit requirements a portion of the net operating cash flow from our properties is subject to federal state and if applicable foreign income tax our hotel portfolio as of february 14 2014 we owned a portfolio of 114 hotel properties of which 99 are located in the united states and 15 are located in australia brazil canada chile mexico and new zealand our consolidated hotels located outside the united states collectively contain approximately 3826 rooms approximately 5 of our revenues were attributed to the operations of these foreign properties in each of 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we also are developing two hotel properties in brazilour consolidated hotels primarily consist of luxury and upper upscale properties all of our hotels generally are located in the central business districts of major cities near airports or in resortconference destinations that because of their locations typically benefit from barriers to entry for new supply thirtynine of our owned hotels representing approximately 63 of our revenues have in excess of 500 rooms the average age of our properties is 30 years although substantially all of the properties have benefited from significant renovations or major additions as well as regularly scheduled renewal and replacement and other capital improvements 8  by brand the following table details our consolidated hotel portfolio by brand as of february

january 10 2014 sale of an 89 interest in the property based on a market value of 303 million the property is subject to a mortgage loan of 230 millioncompetition the lodging industry is highly competitive competition often is specific to individual markets and is based on a number of factors including location brand guest facilities and amenities level of service room rates and the quality of accommodations the lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different segments each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs luxury upper upscale upscale midscale with and without food and beverage service and economy the classification of a property is based on lodging industry standards which take into consideration many factors such as guest facilities and amenities level of service and quality of accommodations most of our hotels operate in urban and resort markets either as luxury properties under such brand names as fairmont four seasons grand hyatt jw marriott ritzcarlton st regis the luxury collection and w or as upper upscale properties under such brand names as embassy suites hilton hyatt le méridien marriott executive apartments marriott marquis marriott suites pullman renaissance sheraton swissôtel and westin we also may selectively invest in upscale and midscale properties such as courtyard by marriott crowne plaza four points by sheraton hyatt place ibis novotel or residence inn by marriott particularly in international markets1 while our hotels primarily compete with other hotels in the luxury and upper upscale segments they also may compete with hotels in other lowertier segments in addition many management contracts for our hotels do not prohibit our managers from converting franchising or developing other hotel properties in our markets as a result our hotels compete with other hotels that our managers may own invest in manage or franchise we believe our properties enjoy competitive advantages associated with the hotel brands under which they operate the international marketing programs and reservation systems of these brands combined with the strong management systems and expertise they provide should enable our properties to perform favorably in terms of both occupancy and room rates in addition repeat guest business is enhanced by guest reward or guest recognition programs offered by most of these brands 1 this annual report contains registered trademarks that are the exclusive property of their respective owners which are companies other than us none of the owners of these trademarks their affiliates or any of their respective officers directors agents or employees has or will have any responsibility or liability for any information contained in this annual report12  we also compete with other reits and other public and private investors for the acquisition of new properties and investment opportunities both in domestic and international markets as we attempt to position our portfolio to take best advantage of changes in markets and travel patterns of our customers seasonality our hotel sales traditionally have experienced moderate seasonality which varies based on the individual property and the region hotel sales for our consolidated portfolio averaged approximately 24 27 23 and 26 for the first second third and fourth calendar quarters respectively in 2013 environmental and regulatory matters under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances these laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances in addition certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of hazardous or toxic materials and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released hazardous or toxic materials environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated and these restrictions may require corrective or other expenditures in connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels we potentially may be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities although currently we are not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us we can offer no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future operational agreements all of our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements with some of such hotels also subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operation under the designated brand under these agreements the managers generally have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the daytoday operation of the hotels including establishing room rates securing and processing reservations procuring inventories supplies and services providing periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers technical and operational experts and promoting and publicizing the hotels the managers provide all managerial and other employees for the hotels review the operation and maintenance of the hotels prepare reports budgets and projections and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels these support services include planning and policy services divisional financial services product planning and development employee staffing and training corporate executive management and certain inhouse legal services we have certain approval rights over budgets capital expenditures significant leases and contractual commitments and various other matters general terms and provisions  agreements governing the management and operation of our hotels typically include the terms described below term and fees for operational services the initial term of our management and operating agreements generally is 15 to 25 years with one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager the majority of our management agreements condition the managers right to exercise options for specified renewal terms upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria the manager typically receives compensation in the form of a base management fee which is calculated as a percentage generally 23 of annual gross revenues and an incentive management fee which typically is calculated as a percentage generally 1020 of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the hotel in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the base management fee is only 1 of annual gross revenues but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable to starwood under a separate license agreement as described below license services in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the operation of the hotels is subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to the designated brand including rights to use trademarks service marks and logos matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services although the term of these license agreements with starwood generally is coterminous with the corresponding operating agreements the license agreements contemplate the potential for continued brand affiliation even in the event of a termination of the operating agreement as noted above the starwood licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees generally 5 of gross revenues attributable to room sales and 2 of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales which amounts supplement the lower base management fee of 1 of gross revenues received by starwood under the operating agreements chain or system programs and services managers are required to provide chain or system programs and services generally that are furnished on a centralized basis such services include the development and operation of certain computer systems 13  and reservation services regional or other centralized management and administrative services marketing and sales programs and services training and other personnel services and other centralized or regional services as may be determined to be more efficiently performed on a centralized regional or group basis rather than on an individual hotel basis costs and expenses incurred in providing these chain or system programs and services generally are allocated on a cost reimbursement basis among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates or that otherwise benefit from these services working capital and fixed asset supplies we are required to maintain working capital for each hotel and to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies for example linen china glassware silver and uniforms we also are responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds available from working capital are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels for certain hotels the working capital accounts which would otherwise be maintained by the managers for each of such hotels are maintained on a pooled basis with managers being authorized to make withdrawals from such pooled account as otherwise contemplated with respect to working capital in accordance with the provisions of the management or operating agreements furniture fixtures and equipment replacements we are required to provide the managers with all furniture fixtures and equipment ffampe necessary for the operation of the hotels including funding any required ffampe replacements on an annual basis the managers prepare budgets for ffampe to be acquired and certain routine repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the necessary funds which budgets are subject to our review and approval for purposes of funding such expenditures a specified percentage typically 5 of the gross revenues of each hotel is deposited by the manager into an escrow or reserve account in our name to which the manager has access in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels our operating agreements contemplate that this reserve account also may be used to fund the cost of certain major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building as described below for certain of our marriottmanaged hotels we have entered into an agreement with marriott to allow for such expenditures to be funded from one pooled reserve account rather than funds being deposited into separate reserve accounts at each hotel with the minimum required balance maintained on an ongoing basis in that pooled reserve account being significantly below the amount that otherwise would have been maintained in such separate hotel reserve accounts for certain of our starwoodmanaged hotels the periodic reserve fund contributions which otherwise would be deposited into reserve accounts maintained by managers for each hotel are distributed to us and as to this pool of hotels we are responsible for providing funding of expenditures which otherwise would be funded from reserve accounts for each of the subject hotels building alterations improvements and renewals the managers are required to prepare an annual estimate of the expenditures necessary for major repairs alterations improvements renewals and replacements to the structural mechanical electrical heating ventilating air conditioning plumbing and elevators of each hotel along with alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required in the managers reasonable judgment to keep the hotel in a competitive efficient and economical operating condition that is consistent with brand standards we generally have approval rights as to such budgets and expenditures which we review and approve based on our managers recommendations and on our judgment expenditures for these major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building typically are funded directly by owners although as noted above our agreements with starwood contemplate that certain such expenditures may be funded from the reserve account treatment of additional owner funding as additional owner funding becomes necessary either for expenditures generally funded from the ffampe replacement funds or for any major repairs or improvements to the hotel building which may be required to be funded directly by owners most of our agreements provide for an economic benefit to us through an impact on the calculation of incentive management fees payable to our managers one approach frequently utilized at our marriottmanaged hotels is to provide such owner funding through loans which are repaid with interest from operational revenues with the repayment amounts reducing operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees another approach that is used at our starwoodmanaged hotels as well as with certain expenditures projects at our marriottmanaged hotels is to treat such owner funding as an increase to our investment in the hotel resulting in an increase to owners priority return with a corresponding reduction to the amount of operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees for our starwoodmanaged hotels that are subject to the pooled arrangement described above the amount of any additional reserve account funding is allocated to each of such hotels on a pro rata basis determined with reference to the net operating income of each hotel and the total net operating income of all such pooled hotels for the most recent operating year territorial protections certain management and operating agreements impose restrictions for a specified period which limit the manager and its affiliates from owning operating or licensing a hotel of the same brand within a specified area the area restrictions vary with each hotel from city blocks in urban areas to up to a multimile radius from the hotel in other areas sale of the hotel subject to specific agreements as to certain hotels see below under special termination rights we generally are limited in our ability to sell lease or otherwise transfer the hotels by the requirement that the transferee assume the related management agreements and meet specified other conditions including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the manager 14  performance termination rights in addition to any right to terminate that may arise as a result of a default by the manager most of our management and operating agreements include reserved rights by us to terminate management or operating agreements on the basis of the managers failure to meet certain performancebased metrics typically including a specified threshold return on owners investment in the hotel along with a failure of the hotel to achieve a specified revpar performance threshold established with reference to other competitive hotels in the market typically such performancebased termination rights arise in the event the operator fails to achieve specified performance thresholds over a consecutive twoyear period and are subject to the managers ability to cure and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts or in some instances waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees we have agreed in the past and may agree in the future to waive certain of these termination rights in exchange for consideration from a manager or its affiliates which consideration may include cash compensation or amendments to management agreements special termination rights in addition to any performancebased or other termination rights set forth in our management and operating agreements we have specific negotiated termination rights as to certain management and operating agreements with respect to our marriott portfolio subject to certain timing and other limitations these rights include termination rights applicable to 16 properties with respect to our starwood portfolio subject to certain timing and other limitations these rights include termination rights applicable to 8 properties we also have similar termination rights applicable to 8 other properties while the brand affiliation of a property may increase the value of a hotel the ability to dispose of a property unencumbered by a management agreement or even brand affiliation also can increase the value for prospective purchasers these termination rights can take a number of different forms including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation as well as termination without sale or other condition which may require payment of a fee these termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by ebitda require that a certain number of properties continue to maintain the brand affiliation or be restricted to a specific pool of assets employees as of december 31 2013 we had 242 employees of which 218 work in the united states we had 24 employees located in our offices in london rio de janeiro amsterdam and singapore none of hosts employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements other than those working in our office in rio de janeiro the number of employees referenced above does not include the hotel employees of our nine hotels in brazil new zealand and australia which while technically are host employees are under the direct supervision and control of our thirdparty hotel managers our thirdparty managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels although we do not manage employees at our consolidated hotels we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force particularly those hotels with unionized labor we believe relations with the employees of these third party managers are positive for a discussion of these relationships see part i item 1a risk factorswe are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor employees at certain of our thirdparty managed hotels are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to review and renewal on a regular basis for a discussion of these relationships see part i item 1a risk factorswe are subject to risks associated with the employment of

describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 financial risks and risks of operation our revenues and the value of our properties are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry the lodging industry is subject to changes in the travel patterns of business and leisure travelers both of which are affected by the strength of the economy as well as other factors the performance of the lodging industry has traditionally been closely linked with the performance of the general economy and specifically growth in gross domestic product gdp changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers particularly during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth may create difficulties for the industry over the longterm and adversely affect our results the majority of our hotels are classified as luxury or upper upscale in an economic downturn these types of hotels may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenue as compared to hotels in other categories that have lower room rates this characteristic may result from the fact that these hotels generally target business and highend leisure travelers in periods of economic difficulties business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel or seeking to reduce costs on their trips during the recession in 2008 and 2009 overall travel was reduced which had a significant effect on our results of operations while operating results have improved since then there continues to be uncertainty in the overall strength of the recovery in the united states europe and other parts of the world additionally continued high unemployment has slowed the pace of the economic recovery therefore there can be no assurance that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons including but not limited to slower than anticipated growth in the economy our results of operations and any forecast we make may be affected by and can change based on a variety of circumstances that affect the lodging industry including changes in the international national regional and local economic climate changes in business and leisure travel patterns the effect of terrorist attacks and terror alerts in the united states and internationally as well as other geopolitical disturbances supply growth in markets where we own hotels which may adversely affect demand at our properties the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers relative to competing hotels the performance of the managers of our hotels outbreaks of disease and the impact on travel of natural disasters and weather physical damage to our hotels as a result of earthquakes hurricanes or other natural disasters or the income lost as a result of the damagechanges in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors and unionization of the labor force at our hotels a reduction in our revenue or earnings as a result of the above risks may reduce our working capital impact our longterm business strategy and impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet certain covenants in our existing debt agreements in addition continued political uncertainty and changes in government policies in particular with respect to u s economic policy federal budget deficit concerns and the slowdown in the federal reserves bond buying program could have material adverse impacts on financial markets and economic conditions in the united states and throughout the world this in turn could directly or indirectly adversely affect lodging demand and therefore our business and financial condition in addition us government travel is approximately 5 of our business and may suffer as a result of us federal spending cuts resulting from regulations reducing the amount of travel by us government employees and contractors in 2013 we experienced weakened government demand for our hotel rooms in some markets such as washington dc which may continue depending on factors such as the outcome of us federal budget negotiations16  disruptions in the financial markets may affect adversely our business and results of operations our ability to obtain financing on reasonable and acceptable terms and our ability to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk the united states and global equity and credit markets have experienced and may in the future experience significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions this may cause the market price of the stock of many companies to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective and outstanding debt financings to widen considerably in the event these disruptions occur liquidity in the financial markets will be affected which may make terms for financings less attractive and in some cases result in the lack of availability of certain types of financing uncertainty regarding the stability of the equity and credit markets may impact negatively our ability to access additional shortterm and longterm financing on reasonable terms or at all which would impact negatively our liquidity and financial condition a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may impact negatively our ability to enter into derivative contracts in order to hedge risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity with which to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital debt service and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future if our operating results weaken significantly and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or if interest rates increase significantly we could face liquidity problems that could affect materially and adversely our results of operations and financial condition economic conditions may affect adversely the value of our hotels which may result in impairment charges on our properties we analyze our assets for impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable for example we analyze our assets for impairments when a property has current or projected losses from operations when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when other material trends contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred such that an assets carrying value may not be recoverable for impaired assets we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the propertys carrying value over its fair value we may incur additional impairment charges in the future which charges will affect negatively our results of operations we can provide no assurance that any impairment loss recognized would not be material to our results of operations for information on impairment charges taken in 2013 and 2012 see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies we depend on external sources of capital for future growth and we may be unable to access capital when necessaryunlike regular c corporations host inc must finance its growth and fund debt repayments largely with external sources of capital because it is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of its taxable income other than net capital gain in order to qualify as a reit including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which it does not receive cash funds used by host inc to make required distributions are provided through distributions from host lp our ability to access external capital could be hampered by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control including credit market conditions as discussed above unfavorable market perception of our growth potential decreases in our current and estimated future earnings or decreases in the market price of the common stock of host inc our ability to access additional capital also may be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness which under certain circumstances restrict our incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and host lp distributions the occurrence of any of these factors individually or in combination could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our future growth we have substantial debt and may incur additional debt as of december 31 2013 we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately 48 billion our substantial indebtedness requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures expansion efforts dividends and distributions and other general corporate needs additionally our substantial indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or to obtain financing for expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate needs on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all or affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions if our cash flow and working capital are not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness we will be required to raise additional funds through sales of host lps op units or host incs common stock the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by host lp or 17  the sale of our assets we cannot make any assurances that any of these sources of funds will be available to us or if available will be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient to meet our obligations or fulfill our business plan under certain circumstances we would be required to use the cash from some of the events described above to repay other indebtedness the terms of our debt place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and these restrictions reduce our operational flexibility and create default risks the documents governing the terms of our senior notes and our credit facility contain covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries these covenants restrict among other things our ability to conduct acquisitions mergers or consolidations unless the successor entity in such transaction assumes our indebtedness incur additional debt in excess of certain thresholds and without satisfying certain financial metrics create liens securing indebtedness unless an effective provision is made to secure our other indebtedness by such liens sell assets without using the proceeds from such sales for certain permitted uses or to make an offer to repay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness make distributions without satisfying certain financial metrics and conduct transactions with affiliates other than on an arms length basis and in certain instances without obtaining opinions as to the fairness of such transactions in addition certain covenants in our credit facility also require us and our subsidiaries to meet financial performance tests the restrictive covenants in the applicable indentures the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt including our mortgage debt will reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt in addition certain of our mortgage debt requires that to the extent cash flow from the hotels which secure such debt drops below stated levels we escrow cash flow after the payment of debt service until operations improve above the stated levels in some cases the lender may apply the escrowed amount to the outstanding balance of the mortgage debt if such provisions are triggered the amounts required to be escrowed may affect negatively our liquidity from these mortgaged properties by limiting our access to cash flow after debt service for a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition our ability to pay dividends and to make distributions may be limited or prohibited by the terms of our indebtedness or preferred units we are and may in the future become party to agreements and instruments that restrict or prevent the payment of dividends on classes and series of host inc capital stock and host lps payment of distributions on its classes of units under the terms of host lps credit facility distributions to host lp unitholders including host inc upon which host inc depends in order to obtain the cash necessary to pay dividends are permitted only to the extent that host lp can satisfy certain financial covenant tests concerning leverage fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage and meet other requirements we also will be subject to similar restrictions under the terms of our senior notes if our senior notes are no longer rated investment grade we are however permitted under our credit facility and senior notes indenture to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain host incs reit status under the terms of host lps outstanding preferred op units we are not permitted to make distributions on our common op units unless all cumulative distributions have been paid or funds for payment have been set aside for payment on our preferred op units in the event that we fail to pay the accrued distributions on our preferred op units for any reason including any restriction on making such distributions under the terms of our debt instruments as discussed above distributions will continue to accrue on such preferred op units and we will be prohibited from making any distributions on our common op units until all such accrued but unpaid distributions on our preferred op units have been paid or funds for such payment have been set aside an increase in interest rates would increase the interest costs on our credit facility and on our floating rate debt and could impact adversely our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets interest payments for borrowings on our credit facility the mortgages on certain properties and fixedtofloating interest rate swaps linked to two other properties are based on floating rates as a result an increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes including investments in our portfolio further rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures and increase interest costs on any debt that is refinanced we may from time to time enter into 18  agreements such as interest rate swaps caps floors and other interest rate hedging contracts currently the majority of our mortgages with floating rates are fully or partially hedged through the use of floatingtofixed interest rate swaps or interest rate caps and floors while these agreements may lessen the impact of rising interest rates they also expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to dispose of assets as part of our business strategy rating agency downgrades may increase our cost of capitalour senior notes are rated by moodys investors service standard amp poors ratings services and fitch ratings these independent rating agencies may elect to downgrade their ratings on our senior notes at any time such downgrades may affect negatively our access to the capital markets and increase our cost of capital our expenses may not decrease if our revenue decreases many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels such as debtservice payments property taxes insurance utilities and employee wages and benefits are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in revenue at the hotels our expenses also will be affected by inflationary increases and certain costs such as wages benefits and insurance may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period in the event of a significant decrease in demand our hotel managers may not be able to reduce the size of hotel work forces in order to decrease wages and benefits our managers also may be unable to offset any such increased expenses with higher room rates any of our efforts to reduce operating costs or failure to make scheduled capital expenditures also could adversely affect the future growth of our business and the value of our hotel properties our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations as part of our business strategy we seek primarily to acquire luxury and upper upscale hotel properties we may acquire properties through various structures including transactions involving portfolios single assets joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits or similar real estate entities we anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods including proceeds from host inc equity offerings issuance of limited partnership interests of host lp advances under our credit facility the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness and proceeds from the sales of assets to the extent there are disruptions in credit markets it may limit our ability to finance acquisitions and may limit the ability of purchasers to finance hotels and therefore our ability to use disposition proceeds to finance acquisitions we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions we may not achieve the value we anticipate from new hotel developments or value enhancement projects at our existing hotelswe currently are and in the future may be involved in the development of hotel properties timeshare units or other alternate uses of portions of our existing properties including the development of retail office or apartments including through joint ventures there are risks inherent in any new development includingwe may not obtain the zoning occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations necessary to complete the development a delay in receiving these approvals could affect adversely the returns we expect to receive any new construction involves the possibility of construction delays and cost overruns that may increase project costsdefects in design or construction may result in delays and additional costs to remedy the defect or require a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the defectwe may not be able to meet the loan covenants in any financing obtained to fund the new development creating default risks the development of timeshare units could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for residential fractional or interval ownership increases in mortgage rates andor decreases in mortgage availability market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell the timeshares for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate 19  in addition to the extent that developments are conducted through joint ventures this creates additional risks including the possibility that our partners may not meet their financial obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours see we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts any of the above factors could affect adversely our and our partners ability to complete the developments on schedule and along the scope that currently is contemplated or to achieve the intended value of these projects for these reasons there can be no assurances as to the value to be realized by the company from these transactions or any future similar transactionswe do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels to maintain our status as a reit we are not permitted to operate any of our hotels as a result we have entered into management agreements with thirdparty managers to operate our hotel properties for this reason we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of our hotels such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates repositioning of a hotel food and beverage pricing and certain similar matters although we consult with our hotel operators with respect to strategic business plans the hotel operators are under no obligation to implement any of our recommendations with respect to these matters while we monitor the hotel managers performance we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately the cash flow from our hotels may be affected adversely if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name because our management agreements are long term agreements we also may not be able to terminate these agreements if we believe the manager is not performing adequately from time to time we have had and continue to have differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements we generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations however if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to thirdparty dispute resolution failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements or the failure of our managers to adequately manage the risks associated with hotel operations including cybersecurity risks could affect adversely our results of operations in addition our hotel managers or their affiliates manage and in some cases own have invested in or provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete with our hotels all of which may result in conflicts of interest as a result our hotel managers have in the past made and may in the future make decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest we are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor our thirdparty managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our consolidated hotels other than employing but not managing associates at our properties in brazil new zealand and australia we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force particularly those hotels with unionized labor from time to time hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes lockouts public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity we also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes involving our thirdparty managers and their labor force or other events the resolution of labor disputes or renegotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs a significant component of our hotel operating costs either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs as we are not the employer nor bound by any collective bargaining agreement we do not negotiate with any labor organization and it is the responsibility of each propertys manager to enter into such labor contracts our ability if any to have any material impact on the outcome of these negotiations is restricted by and dependent on the individual management agreement covering a specific property and we may have little ability to control the outcome of these negotiationsour hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive in the marketplace maintain brand standards or to comply with applicable laws or regulations the timing and costs of such renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments we are required by our loan agreements or agreements with our hotel managers to make agreed upon capital expenditures in addition we will need to make further capital expenditures in order to remain competitive with other hotels to maintain the economic value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations the timing of these improvements can affect hotel performance particularly if the improvements require closure of a significant number of rooms or other features of the hotels such as ballrooms meeting space and restaurants these capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost overruns and delays in addition because we depend on external sources of capital we may not have the necessary funds to invest and if we fail to maintain our properties in accordance with brand standards set by our managers the manager may 20  terminate the management agreement moreover we may not necessarily realize a significant or any improvement in the performance of the hotels in which we make these investments the ownership of hotels outside the united states and the expansion of our business into new markets outside of the united states will expose us to risks related to owning hotels in those international markets part of our business strategy is to expand our presence outside of the united states as of december 31 2013 we own directly 15 hotels located outside of the united states we also are party to a joint venture that owns 19 hotels in europe and to a joint venture that owns one hotel in australia and a noncontrolling interest in two hotels currently open and five hotels in development in india we may have difficulty managing our expansion into new geographic markets where we have limited knowledge and understanding of the local economy an absence of business relationships in the area or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures and regulations there are risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states which include employment laws and practices tax laws which may provide for income or other taxes or tax rates that exceed those of the us and which may provide that foreign earnings that are repatriated directly or indirectly are subject to dividend withholding tax requirements or other restrictions and which may affect our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a tax efficient manner compliance with and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy the willingness of domestic or international lenders to provide financing and changes in the availability cost and terms of such financing adverse changes in local political economic and market conditions insurance coverage related to terrorist events changes in interest rates andor currency exchange rates and difficulties in hedging these risks regulations regarding the incurrence of debtdifficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries and difficulties in complying with us rules governing reits while operating outside of the united states any of these factors could affect adversely our ability to obtain all of the intended benefits of our international country expansion if we do not effectively manage this expansion and successfully integrate the international hotels into our organization our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts we have made investments in joint ventures and are exploring further investment opportunities in the united states asia europe and latin america we may from time to time invest as a coventurer in other entities holding hotel properties instead of purchasing hotel properties directly we also may sell interests in existing properties to a third party as part of forming a joint venture with such third party investments in joint ventures may involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions coventurers often share control over the operation of a joint venture actions by a coventurer also could subject the assets to additional risks as a result of any of the following circumstances our coventurer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our or the joint ventures interests or goals or our coventurer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives although generally we will seek to maintain sufficient control of any joint venture in order to permit our objectives to be achieved we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers from focusing their time and effort on our business our management agreements could affect the sale or financing of our hotelsunder the terms of our management agreements we generally may not sell lease or otherwise transfer our hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other 21  conditions our ability to finance or sell our properties depending upon the structure of such transactions may require the managers consent if the manager does not consent to such sale or financing we may be precluded from taking actions in our best interest we may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance program for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts and neither u s nor foreign terrorism insurance laws or regulations ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future we generally obtain terrorism insurance to cover property damage caused by acts of terrorism under separate standalone policies of insurance as well as policies on us properties which currently are subject to us federal government cost sharing as provided in the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act tripra we also have terrorism insurance under our general liability program and in our program for directors and officers coverage we also obtain terrorism insurance to cover some of our foreign properties through insurance programs involving or administered by foreign governments we may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance policies for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts and neither us nor foreign terrorism insurance legislation or regulations ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future tripra is due to expire on december 31 2014 there is no assurance that terrorism insurance will be readily available or affordable before or after expiration of tripra in december 2014 or that tripra will not be modified repealed or allowed to expirewhile tripra allows direct insurers to be reimbursed for certain losses they incur on us properties resulting from nuclear biological chemical and radiological nbcr perils tripra does not require insurers to offer coverage for these perils and to date insurers are not willing to provide this coverage even with government reimbursement any damage related to war and to nbcr incidents therefore is excluded under policies covering our us properties moreover many of our foreign properties are not covered against nbcr perils we obtain a certain amount of property insurance coverage on our us properties for nbcr perils through our whollyowned subsidiary that acts as our direct insurer against such perils to the extent of reimbursement under tripra we ultimately are responsible for any loss borne by our insurance subsidiary as a result of the above there remains uncertainty regarding the adequacy and cost of terrorism coverage that will be available to protect our interests in the event of terrorist attacks that impact our properties some potential losses are not covered by insurance we or our hotel managers carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability property business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties these policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar types of properties generally our allrisk property policies provide coverage that is available on a peroccurrence basis and that for each occurrence has an overall limit as well as various sublimits on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive sublimits exist for certain types of claims such as service interruption debris removal expediting costs landscaping replacement and natural disasters such as earthquakes floods and hurricanes and may be subject to annual aggregate coverage limits the dollar amounts of these sublimits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit in this regard hotels in certain of our markets including california florida and new zealand have in the past been and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters recovery under the applicable policies also is subject to substantial deductibles and complex calculations of lost business income there is no assurance that this insurance where maintained will fully fund the rebuilding or restoration of a hotel that is impacted by an earthquake hurricane or other natural disaster or the income lost as a result of the damage our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined together for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sublimits contained in our policies have been exceeded and in the case where the manager of one of our hotels provides this coverage any such claims will be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the managers program for the same purpose therefore if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels or in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by the manager affects hotels owned by others the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sublimits depending on the type of claim have been reached each affected hotel only may receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available we may incur losses in excess of insured limits and as a result we may be even less likely to receive complete coverage for risks that affect multiple properties such as earthquakes hurricanes or certain types of terrorism in addition there are other risks such as certain environmental hazards that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify coverage we also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier we could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel in that event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 22  litigation judgments or settlements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition we have accrued a potential litigation loss of approximately 68 million in connection with a lawsuit in the 166th judicial district court of bexar county texas involving the sale of land encumbered by a ground lease for the san antonio marriott rivercenter see part i item 3 legal proceedings for more information on the verdict and the status of the appeal we also are involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business and are vigorously defending these claims however no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings we believe based on currently available information that the results of such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but might be material to our operating results for any particular period depending in part upon the operating results for such period we also could become the subject of future claims by the operators of our hotels individuals or companies who use our hotels our investors our joint venture partners or regulating entities and these claims could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and performance we may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities related to hotels or businesses we acquire assets and entities that we have acquired or may in the future acquire may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse or only limited recourse against the sellers in general the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements may not survive long enough for us to become aware of such liabilities and seek recourse against our sellers while usually we require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive such indemnification often is limited and subject to various materiality thresholds a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses as a result there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with acquired hotels and entities may exceed our expectations plus we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects all of which may affect adversely our revenues expenses operating results and financial condition finally indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the assets and entities acquired by us while the sellers generally are contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities without regard to survival limitations materiality thresholds deductibles or caps on losses there can be no guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses in addition to those incurred by the sellers we depend on our key personnelour success depends on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel none of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers we cannot assure you that these key personnel will remain employed by us while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our financial performance exchange rate fluctuations could affect adversely our financial results as a result of the expansion of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the euro the canadian dollar the mexican peso the australian dollar the new zealand dollar the british pound sterling the polish zloty swedish krona the brazilian real and the chilean peso although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of these and other foreign currencies these transactions if entered into will not eliminate that risk entirely to the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in the same currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate revenues or earnings in other currencies the conversion of such amounts to us dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our revenues or earnings applicable reit laws may restrict certain business activities as a reit host inc is subject to various restrictions on the types of income it can earn assets it can own and activities in which it can engage business activities that could be restricted by applicable reit laws include but are not limited to activities such as developing alternative uses of real estate including the development andor sale of timeshare or condominium units due to these restrictions we anticipate that we will conduct certain business activities including those mentioned above in one or more of our taxable reit subsidiaries our taxable reit subsidiaries are taxable as regular c corporations and are subject to federal state local and if applicable foreign taxation on their taxable income 23  we may be unable to sell properties because real estate investments are inherently illiquid real estate properties generally cannot be sold quickly and accordingly we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions the inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could affect adversely our financial condition and the ability to service our debt in addition under the federal income tax laws applicable to reits we may be limited in our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets our ground lease payments may increase faster than the revenues we receive from the hotels located on the leased ground as of december 31 2013 36 of our hotels are subject to thirdparty ground leases encumbering all or a portion of the hotel these ground leases generally require periodic increases in ground rent payments which often are based on economic indicators such as the consumer price index our ability to pay ground rent could be affected adversely to the extent that our hotel revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases in addition if we were to sell a hotel encumbered by a ground lease the buyer would be required to assume the ground lease which may result in a lower sales price environmental problems are possible and can be costly we believe that our properties comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws unidentified environmental liabilities could arise however and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance additionally even after we have sold a property we may be liable for environmental liabilities that occurred during our ownership federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property the owner or operator may be required to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site environmental laws also govern the presence maintenance and removal of toxic or hazardous substances these laws require that owners or operators of buildings properly manage and maintain these substances and notify and train those who may come into contact with them and undertake special precautions these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to toxic or hazardous materials compliance with other government regulations can be costly our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation including title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons these laws and regulations may be changed from timetotime or new regulations adopted resulting in additional costs of compliance including potential litigation for example the ada was revised substantially in september 2010 and our facilities were required to comply with the new regulations by march 15 2012 a determination that we are not in compliance with the ada could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance imposition of fines or an award of attorneys fees to private litigants compliance with the ada and other laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the operations of our international properties are subject to a variety of united states and international laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws but we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international properties might be subject and the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted24  risks of ownership of host incs common stock there are limitations on the acquisition of host inc common stock and changes in control host incs charter and

common stock we have in the past and may in the future issue additional shares of common stock to raise the capital necessary to finance hotel acquisitions fund capital expenditures refinance debt or for other corporate purposes sales of a substantial number of shares of host incs common stock or the perception that sales could occur could affect adversely prevailing market prices for host incs common stock in addition holders of op units who redeem their units and receive at host incs election shares of host inc common stock will be able to sell those shares freely as of december 31 2013 there are approximately 95 million op units outstanding owned by third parties that are redeemable which represents approximately 13 of all outstanding units further a substantial number of shares of host incs common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans we maintain two stockbased compensation plans i the comprehensive stock plan whereby we may award to participating employees and directors restricted shares of common stock options to purchase common stock and deferred shares of common stock and ii an employee stock purchase plan at december 31 2013 there were approximately 18 million shares of host incs common stock reserved and available for issuance under the comprehensive stock plan and employee stock purchase plan and 07 million outstanding options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of 1541 per share also as of december 31 2013 host lp had outstanding 400 million principal amount of exchangeable senior debentures that currently are exchangeable for cash shares of host incs common stock or any combination thereof assuming the holders elected to exchange and we elected to settle in shares of host inc common stock the debentures would be exchangeable for approximately 299 million shares based on the current exchange price while these debentures currently are exchangeable through march 31 2014 based on past trading prices of host inc common stock whether they remain exchangeable after march 31 2014 will depend on then current trading prices of host inc common stockour earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of host incs common stock we believe that the market value of a reits equity securities is based primarily upon the markets perception of the reits growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions whether from operations sales acquisitions development or refinancings and secondarily is based upon the value of the underlying assets for that reason shares of host incs common stock 26  may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may impact negatively the market price of host incs common stock our failure to meet the markets expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would affect adversely the market price of host incs common stock market interest rates may affect the price of shares of host incs common stock we believe that one of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a reit is the dividend rate on the shares considered as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of reit shares may expect a higher dividend rate thus higher market interest rates could cause the market price of host incs common stock to decrease federal income tax risks to qualify as a reit each of host inc and its subsidiary reits are required to distribute at least 90 of its taxable income excluding net capital gain regardless of available cash or outstanding obligations to continue to qualify as a reit host inc is required to distribute to its stockholders with respect to each year at least 90 of its taxable income excluding net capital gain to the extent that host inc satisfies this distribution requirement but distributes less than 100 of its taxable income and net capital gain for the taxable year it will be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition host inc will be subject to a nondeductible 4 excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by host inc with respect to the calendar year are less than the sum of 1 85 of its ordinary income 2 95 of its net capital gain and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior years less excess distributions from prior years host inc intends to make distributions subject to the availability of cash and in compliance with any debt covenants to its stockholders in order to comply with the distribution requirement and to avoid the imposition of a significant nondeductible 4 excise tax and will rely for this purpose on distributions from host lp and its subsidiaries there are differences in timing between host incs recognition of taxable income and its receipt of cash available for distribution due to among other things the seasonality of the lodging industry and the fact that some taxable income will be phantom taxable income which is taxable income that is not matched with cash flow due to transactions entered into in years prior to host incs conversion to a reit host inc could recognize substantial amounts of phantom taxable income in the future it is possible that any differences between the recognition of taxable income and the receipt of the related cash could require us to borrow funds or for host inc to issue additional equity in order to enable host inc to meet its distribution requirements and therefore to maintain its reit status and to avoid the nondeductible 4 excise tax in addition because the reit distribution requirements prevent host inc from retaining earnings generally we will be required to refinance debt at its maturity with additional debt or equity it is possible that any of these sources of funds if available at all would not be sufficient to meet host incs distribution and tax obligations host lp owns 100 of the outstanding common stock and a portion of the outstanding preferred stock of two entities that have elected to be treated as reits each of these subsidiary reits are subject to the same requirements that host inc must satisfy in order to qualify as a reit including the distribution requirements described above adverse tax consequences would occur if host inc or any of its subsidiary reits fail to qualify as a reit we believe that host inc has been organized and has operated in such a manner so as to qualify as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year beginning january 1 1999 and host inc currently intends to continue to operate as a reit during future years in addition host inc owns through host lp two entities that have elected to be treated as reits as the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a reit are limited no assurance can be provided that host inc currently qualifies as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit or that each of host incs subsidiary reits qualify as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit if any of the subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit it is possible that host inc would fail to qualify as a reit unless it or the subsidiary reit could avail itself of certain relief provisions new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change significantly the tax laws with respect to an entitys qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of its reit qualification if host inc or any of its subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit and any available relief provisions did not apply the nonqualifying reit would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates moreover unless entitled to statutory relief the nonqualifying reit would not qualify as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which reit qualification was lost any determination that host inc or one of its subsidiary reits does not qualify as a reit will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce materially the value of host incs common stock the additional tax liability of host 27  inc or the subsidiary reit for the year or years in which the relevant entity did not qualify as a reit would reduce its net earnings available for investment debt service or distributions to stockholders furthermore the nonqualifying entity no longer would be required to make distributions to its stockholders as a condition to reit qualification and all of its distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary c corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that if host inc were to fail to qualify as a reit host incs stockholders currently taxed as individuals would be taxed on those dividends at capital gain rates and host incs corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the code host incs failure to qualify as a reit also would cause an event of default under host lps credit facility which default could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due thereunder which in turn would constitute an event of default under host lps outstanding debt securities if our leases are not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes each of host inc and its subsidiary reits would fail to qualify as a reit to qualify as a reit host inc must satisfy two gross income tests pursuant to which specified percentages of its gross income must be passive income such as rent for the rent paid pursuant to the hotel leases with our trs which rental income currently constitutes substantially all of host incs and each of our subsidiary reits gross income to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests our leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and must not be treated as service contracts joint ventures or some other type of arrangement we believe that the leases will be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance however that the internal revenue service irs will agree with this characterization if the leases were not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes neither host inc nor either of our subsidiary reits would be able to satisfy either of the two gross income tests applicable to reits and each likely would lose its reit status if our affiliated lessees fail to qualify as taxable reit subsidiaries each of host inc and its subsidiary reits would fail to qualify as a reit rent paid by a lessee that is a related party tenant of host inc will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to reits we lease substantially all of our hotels to our subsidiary or its affiliates that is taxable as a regular c corporation and that has elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary with respect to host inc and to each subsidiary reit so long as any affiliated lessee qualifies as a taxable reit subsidiary it will not be treated as a related party tenant we believe that our affiliated lessees have qualified and will continue to qualify and that the taxable reit subsidiaries of each of our subsidiary reits have qualified and will continue to qualify to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance however that the irs will not challenge the status of a taxable reit subsidiary for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in disqualifying any of our affiliated lessees including the taxable reit subsidiaries of our subsidiary reits from treatment as a taxable reit subsidiary it is possible that host inc or a subsidiary reit would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to reits and substantially all of its income would fail to qualify for the gross income tests if host inc or a subsidiary reit failed to meet either the asset tests or the gross income tests each likely would lose its reit status despite the reit status of each of host inc and its subsidiary reits we remain subject to various taxes one of the subsidiary reits of host inc will be required to pay federal income tax at the highest regular corporate rate on builtin gain recognized as a result of the sale of one or more of its hotels prior to the expiration of the applicable 10year holding period including certain hotels acquired from starwood and its affiliates in 2006 the total amount of gain on which the subsidiary reit would be subject to corporate income tax if all of its builtin gain assets were sold in a taxable transaction prior to the expiration of the applicable 10year holding period would be material to it recently enacted legislation however has reduced the 10year period to five years in the case of dispositions of assets in 2012 or 2013 in addition we expect that we could recognize other substantial deferred tax liabilities in the future without any corresponding receipt of cash notwithstanding host incs status as a reit host inc and our subsidiaries including our subsidiary reits are subject to federal state local and foreign taxes on their income and property in certain cases for example host inc and our subsidiary reits will pay tax on certain types of income that are not distributed and will be subject to a 100 excise tax on transactions with a taxable reit subsidiary that are not conducted on an arms length basis moreover the taxable reit subsidiaries of host inc and our subsidiary reits are taxable as regular c corporations and will pay federal state and local income tax on their net income at the applicable corporate rates and foreign taxes to the extent that they own assets or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions host lp is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes and any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc 28  if the irs were to challenge successfully host lps status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes host inc would cease to qualify as a reit and would suffer other adverse consequences we believe that host lp qualifies to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership it is not subject to federal income tax on its income instead each of its partners including host inc is required to report and pay tax if applicable on such partners allocable share of its income no assurance can be provided however that the irs will not challenge host lps status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating host lp as a corporation for federal income tax purposes host inc would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to reits and accordingly would cease to qualify as a reit if host lp fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or host inc fails to qualify as a reit either failure would cause an event of default under host lps credit facility that in turn could constitute an event of default under host lps outstanding debt securities also the failure of host lp to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes would cause it to become subject to federal state and foreign corporate income tax which tax would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners including host inc as a reit each of host inc and its subsidiary reits is subject to limitations on its ownership of debt and equity securities subject to certain exceptions a reit generally is prohibited from owning securities in any one issuer to the extent that 1 the value of such securities exceeds 5 of the value of the reits total assets 2 the securities owned by the reit represent more than 10 of the issuers outstanding voting securities or 3 the reit owns more than 10 of the value of the issuers outstanding securities a reit is permitted to own securities of a subsidiary in an amount that exceeds the 5 value test and the 10 vote or value test if the subsidiary elects to be a taxable reit subsidiary however a reit may not own securities of taxable reit subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 25 of the value of the reits total assets if host inc or any of its subsidiary reits were to violate these ownership limitations each likely would lose its reit status each of host inc or its subsidiary reits may be required to pay a penalty tax upon the sale of a hotel the federal income tax provisions applicable to reits provide that any gain realized by a reit from the sale of property held as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100 excise tax under existing law whether property including hotels is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is a question of fact that depends upon all of the facts and circumstances with respect to the particular transaction we intend to hold our hotels for investment with a view to longterm appreciation to engage in the business of acquiring and owning hotels and to make occasional sales of hotels consistent with our investment objectives there can be no assurance however that the irs might not contend that one or more of these sales are subject to the 100 excise tax risks relating to redemption of op units a holder who offers its op units for redemption may have adverse tax consequencesa holder whose op units are redeemed will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as having sold the op units the sale of these units is a taxable event and the holder thereof will be treated as realizing an amount equal to the sum of 1 the value of the common stock or cash the holder receives and 2 the amount of host lps nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units the gain or loss recognized by the holder of op units is measured by the difference between the amount realized by the holder and the holders tax basis in the op units redeemed which tax basis includes the amount of host lps nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units it is possible that the amount of gain andor the tax liability related thereto that the holder recognizes and pays could exceed the value of the common stock or cash that the holder receives differences between an investment in shares of host inc common stock and host lp op units may affect redeemed holders of op unitsif a holder of op units elects to have its units redeemed we will determine whether the holder receives cash or shares of host incs common stock in exchange for the op units although an investment in shares of host incs common stock is substantially similar to an investment in host lp op units there are some differences these differences include form of organization management structure voting rights liquidity and federal and state income taxation some of which differences may be material to investors 29
