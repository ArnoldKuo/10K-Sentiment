operates as a selfmanaged and selfadministered reit host inc owns properties and conducts operations through host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and in which it holds approximately 987 of the partnership interests op units as of december 31 2013 the remaining partnership interests are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lps daytoday management and control as of february 14 2014 our consolidated lodging portfolio consists of 114 primarily luxury and upperupscale hotels containing approximately 60000 rooms with the majority located in the united states and with 15 of the properties located outside of the us in canada new zealand chile australia mexico and brazil we also are developing two hotels in rio de janeiro brazil in addition we own noncontrolling interests in two international joint ventures a joint venture in europe which owns 19 luxury and upper upscale hotels with approximately 6400 rooms in france italy spain the netherlands the united kingdom belgium poland germany and sweden and a joint venture in asiapacific which owns one upscale hotel in australia and minority interests in two operating hotels one upscale and one midscale in india and five additional hotels in india currently under development we also hold noncontrolling investments in the 255room hyatt place nashville downtown in tennessee a 131unit vacation ownership project under development adjacent to our hyatt regency maui resort amp spa and the philadelphia marriott downtown in which we sold an 89 ownership interest in january 2014 the lodging industry the lodging industry in the united states consists of private and public entities that operate in an extremely diversified market under a variety of brand names the lodging industry has several key participants ownersown the hotel and typically enter into an agreement for an independent third party to manage the hotel these properties may be branded and operated under the managers brand or branded under a franchise agreement and operated by the franchisee or by an independent hotel manager the properties also may be operated as an independent hotel by an independent hotel manager ownermanagersown the hotel and operate the property with their own management team these properties may be branded under a franchise agreement operated as an independent hotel or operated under the owners brand we are prohibited from operating and managing hotels under applicable reit rules 1  franchisorsown a brand or brands and strive to grow their revenues by expanding the number of hotels in their franchise system franchisors provide their hotels with brand recognition marketing support and centralized reservation systems for the franchised hotels franchisormanagersown a brand or brands and also operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner or franchisee managersoperate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner but do not themselves own a brand the hotels may be operated under a franchise agreement or as an independent hotel the hotel manager is responsible for the daytoday operation of the hotel including the employment of hotel staff the determination of room rates the development of sales and marketing plans the preparation of operating and capital expenditure budgets and the preparation of financial reports for the owner they typically receive fees based on the revenues and profitability of the hotel the lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different segments each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs luxury upper upscale upscale midscale with and without food and beverage service and economy our portfolio primarily consists of luxury and upper upscale properties that are located in the central business districts of major cities near airports and resortconference destinations which are operated under internationally recognized brand names such as marriott hyatt starwood and accor see  our hotel portfolio revenues earned at our hotels consist of three broad categories rooms food and beverage and other revenues while approximately 65 of our revenue is generated from room sales many of our properties feature a variety of amenities that help drive demand and profitability our hotels typically include meeting and banquet facilities a variety of restaurants and lounges swimming pools exercise facilities andor spas gift shops and parking facilities the combination of which enable them to serve business leisure and group travelers the following graphs summarize the composition of the 114 hotels in our consolidated portfolio based on the percentage of revenues represented by our luxury upper upscale and other categories and by property type   2  our industry is influenced by the cyclical relationship between the supply of and demand for hotel rooms lodging demand growth typically is related to the vitality of the overall economy in addition to local market factors that stimulate travel to specific destinations in particular economic indicators such as gdp growth business investment and employment growth are some of the primary drivers of lodging demand the global recession of 2008 and 2009 resulted in a considerable decline both in consumer and business spending and a severe decline in demand within the lodging industry beginning in 2010 as economic conditions gradually have stabilized and strengthened lodging demand has improved steadily driven by moderate gdp growth in the us coupled with increasing business investment the primary demand driver has been transient demand from business and leisure travelers and to a much lesser degree group business we expect demand to continue to improve in 2014 as the potential for growth in group business and expected continued growth in transient business could lead to further revpar improvements however several economic headwinds may hamper lodging demand including the expected tapering of the us federal reserve bondbuying program known as quantitative easing the tenuous nature of the euro zone recovery the slowdown in growth in china and general instability in emerging markets lodging supply growth generally is driven by overall lodging demand as extended periods of strong demand growth tend to encourage new development however the rate of supply growth also is influenced by a number of additional factors including the availability of capital interest rates construction costs and unique market considerations the relatively long leadtime required to complete the development of hotels makes supply growth easier to forecast than demand growth but increases the volatility of the cyclical behavior of the lodging industry as illustrated in the charts below for the us lodging industry at different points in the cycle demand may increase when there is no new supply or supply may grow when demand is declining the decline in lodging demand during the recession of 2008 through 2009 and the lack of available financing for new hotel construction caused a significant reduction in hotel development as a result supply growth was relatively low in 2010 through 2013 overall we expect domestic supply growth to remain constrained in 2014 at approximately 15 which still is below the historical average of approximately 2 additionally we believe that the average supply growth for upper upscale hotels in our markets will be approximately 09 in 2014 however new york city and washington dc are expected to experience above average growth in supply which will increase competition in these markets we anticipate that demand growth will exceed supply growth in the near term resulting in continued growth in revenue per available room revpar which is consistent with analysis prepared by pkf hospitality research revpar is a commonly used operational measure of hotel performance in the lodging industry calculated as the product of average room rate and occupancy percentage occupancy levels in the upperupscale market currently are above their 15year average therefore while there is potential for occupancy growth we believe revpar growth primarily will be driven by increases in average room rate however there can be no assurance that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties or improvement in margins will continue for any number of reasons including those discussed above 3  our portfolio primarily consists of upper upscale hotels and accordingly its performance is best understood in comparison to the upper upscale segment rather than the entire industry the charts below detail the historical supply demand and revpar growth for the us lodging industry and for the us upper upscale segment for 2009 to 2013 and forecast data for 2014 us lodging industry supply demand and revpar growth us upper upscale supply demand and revpar growth   business strategy our primary longterm business objective is to provide superior total returns to our equity holders through a combination of appreciation in asset values growth in earnings and dividend distributions to achieve this objective we seek to drive operating results at our properties through aggressive asset management acquire properties in urban and resortconference destinations we will continue to focus on target markets in gateway domestic cities such as new york washington dc boston miami chicago los angeles san francisco san diego seattle and hawaii and international cities such as london paris munich berlin madrid barcelona stockholm 4  sydney tokyo rio de janeiro são paulo and mexico city which we believe have strong demand generators that appeal to multiple customer segments and have high barriers to entry that limit new supply while our focus will remain primarily on luxury and upper upscale properties we will remain opportunistic and may acquire or develop hotels in other lodging segments or markets wherever possible match each property with the appropriate manager and brand affiliation for the majority of our portfolio we seek properties that are franchised or operated by leading management companies as we believe their widespread brand recognition and brand loyalty programs can maximize demand we will also look for opportunities to enhance flexibility in our management agreements which can increase the market value of the property strategically invest in major redevelopment and return on investment roi projects in order to maximize the inherent value in our portfolio maintain a strong balance sheet with a low leverage level and balanced debt maturities in order to minimize our cost of capital and to maximize our financial flexibility in order to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging cycle expand our global portfolio holdings and revenue sources through joint ventures or direct acquisitions that diversify our investments and recycle capital through the disposition of assets to better align our portfolio within our target gateway markets we also may opportunistically dispose of hotels to take advantage of market conditions or in situations where the hotels are at a competitive risk since 2002 the percentage of revenues from our target markets in the us and internationally has increased from approximately 55 to 75 the following graph summarizes the composition of our consolidated hotels by market based on percentage of revenues which excludes properties owned by our european and asiapacific joint ventures  acquisitions and development our acquisition strategy focuses on acquiring hotels at attractive yields that exceed our cost of capital in our target markets as discussed above these markets consist of gateway cities in the us and in key international cities that are positioned to attract premium corporate leisure and international travelers and have significant barriers to entry based on historical trends we believe these markets will have favorable longterm supply and demand dynamics and consequently better potential for revenue growth in the us we will focus primarily on acquiring upper upscale and luxury hotels at prices below replacement cost and secondarily developing midscale and upscale hotels with strategic partners in target markets our efforts in europe will include the acquisition of upper upscale and luxury hotels in our target markets through our european joint venture in the 5  asiapacific and latin america regions we will concentrate both on the acquisition of upper upscale and luxury hotels and the development of midscale and upscale hotels in our target markets which we may look to acquire directly or through joint ventures with strategic partners we may acquire additional properties through various structures including transactions involving single assets portfolios joint ventures and acquisitions of the securities or assets of other reits value enhancement initiatives we look to enhance the value of our portfolio by identifying and executing strategies designed to achieve the highest and best use of our properties these projects have included the development of timeshare office space or condominium units on excess land redevelopment or expansion of existing retail space the purchase or extension of ground leases the acquisition of air rights or development entitlements or the restructuring of management agreements we believe that the successful execution of these projects will create significant value for the company redevelopment and return on investment projects we pursue opportunities to enhance asset value by completing select capital improvements outside the scope of recurring renewal and replacement capital expenditures these projects are designed to take advantage of changing market conditions and the favorable location of our properties to increase profitability and enhance customer satisfaction we also evaluate our capital expenditures projects based on their environmental impact in collaboration with our hotel managers we evaluate new products and systems designed to optimize energy performance and reduce water consumption many of these sustainability projects include the renewal and replacement of systems and equipment reaching the end of its life cycle with more efficient solutions and incorporating sustainable materials and construction practices within renovation projects we also invest in building infrastructure projects that mitigate potential risks associated with extreme weather events or climate change our capital expenditures projects generally fall into the following categories redevelopment projects these projects are designed to optimally position our hotels within their markets and competitive set redevelopment projects include extensive renovations of guest rooms including bathrooms lobbies food and beverage outlets expanding ballroom and meeting rooms and major mechanical system upgrades targeted return on investment projects these roi projects often are smaller and focused on specific areas such as converting unprofitable or underutilized space into meeting space adding guestrooms or implementing a building automation system acquisition capital expenditures projects in connection with the acquisition of a property we prepare capital and operational improvement plans designed to improve profitability and enhance the guest experience these projects may include required renewal and replacement projects significant redevelopment and even rebranding of the property and represent a key component of our decision to invest in a hotel and typically are completed within two to three years of acquisition renewal and replacement capital expenditures we work closely with our managers to ensure that renewal and replacement capital expenditures are spent efficiently in order to maximize the profitability of the hotel while minimizing disruption to operations typically room renovations occur at intervals of approximately seven years but the timing may vary based on the type of property and equipment being replaced these refurbishments generally are divided into the following types soft goods case goods bathroom and infrastructure soft goods include items such as carpeting bed spreads curtains and wall vinyl and may require more frequent updates in order to maintain brand quality standards case goods include items such as dressers desks couches restaurant and meeting room chairs and tables and generally are not replaced as frequently bathroom renovations include the replacement of tile vanity lighting and plumbing fixtures infrastructure includes the physical plant of the hotel including the roof elevators façade and fire systems asset management as the owner of a diverse portfolio of properties we are in a unique position to work with our managers to maximize revenues while minimizing operating costs the size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading operators and brands in the industry allow us to benchmark similar hotels and identify best practices and efficiencies that can improve the longterm profitability of our hotels by driving group business which allows our operators to shift the mix of business to the higherrated transient segments we also carefully evaluate our management and franchise agreements prior to the acquisition of a new hotel or upon termination of an existing contract this may include obtaining franchise rights for hotels and hiring an independent operator to manage the hotel which may be more efficient for some hotels while still maintaining the brand recognition of the existing manager see operational agreements for further discussion capital structure and liquidity profile in order to maintain its qualification as a reit host inc is required to distribute 90 of its taxable income other than net capital gain to its stockholders and as a result generally relies on external sources of capital as well as cash from operations to finance growth we use a variety of debt and equity instruments to fund our external growth including senior notes and mortgage debt exchangeable debentures common and preferred stock offerings issuances of op units and joint ventureslimited partnerships to take advantage of the prevailing market conditions while we may issue debt at any time management believes it is prudent over time to target a leverage ratio of approximately 30x debttoebitda we believe that lower leverage reduces our overall cost of capital and our earnings volatility and increases our access to capital thereby providing us with 6  the necessary flexibility to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging cycle which we consider a key competitive advantage we also seek to structure our debt profile to allow us to access different forms of financing primarily senior notes and exchangeable debentures as well as mortgage debt particularly outside of the us when debt is priced reasonably and can be denominated in the local currency generally this means we look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt minimize nearterm maturities and maintain a balanced maturity schedule joint ventures we expect to continue to utilize joint ventures to finance external growth we believe joint ventures provide a significant means to access external capital and spread the inherent risk of hotel ownership our primary focus for joint ventures is in international markets which helps to diversify exposure to market risk dispositions our disposition strategy is aligned with our overall portfolio focus to reallocate our investments to target gateway markets generally our dispositions will be focused on secondary or tertiary markets or as part of our strategy to limit our total investment within individual markets we may dispose of assets in our target markets through direct sales or through the creation of joint ventures when we have the opportunity to capitalize on value enhancement strategies and apply the proceeds to other business objectives additionally we will dispose of properties where we believe the potential for growth is constrained or on properties with significant capital expenditure requirements where we do not believe we would generate a significant return on the investment proceeds from dispositions are deployed to repay debt or fund acquisitions and roiredevelopment projects corporate responsibility hosts corporate responsibility strategy integrates fiscal environmental and social elements at both the corporate and portfolio levels our corporate responsibility program focuses on the following themes and objectives responsible investment invest in proven sustainability practices that create and drive valueenvironmental stewardship monitor and improve the resource efficiency and environmental footprint of our properties and corporate citizenship strengthen local communities through financial support community engagement and volunteer service management and governance our corporate responsibility program is managed by our corporate responsibility team and governed by the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors operating structure host inc operates through an umbrella partnership structure in which substantially all of its assets are held by host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and holds approximately 987 of the op units as of december 31 2013 a reit is a corporation that has elected to be treated as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code and that meets certain ownership organizational and operating requirements set forth under the code in general through payments of dividends to stockholders a reit is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level each op unit owned by holders other than host inc is redeemable at the option of the holder for an amount of cash equal to the market value of one share of host inc common stock multiplied by a factor of 1021494 rather than a conversion factor of 1 shareop unit that existed prior to the december 2009 stock dividend host inc has the right to acquire any op unit offered for redemption directly from the holder in exchange for 1021494 shares of host inc common stock instead of host lp redeeming such op unit for cash additionally for every share of common stock issued by host inc host lp will issue 97895 op units to host inc as of december 31 2013 noncontrolling limited partners held 95 million op units which were convertible into 97 million host inc common shares assuming that all op units held by noncontrolling limited partners were converted into common shares there would have been 7645 million common shares of host inc outstanding at december 31 2013 7  our operating structure is as follows  because host inc has elected to be treated as a reit certain tax laws limit the amount of nonqualifying income that host inc and host lp can earn including income derived directly from the operation of hotels as a result we lease substantially all of our consolidated properties to certain of our subsidiaries designated as taxable reit subsidiaries trs for federal income tax purposes or to third party lessees our trs are subject to income tax and are not limited as to the amount of nonqualifying income they can generate our trs enter into agreements with third parties to manage the operations of the hotels our trs also may own assets engaging in other activities that produce nonqualifying income such as the development of timeshare or condominium units subject to certain restrictions the difference between the hotels net operating cash flow and the aggregate rents paid to host lp is retained by our trs as taxable income accordingly the net effect of the trs leases is that while as a reit host inc generally is exempt from federal income tax to the extent that it meets specific distribution requirements among other reit requirements a portion of the net operating cash flow from our properties is subject to federal state and if applicable foreign income tax our hotel portfolio as of february 14 2014 we owned a portfolio of 114 hotel properties of which 99 are located in the united states and 15 are located in australia brazil canada chile mexico and new zealand our consolidated hotels located outside the united states collectively contain approximately 3826 rooms approximately 5 of our revenues were attributed to the operations of these foreign properties in each of 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we also are developing two hotel properties in brazilour consolidated hotels primarily consist of luxury and upper upscale properties all of our hotels generally are located in the central business districts of major cities near airports or in resortconference destinations that because of their locations typically benefit from barriers to entry for new supply thirtynine of our owned hotels representing approximately 63 of our revenues have in excess of 500 rooms the average age of our properties is 30 years although substantially all of the properties have benefited from significant renovations or major additions as well as regularly scheduled renewal and replacement and other capital improvements 8  by brand the following table details our consolidated hotel portfolio by brand as of february 14 2014         number             percentage of     brand   of hotels     rooms

an 89 interest in the property based on a market value of 303 million the property is subject to a mortgage loan of 230 millioncompetition the lodging industry is highly competitive competition often is specific to individual markets and is based on a number of factors including location brand guest facilities and amenities level of service room rates and the quality of accommodations the lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different segments each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs luxury upper upscale upscale midscale with and without food and beverage service and economy the classification of a property is based on lodging industry standards which take into consideration many factors such as guest facilities and amenities level of service and quality of accommodations most of our hotels operate in urban and resort markets either as luxury properties under such brand names as fairmont four seasons grand hyatt jw marriott ritzcarlton st regis the luxury collection and w or as upper upscale properties under such brand names as embassy suites hilton hyatt le méridien marriott executive apartments marriott marquis marriott suites pullman renaissance sheraton swissôtel and westin we also may selectively invest in upscale and midscale properties such as courtyard by marriott crowne plaza four points by sheraton hyatt place ibis novotel or residence inn by marriott particularly in international markets1 while our hotels primarily compete with other hotels in the luxury and upper upscale segments they also may compete with hotels in other lowertier segments in addition many management contracts for our hotels do not prohibit our managers from converting franchising or developing other hotel properties in our markets as a result our hotels compete with other hotels that our managers may own invest in manage or franchise we believe our properties enjoy competitive advantages associated with the hotel brands under which they operate the international marketing programs and reservation systems of these brands combined with the strong management systems and expertise they provide should enable our properties to perform favorably in terms of both occupancy and room rates in addition repeat guest business is enhanced by guest reward or guest recognition programs offered by most of these brands 1 this annual report contains registered trademarks that are the exclusive property of their respective owners which are companies other than us none of the owners of these trademarks their affiliates or any of their respective officers directors agents or employees has or will have any responsibility or liability for any information contained in this annual report12  we also compete with other reits and other public and private investors for the acquisition of new properties and investment opportunities both in domestic and international markets as we attempt to position our portfolio to take best advantage of changes in markets and travel patterns of our customers seasonality our hotel sales traditionally have experienced moderate seasonality which varies based on the individual property and the region hotel sales for our consolidated portfolio averaged approximately 24 27 23 and 26 for the first second third and fourth calendar quarters respectively in 2013 environmental and regulatory matters under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances these laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances in addition certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of hazardous or toxic materials and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released hazardous or toxic materials environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated and these restrictions may require corrective or other expenditures in connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels we potentially may be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities although currently we are not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us we can offer no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future operational agreements all of our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements with some of such hotels also subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operation under the designated brand under these agreements the managers generally have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the daytoday operation of the hotels including establishing room rates securing and processing reservations procuring inventories supplies and services providing periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers technical and operational experts and promoting and publicizing the hotels the managers provide all managerial and other employees for the hotels review the operation and maintenance of the hotels prepare reports budgets and projections and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels these support services include planning and policy services divisional financial services product planning and development employee staffing and training corporate executive management and certain inhouse legal services we have certain approval rights over budgets capital expenditures significant leases and contractual commitments and various other matters general terms and provisions  agreements governing the management and operation of our hotels typically include the terms described below term and fees for operational services the initial term of our management and operating agreements generally is 15 to 25 years with one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager the majority of our management agreements condition the managers right to exercise options for specified renewal terms upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria the manager typically receives compensation in the form of a base management fee which is calculated as a percentage generally 23 of annual gross revenues and an incentive management fee which typically is calculated as a percentage generally 1020 of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the hotel in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the base management fee is only 1 of annual gross revenues but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable to starwood under a separate license agreement as described below license services in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the operation of the hotels is subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to the designated brand including rights to use trademarks service marks and logos matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services although the term of these license agreements with starwood generally is coterminous with the corresponding operating agreements the license agreements contemplate the potential for continued brand affiliation even in the event of a termination of the operating agreement as noted above the starwood licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees generally 5 of gross revenues attributable to room sales and 2 of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales which amounts supplement the lower base management fee of 1 of gross revenues received by starwood under the operating agreements chain or system programs and services managers are required to provide chain or system programs and services generally that are furnished on a centralized basis such services include the development and operation of certain computer systems 13  and reservation services regional or other centralized management and administrative services marketing and sales programs and services training and other personnel services and other centralized or regional services as may be determined to be more efficiently performed on a centralized regional or group basis rather than on an individual hotel basis costs and expenses incurred in providing these chain or system programs and services generally are allocated on a cost reimbursement basis among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates or that otherwise benefit from these services working capital and fixed asset supplies we are required to maintain working capital for each hotel and to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies for example linen china glassware silver and uniforms we also are responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds available from working capital are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels for certain hotels the working capital accounts which would otherwise be maintained by the managers for each of such hotels are maintained on a pooled basis with managers being authorized to make withdrawals from such pooled account as otherwise contemplated with respect to working capital in accordance with the provisions of the management or operating agreements furniture fixtures and equipment replacements we are required to provide the managers with all furniture fixtures and equipment ffampe necessary for the operation of the hotels including funding any required ffampe replacements on an annual basis the managers prepare budgets for ffampe to be acquired and certain routine repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the necessary funds which budgets are subject to our review and approval for purposes of funding such expenditures a specified percentage typically 5 of the gross revenues of each hotel is deposited by the manager into an escrow or reserve account in our name to which the manager has access in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels our operating agreements contemplate that this reserve account also may be used to fund the cost of certain major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building as described below for certain of our marriottmanaged hotels we have entered into an agreement with marriott to allow for such expenditures to be funded from one pooled reserve account rather than funds being deposited into separate reserve accounts at each hotel with the minimum required balance maintained on an ongoing basis in that pooled reserve account being significantly below the amount that otherwise would have been maintained in such separate hotel reserve accounts for certain of our starwoodmanaged hotels the periodic reserve fund contributions which otherwise would be deposited into reserve accounts maintained by managers for each hotel are distributed to us and as to this pool of hotels we are responsible for providing funding of expenditures which otherwise would be funded from reserve accounts for each of the subject hotels building alterations improvements and renewals the managers are required to prepare an annual estimate of the expenditures necessary for major repairs alterations improvements renewals and replacements to the structural mechanical electrical heating ventilating air conditioning plumbing and elevators of each hotel along with alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required in the managers reasonable judgment to keep the hotel in a competitive efficient and economical operating condition that is consistent with brand standards we generally have approval rights as to such budgets and expenditures which we review and approve based on our managers recommendations and on our judgment expenditures for these major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building typically are funded directly by owners although as noted above our agreements with starwood contemplate that certain such expenditures may be funded from the reserve account treatment of additional owner funding as additional owner funding becomes necessary either for expenditures generally funded from the ffampe replacement funds or for any major repairs or improvements to the hotel building which may be required to be funded directly by owners most of our agreements provide for an economic benefit to us through an impact on the calculation of incentive management fees payable to our managers one approach frequently utilized at our marriottmanaged hotels is to provide such owner funding through loans which are repaid with interest from operational revenues with the repayment amounts reducing operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees another approach that is used at our starwoodmanaged hotels as well as with certain expenditures projects at our marriottmanaged hotels is to treat such owner funding as an increase to our investment in the hotel resulting in an increase to owners priority return with a corresponding reduction to the amount of operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees for our starwoodmanaged hotels that are subject to the pooled arrangement described above the amount of any additional reserve account funding is allocated to each of such hotels on a pro rata basis determined with reference to the net operating income of each hotel and the total net operating income of all such pooled hotels for the most recent operating year territorial protections certain management and operating agreements impose restrictions for a specified period which limit the manager and its affiliates from owning operating or licensing a hotel of the same brand within a specified area the area restrictions vary with each hotel from city blocks in urban areas to up to a multimile radius from the hotel in other areas sale of the hotel subject to specific agreements as to certain hotels see below under special termination rights we generally are limited in our ability to sell lease or otherwise transfer the hotels by the requirement that the transferee assume the related management agreements and meet specified other conditions including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the manager 14  performance termination rights in addition to any right to terminate that may arise as a result of a default by the manager most of our management and operating agreements include reserved rights by us to terminate management or operating agreements on the basis of the managers failure to meet certain performancebased metrics typically including a specified threshold return on owners investment in the hotel along with a failure of the hotel to achieve a specified revpar performance threshold established with reference to other competitive hotels in the market typically such performancebased termination rights arise in the event the operator fails to achieve specified performance thresholds over a consecutive twoyear period and are subject to the managers ability to cure and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts or in some instances waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees we have agreed in the past and may agree in the future to waive certain of these termination rights in exchange for consideration from a manager or its affiliates which consideration may include cash compensation or amendments to management agreements special termination rights in addition to any performancebased or other termination rights set forth in our management and operating agreements we have specific negotiated termination rights as to certain management and operating agreements with respect to our marriott portfolio subject to certain timing and other limitations these rights include termination rights applicable to 16 properties with respect to our starwood portfolio subject to certain timing and other limitations these rights include termination rights applicable to 8 properties we also have similar termination rights applicable to 8 other properties while the brand affiliation of a property may increase the value of a hotel the ability to dispose of a property unencumbered by a management agreement or even brand affiliation also can increase the value for prospective purchasers these termination rights can take a number of different forms including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation as well as termination without sale or other condition which may require payment of a fee these termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by ebitda require that a certain number of properties continue to maintain the brand affiliation or be restricted to a specific pool of assets employees as of december 31 2013 we had 242 employees of which 218 work in the united states we had 24 employees located in our offices in london rio de janeiro amsterdam and singapore none of hosts employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements other than those working in our office in rio de janeiro the number of employees referenced above does not include the hotel employees of our nine hotels in brazil new zealand and australia which while technically are host employees are under the direct supervision and control of our thirdparty hotel managers our thirdparty managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels although we do not manage employees at our consolidated hotels we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force particularly those hotels with unionized labor we believe relations with the employees of these third party managers are positive for a discussion of these relationships see part i item 1a risk factorswe are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor employees at certain of our thirdparty managed hotels are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to review and renewal on a regular basis for a discussion of these relationships see part i item 1a risk factorswe are subject to risks associated with the employment of

describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 financial risks and risks of operation our revenues and the value of our properties are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry the lodging industry is subject to changes in the travel patterns of business and leisure travelers both of which are affected by the strength of the economy as well as other factors the performance of the lodging industry has traditionally been closely linked with the performance of the general economy and specifically growth in gross domestic product gdp changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers particularly during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth may create difficulties for the industry over the longterm and adversely affect our results the majority of our hotels are classified as luxury or upper upscale in an economic downturn these types of hotels may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenue as compared to hotels in other categories that have lower room rates this characteristic may result from the fact that these hotels generally target business and highend leisure travelers in periods of economic difficulties business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel or seeking to reduce costs on their trips during the recession in 2008 and 2009 overall travel was reduced which had a significant effect on our results of operations while operating results have improved since then there continues to be uncertainty in the overall strength of the recovery in the united states europe and other parts of the world additionally continued high unemployment has slowed the pace of the economic recovery therefore there can be no assurance that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons including but not limited to slower than anticipated growth in the economy our results of operations and any forecast we make may be affected by and can change based on a variety of circumstances that affect the lodging industry including changes in the international national regional and local economic climate changes in business and leisure travel patterns the effect of terrorist attacks and terror alerts in the united states and internationally as well as other geopolitical disturbances supply growth in markets where we own hotels which may adversely affect demand at our properties the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers relative to competing hotels the performance of the managers of our hotels outbreaks of disease and the impact on travel of natural disasters and weather physical damage to our hotels as a result of earthquakes hurricanes or other natural disasters or the income lost as a result of the damagechanges in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors and unionization of the labor force at our hotels a reduction in our revenue or earnings as a result of the above risks may reduce our working capital impact our longterm business strategy and impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet certain covenants in our existing debt agreements in addition continued political uncertainty and changes in government policies in particular with respect to u s economic policy federal budget deficit concerns and the slowdown in the federal reserves bond buying program could have material adverse impacts on financial markets and economic conditions in the united states and throughout the world this in turn could directly or indirectly adversely affect lodging demand and therefore our business and financial condition in addition us government travel is approximately 5 of our business and may suffer as a result of us federal spending cuts resulting from regulations reducing the amount of travel by us government employees and contractors in 2013 we experienced weakened government demand for our hotel rooms in some markets such as washington dc which may continue depending on factors such as the outcome of us federal budget negotiations16  disruptions in the financial markets may affect adversely our business and results of operations our ability to obtain financing on reasonable and acceptable terms and our ability to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk the united states and global equity and credit markets have experienced and may in the future experience significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions this may cause the market price of the stock of many companies to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective and outstanding debt financings to widen considerably in the event these disruptions occur liquidity in the financial markets will be affected which may make terms for financings less attractive and in some cases result in the lack of availability of certain types of financing uncertainty regarding the stability of the equity and credit markets may impact negatively our ability to access additional shortterm and longterm financing on reasonable terms or at all which would impact negatively our liquidity and financial condition a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may impact negatively our ability to enter into derivative contracts in order to hedge risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity with which to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital debt service and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future if our operating results weaken significantly and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or if interest rates increase significantly we could face liquidity problems that could affect materially and adversely our results of operations and financial condition economic conditions may affect adversely the value of our hotels which may result in impairment charges on our properties we analyze our assets for impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable for example we analyze our assets for impairments when a property has current or projected losses from operations when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when other material trends contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred such that an assets carrying value may not be recoverable for impaired assets we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the propertys carrying value over its fair value we may incur additional impairment charges in the future which charges will affect negatively our results of operations we can provide no assurance that any impairment loss recognized would not be material to our results of operations for information on impairment charges taken in 2013 and 2012 see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies we depend on external sources of capital for future growth and we may be unable to access capital when necessaryunlike regular c corporations host inc must finance its growth and fund debt repayments largely with external sources of capital because it is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of its taxable income other than net capital gain in order to qualify as a reit including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which it does not receive cash funds used by host inc to make required distributions are provided through distributions from host lp our ability to access external capital could be hampered by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control including credit market conditions as discussed above unfavorable market perception of our growth potential decreases in our current and estimated future earnings or decreases in the market price of the common stock of host inc our ability to access additional capital also may be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness which under certain circumstances restrict our incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and host lp distributions the occurrence of any of these factors individually or in combination could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our future growth we have substantial debt and may incur additional debt as of december 31 2013 we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately 48 billion our substantial indebtedness requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures expansion efforts dividends and distributions and other general corporate needs additionally our substantial indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or to obtain financing for expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate needs on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all or affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions if our cash flow and working capital are not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness we will be required to raise additional funds through sales of host lps op units or host incs common stock the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by host lp or 17  the sale of our assets we cannot make any assurances that any of these sources of funds will be available to us or if available will be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient to meet our obligations or fulfill our business plan under certain circumstances we would be required to use the cash from some of the events described above to repay other indebtedness the terms of our debt place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and these restrictions reduce our operational flexibility and create default risks the documents governing the terms of our senior notes and our credit facility contain covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries these covenants restrict among other things our ability to conduct acquisitions mergers or consolidations unless the successor entity in such transaction assumes our indebtedness incur additional debt in excess of certain thresholds and without satisfying certain financial metrics create liens securing indebtedness unless an effective provision is made to secure our other indebtedness by such liens sell assets without using the proceeds from such sales for certain permitted uses or to make an offer to repay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness make distributions without satisfying certain financial metrics and conduct transactions with affiliates other than on an arms length basis and in certain instances without obtaining opinions as to the fairness of such transactions in addition certain covenants in our credit facility also require us and our subsidiaries to meet financial performance tests the restrictive covenants in the applicable indentures the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt including our mortgage debt will reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt in addition certain of our mortgage debt requires that to the extent cash flow from the hotels which secure such debt drops below stated levels we escrow cash flow after the payment of debt service until operations improve above the stated levels in some cases the lender may apply the escrowed amount to the outstanding balance of the mortgage debt if such provisions are triggered the amounts required to be escrowed may affect negatively our liquidity from these mortgaged properties by limiting our access to cash flow after debt service for a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition our ability to pay dividends and to make distributions may be limited or prohibited by the terms of our indebtedness or preferred units we are and may in the future become party to agreements and instruments that restrict or prevent the payment of dividends on classes and series of host inc capital stock and host lps payment of distributions on its classes of units under the terms of host lps credit facility distributions to host lp unitholders including host inc upon which host inc depends in order to obtain the cash necessary to pay dividends are permitted only to the extent that host lp can satisfy certain financial covenant tests concerning leverage fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage and meet other requirements we also will be subject to similar restrictions under the terms of our senior notes if our senior notes are no longer rated investment grade we are however permitted under our credit facility and senior notes indenture to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain host incs reit status under the terms of host lps outstanding preferred op units we are not permitted to make distributions on our common op units unless all cumulative distributions have been paid or funds for payment have been set aside for payment on our preferred op units in the event that we fail to pay the accrued distributions on our preferred op units for any reason including any restriction on making such distributions under the terms of our debt instruments as discussed above distributions will continue to accrue on such preferred op units and we will be prohibited from making any distributions on our common op units until all such accrued but unpaid distributions on our preferred op units have been paid or funds for such payment have been set aside an increase in interest rates would increase the interest costs on our credit facility and on our floating rate debt and could impact adversely our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets interest payments for borrowings on our credit facility the mortgages on certain properties and fixedtofloating interest rate swaps linked to two other properties are based on floating rates as a result an increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes including investments in our portfolio further rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures and increase interest costs on any debt that is refinanced we may from time to time enter into 18  agreements such as interest rate swaps caps floors and other interest rate hedging contracts currently the majority of our mortgages with floating rates are fully or partially hedged through the use of floatingtofixed interest rate swaps or interest rate caps and floors while these agreements may lessen the impact of rising interest rates they also expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to dispose of assets as part of our business strategy rating agency downgrades may increase our cost of capitalour senior notes are rated by moodys investors service standard amp poors ratings services and fitch ratings these independent rating agencies may elect to downgrade their ratings on our senior notes at any time such downgrades may affect negatively our access to the capital markets and increase our cost of capital our expenses may not decrease if our revenue decreases many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels such as debtservice payments property taxes insurance utilities and employee wages and benefits are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in revenue at the hotels our expenses also will be affected by inflationary increases and certain costs such as wages benefits and insurance may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period in the event of a significant decrease in demand our hotel managers may not be able to reduce the size of hotel work forces in order to decrease wages and benefits our managers also may be unable to offset any such increased expenses with higher room rates any of our efforts to reduce operating costs or failure to make scheduled capital expenditures also could adversely affect the future growth of our business and the value of our hotel properties our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations as part of our business strategy we seek primarily to acquire luxury and upper upscale hotel properties we may acquire properties through various structures including transactions involving portfolios single assets joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits or similar real estate entities we anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods including proceeds from host inc equity offerings issuance of limited partnership interests of host lp advances under our credit facility the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness and proceeds from the sales of assets to the extent there are disruptions in credit markets it may limit our ability to finance acquisitions and may limit the ability of purchasers to finance hotels and therefore our ability to use disposition proceeds to finance acquisitions we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions we may not achieve the value we anticipate from new hotel developments or value enhancement projects at our existing hotelswe currently are and in the future may be involved in the development of hotel properties timeshare units or other alternate uses of portions of our existing properties including the development of retail office or apartments including through joint ventures there are risks inherent in any new development includingwe may not obtain the zoning occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations necessary to complete the development a delay in receiving these approvals could affect adversely the returns we expect to receive any new construction involves the possibility of construction delays and cost overruns that may increase project costsdefects in design or construction may result in delays and additional costs to remedy the defect or require a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the defectwe may not be able to meet the loan covenants in any financing obtained to fund the new development creating default risks the development of timeshare units could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for residential fractional or interval ownership increases in mortgage rates andor decreases in mortgage availability market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell the timeshares for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate 19  in addition to the extent that developments are conducted through joint ventures this creates additional risks including the possibility that our partners may not meet their financial obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours see we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts any of the above factors could affect adversely our and our partners ability to complete the developments on schedule and along the scope that currently is contemplated or to achieve the intended value of these projects for these reasons there can be no assurances as to the value to be realized by the company from these transactions or any future similar transactionswe do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels to maintain our status as a reit we are not permitted to operate any of our hotels as a result we have entered into management agreements with thirdparty managers to operate our hotel properties for this reason we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of our hotels such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates repositioning of a hotel food and beverage pricing and certain similar matters although we consult with our hotel operators with respect to strategic business plans the hotel operators are under no obligation to implement any of our recommendations with respect to these matters while we monitor the hotel managers performance we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately the cash flow from our hotels may be affected adversely if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name because our management agreements are long term agreements we also may not be able to terminate these agreements if we believe the manager is not performing adequately from time to time we have had and continue to have differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements we generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations however if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to thirdparty dispute resolution failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements or the failure of our managers to adequately manage the risks associated with hotel operations including cybersecurity risks could affect adversely our results of operations in addition our hotel managers or their affiliates manage and in some cases own have invested in or provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete with our hotels all of which may result in conflicts of interest as a result our hotel managers have in the past made and may in the future make decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest we are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor our thirdparty managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our consolidated hotels other than employing but not managing associates at our properties in brazil new zealand and australia we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force particularly those hotels with unionized labor from time to time hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes lockouts public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity we also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes involving our thirdparty managers and their labor force or other events the resolution of labor disputes or renegotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs a significant component of our hotel operating costs either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs as we are not the employer nor bound by any collective bargaining agreement we do not negotiate with any labor organization and it is the responsibility of each propertys manager to enter into such labor contracts our ability if any to have any material impact on the outcome of these negotiations is restricted by and dependent on the individual management agreement covering a specific property and we may have little ability to control the outcome of these negotiationsour hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive in the marketplace maintain brand standards or to comply with applicable laws or regulations the timing and costs of such renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments we are required by our loan agreements or agreements with our hotel managers to make agreed upon capital expenditures in addition we will need to make further capital expenditures in order to remain competitive with other hotels to maintain the economic value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations the timing of these improvements can affect hotel performance particularly if the improvements require closure of a significant number of rooms or other features of the hotels such as ballrooms meeting space and restaurants these capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost overruns and delays in addition because we depend on external sources of capital we may not have the necessary funds to invest and if we fail to maintain our properties in accordance with brand standards set by our managers the manager may 20  terminate the management agreement moreover we may not necessarily realize a significant or any improvement in the performance of the hotels in which we make these investments the ownership of hotels outside the united states and the expansion of our business into new markets outside of the united states will expose us to risks related to owning hotels in those international markets part of our business strategy is to expand our presence outside of the united states as of december 31 2013 we own directly 15 hotels located outside of the united states we also are party to a joint venture that owns 19 hotels in europe and to a joint venture that owns one hotel in australia and a noncontrolling interest in two hotels currently open and five hotels in development in india we may have difficulty managing our expansion into new geographic markets where we have limited knowledge and understanding of the local economy an absence of business relationships in the area or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures and regulations there are risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states which include employment laws and practices tax laws which may provide for income or other taxes or tax rates that exceed those of the us and which may provide that foreign earnings that are repatriated directly or indirectly are subject to dividend withholding tax requirements or other restrictions and which may affect our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a tax efficient manner compliance with and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy the willingness of domestic or international lenders to provide financing and changes in the availability cost and terms of such financing adverse changes in local political economic and market conditions insurance coverage related to terrorist events changes in interest rates andor currency exchange rates and difficulties in hedging these risks regulations regarding the incurrence of debtdifficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries and difficulties in complying with us rules governing reits while operating outside of the united states any of these factors could affect adversely our ability to obtain all of the intended benefits of our international country expansion if we do not effectively manage this expansion and successfully integrate the international hotels into our organization our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts we have made investments in joint ventures and are exploring further investment opportunities in the united states asia europe and latin america we may from time to time invest as a coventurer in other entities holding hotel properties instead of purchasing hotel properties directly we also may sell interests in existing properties to a third party as part of forming a joint venture with such third party investments in joint ventures may involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions coventurers often share control over the operation of a joint venture actions by a coventurer also could subject the assets to additional risks as a result of any of the following circumstances our coventurer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our or the joint ventures interests or goals or our coventurer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives although generally we will seek to maintain sufficient control of any joint venture in order to permit our objectives to be achieved we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers from focusing their time and effort on our business our management agreements could affect the sale or financing of our hotelsunder the terms of our management agreements we generally may not sell lease or otherwise transfer our hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other 21  conditions our ability to finance or sell our properties depending upon the structure of such transactions may require the managers consent if the manager does not consent to such sale or financing we may be precluded from taking actions in our best interest we may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance program for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts and neither u s nor foreign terrorism insurance laws or regulations ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future we generally obtain terrorism insurance to cover property damage caused by acts of terrorism under separate standalone policies of insurance as well as policies on us properties which currently are subject to us federal government cost sharing as provided in the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act tripra we also have terrorism insurance under our general liability program and in our program for directors and officers coverage we also obtain terrorism insurance to cover some of our foreign properties through insurance programs involving or administered by foreign governments we may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance policies for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts and neither us nor foreign terrorism insurance legislation or regulations ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future tripra is due to expire on december 31 2014 there is no assurance that terrorism insurance will be readily available or affordable before or after expiration of tripra in december 2014 or that tripra will not be modified repealed or allowed to expirewhile tripra allows direct insurers to be reimbursed for certain losses they incur on us properties resulting from nuclear biological chemical and radiological nbcr perils tripra does not require insurers to offer coverage for these perils and to date insurers are not willing to provide this coverage even with government reimbursement any damage related to war and to nbcr incidents therefore is excluded under policies covering our us properties moreover many of our foreign properties are not covered against nbcr perils we obtain a certain amount of property insurance coverage on our us properties for nbcr perils through our whollyowned subsidiary that acts as our direct insurer against such perils to the extent of reimbursement under tripra we ultimately are responsible for any loss borne by our insurance subsidiary as a result of the above there remains uncertainty regarding the adequacy and cost of terrorism coverage that will be available to protect our interests in the event of terrorist attacks that impact our properties some potential losses are not covered by insurance we or our hotel managers carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability property business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties these policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar types of properties generally our allrisk property policies provide coverage that is available on a peroccurrence basis and that for each occurrence has an overall limit as well as various sublimits on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive sublimits exist for certain types of claims such as service interruption debris removal expediting costs landscaping replacement and natural disasters such as earthquakes floods and hurricanes and may be subject to annual aggregate coverage limits the dollar amounts of these sublimits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit in this regard hotels in certain of our markets including california florida and new zealand have in the past been and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters recovery under the applicable policies also is subject to substantial deductibles and complex calculations of lost business income there is no assurance that this insurance where maintained will fully fund the rebuilding or restoration of a hotel that is impacted by an earthquake hurricane or other natural disaster or the income lost as a result of the damage our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined together for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sublimits contained in our policies have been exceeded and in the case where the manager of one of our hotels provides this coverage any such claims will be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the managers program for the same purpose therefore if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels or in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by the manager affects hotels owned by others the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sublimits depending on the type of claim have been reached each affected hotel only may receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available we may incur losses in excess of insured limits and as a result we may be even less likely to receive complete coverage for risks that affect multiple properties such as earthquakes hurricanes or certain types of terrorism in addition there are other risks such as certain environmental hazards that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify coverage we also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier we could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel in that event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 22  litigation judgments or settlements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition we have accrued a potential litigation loss of approximately 68 million in connection with a lawsuit in the 166th judicial district court of bexar county texas involving the sale of land encumbered by a ground lease for the san antonio marriott rivercenter see part i item 3 legal proceedings for more information on the verdict and the status of the appeal we also are involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business and are vigorously defending these claims however no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings we believe based on currently available information that the results of such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but might be material to our operating results for any particular period depending in part upon the operating results for such period we also could become the subject of future claims by the operators of our hotels individuals or companies who use our hotels our investors our joint venture partners or regulating entities and these claims could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and performance we may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities related to hotels or businesses we acquire assets and entities that we have acquired or may in the future acquire may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse or only limited recourse against the sellers in general the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements may not survive long enough for us to become aware of such liabilities and seek recourse against our sellers while usually we require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive such indemnification often is limited and subject to various materiality thresholds a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses as a result there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with acquired hotels and entities may exceed our expectations plus we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects all of which may affect adversely our revenues expenses operating results and financial condition finally indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the assets and entities acquired by us while the sellers generally are contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities without regard to survival limitations materiality thresholds deductibles or caps on losses there can be no guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses in addition to those incurred by the sellers we depend on our key personnelour success depends on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel none of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers we cannot assure you that these key personnel will remain employed by us while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our financial performance exchange rate fluctuations could affect adversely our financial results as a result of the expansion of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the euro the canadian dollar the mexican peso the australian dollar the new zealand dollar the british pound sterling the polish zloty swedish krona the brazilian real and the chilean peso although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of these and other foreign currencies these transactions if entered into will not eliminate that risk entirely to the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in the same currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate revenues or earnings in other currencies the conversion of such amounts to us dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our revenues or earnings applicable reit laws may restrict certain business activities as a reit host inc is subject to various restrictions on the types of income it can earn assets it can own and activities in which it can engage business activities that could be restricted by applicable reit laws include but are not limited to activities such as developing alternative uses of real estate including the development andor sale of timeshare or condominium units due to these restrictions we anticipate that we will conduct certain business activities including those mentioned above in one or more of our taxable reit subsidiaries our taxable reit subsidiaries are taxable as regular c corporations and are subject to federal state local and if applicable foreign taxation on their taxable income 23  we may be unable to sell properties because real estate investments are inherently illiquid real estate properties generally cannot be sold quickly and accordingly we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions the inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could affect adversely our financial condition and the ability to service our debt in addition under the federal income tax laws applicable to reits we may be limited in our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets our ground lease payments may increase faster than the revenues we receive from the hotels located on the leased ground as of december 31 2013 36 of our hotels are subject to thirdparty ground leases encumbering all or a portion of the hotel these ground leases generally require periodic increases in ground rent payments which often are based on economic indicators such as the consumer price index our ability to pay ground rent could be affected adversely to the extent that our hotel revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases in addition if we were to sell a hotel encumbered by a ground lease the buyer would be required to assume the ground lease which may result in a lower sales price environmental problems are possible and can be costly we believe that our properties comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws unidentified environmental liabilities could arise however and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance additionally even after we have sold a property we may be liable for environmental liabilities that occurred during our ownership federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property the owner or operator may be required to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site environmental laws also govern the presence maintenance and removal of toxic or hazardous substances these laws require that owners or operators of buildings properly manage and maintain these substances and notify and train those who may come into contact with them and undertake special precautions these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to toxic or hazardous materials compliance with other government regulations can be costly our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation including title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons these laws and regulations may be changed from timetotime or new regulations adopted resulting in additional costs of compliance including potential litigation for example the ada was revised substantially in september 2010 and our facilities were required to comply with the new regulations by march 15 2012 a determination that we are not in compliance with the ada could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance imposition of fines or an award of attorneys fees to private litigants compliance with the ada and other laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the operations of our international properties are subject to a variety of united states and international laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws but we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international properties might be subject and the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted24  risks of ownership of host incs common stock there are limitations on the acquisition of host inc common stock and changes in control host incs charter and

purchase plan and 07 million outstanding options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of 1541 per share also as of december 31 2013 host lp had outstanding 400 million principal amount of exchangeable senior debentures that currently are exchangeable for cash shares of host incs common stock or any combination thereof assuming the holders elected to exchange and we elected to settle in shares of host inc common stock the debentures would be exchangeable for approximately 299 million shares based on the current exchange price while these debentures currently are exchangeable through march 31 2014 based on past trading prices of host inc common stock whether they remain exchangeable after march 31 2014 will depend on then current trading prices of host inc common stockour earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of host incs common stock we believe that the market value of a reits equity securities is based primarily upon the markets perception of the reits growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions whether from operations sales acquisitions development or refinancings and secondarily is based upon the value of the underlying assets for that reason shares of host incs common stock 26  may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may impact negatively the market price of host incs common stock our failure to meet the markets expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would affect adversely the market price of host incs common stock market interest rates may affect the price of shares of host incs common stock we believe that one of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a reit is the dividend rate on the shares considered as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of reit shares may expect a higher dividend rate thus higher market interest rates could cause the market price of host incs common stock to decrease federal income tax risks to qualify as a reit each of host inc and its subsidiary reits are required to distribute at least 90 of its taxable income excluding net capital gain regardless of available cash or outstanding obligations to continue to qualify as a reit host inc is required to distribute to its stockholders with respect to each year at least 90 of its taxable income excluding net capital gain to the extent that host inc satisfies this distribution requirement but distributes less than 100 of its taxable income and net capital gain for the taxable year it will be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition host inc will be subject to a nondeductible 4 excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by host inc with respect to the calendar year are less than the sum of 1 85 of its ordinary income 2 95 of its net capital gain and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior years less excess distributions from prior years host inc intends to make distributions subject to the availability of cash and in compliance with any debt covenants to its stockholders in order to comply with the distribution requirement and to avoid the imposition of a significant nondeductible 4 excise tax and will rely for this purpose on distributions from host lp and its subsidiaries there are differences in timing between host incs recognition of taxable income and its receipt of cash available for distribution due to among other things the seasonality of the lodging industry and the fact that some taxable income will be phantom taxable income which is taxable income that is not matched with cash flow due to transactions entered into in years prior to host incs conversion to a reit host inc could recognize substantial amounts of phantom taxable income in the future it is possible that any differences between the recognition of taxable income and the receipt of the related cash could require us to borrow funds or for host inc to issue additional equity in order to enable host inc to meet its distribution requirements and therefore to maintain its reit status and to avoid the nondeductible 4 excise tax in addition because the reit distribution requirements prevent host inc from retaining earnings generally we will be required to refinance debt at its maturity with additional debt or equity it is possible that any of these sources of funds if available at all would not be sufficient to meet host incs distribution and tax obligations host lp owns 100 of the outstanding common stock and a portion of the outstanding preferred stock of two entities that have elected to be treated as reits each of these subsidiary reits are subject to the same requirements that host inc must satisfy in order to qualify as a reit including the distribution requirements described above adverse tax consequences would occur if host inc or any of its subsidiary reits fail to qualify as a reit we believe that host inc has been organized and has operated in such a manner so as to qualify as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year beginning january 1 1999 and host inc currently intends to continue to operate as a reit during future years in addition host inc owns through host lp two entities that have elected to be treated as reits as the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a reit are limited no assurance can be provided that host inc currently qualifies as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit or that each of host incs subsidiary reits qualify as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit if any of the subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit it is possible that host inc would fail to qualify as a reit unless it or the subsidiary reit could avail itself of certain relief provisions new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change significantly the tax laws with respect to an entitys qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of its reit qualification if host inc or any of its subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit and any available relief provisions did not apply the nonqualifying reit would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates moreover unless entitled to statutory relief the nonqualifying reit would not qualify as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which reit qualification was lost any determination that host inc or one of its subsidiary reits does not qualify as a reit will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce materially the value of host incs common stock the additional tax liability of host 27  inc or the subsidiary reit for the year or years in which the relevant entity did not qualify as a reit would reduce its net earnings available for investment debt service or distributions to stockholders furthermore the nonqualifying entity no longer would be required to make distributions to its stockholders as a condition to reit qualification and all of its distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary c corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that if host inc were to fail to qualify as a reit host incs stockholders currently taxed as individuals would be taxed on those dividends at capital gain rates and host incs corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the code host incs failure to qualify as a reit also would cause an event of default under host lps credit facility which default could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due thereunder which in turn would constitute an event of default under host lps outstanding debt securities if our leases are not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes each of host inc and its subsidiary reits would fail to qualify as a reit to qualify as a reit host inc must satisfy two gross income tests pursuant to which specified percentages of its gross income must be passive income such as rent for the rent paid pursuant to the hotel leases with our trs which rental income currently constitutes substantially all of host incs and each of our subsidiary reits gross income to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests our leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and must not be treated as service contracts joint ventures or some other type of arrangement we believe that the leases will be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance however that the internal revenue service irs will agree with this characterization if the leases were not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes neither host inc nor either of our subsidiary reits would be able to satisfy either of the two gross income tests applicable to reits and each likely would lose its reit status if our affiliated lessees fail to qualify as taxable reit subsidiaries each of host inc and its subsidiary reits would fail to qualify as a reit rent paid by a lessee that is a related party tenant of host inc will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to reits we lease substantially all of our hotels to our subsidiary or its affiliates that is taxable as a regular c corporation and that has elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary with respect to host inc and to each subsidiary reit so long as any affiliated lessee qualifies as a taxable reit subsidiary it will not be treated as a related party tenant we believe that our affiliated lessees have qualified and will continue to qualify and that the taxable reit subsidiaries of each of our subsidiary reits have qualified and will continue to qualify to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance however that the irs will not challenge the status of a taxable reit subsidiary for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in disqualifying any of our affiliated lessees including the taxable reit subsidiaries of our subsidiary reits from treatment as a taxable reit subsidiary it is possible that host inc or a subsidiary reit would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to reits and substantially all of its income would fail to qualify for the gross income tests if host inc or a subsidiary reit failed to meet either the asset tests or the gross income tests each likely would lose its reit status despite the reit status of each of host inc and its subsidiary reits we remain subject to various taxes one of the subsidiary reits of host inc will be required to pay federal income tax at the highest regular corporate rate on builtin gain recognized as a result of the sale of one or more of its hotels prior to the expiration of the applicable 10year holding period including certain hotels acquired from starwood and its affiliates in 2006 the total amount of gain on which the subsidiary reit would be subject to corporate income tax if all of its builtin gain assets were sold in a taxable transaction prior to the expiration of the applicable 10year holding period would be material to it recently enacted legislation however has reduced the 10year period to five years in the case of dispositions of assets in 2012 or 2013 in addition we expect that we could recognize other substantial deferred tax liabilities in the future without any corresponding receipt of cash notwithstanding host incs status as a reit host inc and our subsidiaries including our subsidiary reits are subject to federal state local and foreign taxes on their income and property in certain cases for example host inc and our subsidiary reits will pay tax on certain types of income that are not distributed and will be subject to a 100 excise tax on transactions with a taxable reit subsidiary that are not conducted on an arms length basis moreover the taxable reit subsidiaries of host inc and our subsidiary reits are taxable as regular c corporations and will pay federal state and local income tax on their net income at the applicable corporate rates and foreign taxes to the extent that they own assets or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions host lp is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes and any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc 28  if the irs were to challenge successfully host lps status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes host inc would cease to qualify as a reit and would suffer other adverse consequences we believe that host lp qualifies to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership it is not subject to federal income tax on its income instead each of its partners including host inc is required to report and pay tax if applicable on such partners allocable share of its income no assurance can be provided however that the irs will not challenge host lps status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating host lp as a corporation for federal income tax purposes host inc would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to reits and accordingly would cease to qualify as a reit if host lp fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or host inc fails to qualify as a reit either failure would cause an event of default under host lps credit facility that in turn could constitute an event of default under host lps outstanding debt securities also the failure of host lp to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes would cause it to become subject to federal state and foreign corporate income tax which tax would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners including host inc as a reit each of host inc and its subsidiary reits is subject to limitations on its ownership of debt and equity securities subject to certain exceptions a reit generally is prohibited from owning securities in any one issuer to the extent that 1 the value of such securities exceeds 5 of the value of the reits total assets 2 the securities owned by the reit represent more than 10 of the issuers outstanding voting securities or 3 the reit owns more than 10 of the value of the issuers outstanding securities a reit is permitted to own securities of a subsidiary in an amount that exceeds the 5 value test and the 10 vote or value test if the subsidiary elects to be a taxable reit subsidiary however a reit may not own securities of taxable reit subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 25 of the value of the reits total assets if host inc or any of its subsidiary reits were to violate these ownership limitations each likely would lose its reit status each of host inc or its subsidiary reits may be required to pay a penalty tax upon the sale of a hotel the federal income tax provisions applicable to reits provide that any gain realized by a reit from the sale of property held as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100 excise tax under existing law whether property including hotels is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is a question of fact that depends upon all of the facts and circumstances with respect to the particular transaction we intend to hold our hotels for investment with a view to longterm appreciation to engage in the business of acquiring and owning hotels and to make occasional sales of hotels consistent with our investment objectives there can be no assurance however that the irs might not contend that one or more of these sales are subject to the 100 excise tax risks relating to redemption of op units a holder who offers its op units for redemption may have adverse tax consequencesa holder whose op units are redeemed will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as having sold the op units the sale of these units is a taxable event and the holder thereof will be treated as realizing an amount equal to the sum of 1 the value of the common stock or cash the holder receives and 2 the amount of host lps nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units the gain or loss recognized by the holder of op units is measured by the difference between the amount realized by the holder and the holders tax basis in the op units redeemed which tax basis includes the amount of host lps nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units it is possible that the amount of gain andor the tax liability related thereto that the holder recognizes and pays could exceed the value of the common stock or cash that the holder receives differences between an investment in shares of host inc common stock and host lp op units may affect redeemed holders of op unitsif a holder of op units elects to have its units redeemed we will determine whether the holder receives cash or shares of host incs common stock in exchange for the op units although an investment in shares of host incs common stock is substantially similar to an investment in host lp op units there are some differences these differences include form of organization management structure voting rights liquidity and federal and state income taxation some of which differences may be material to investors 29

lawsuit against keystonetexas property holding corporation keystone seeking a declaration that a provision of the ground lease for the property under the san antonio marriott rivercenter was valid and claiming that keystone had breached that lease provision on october 18 2006 keystone filed an amended counterclaim and later a third party claim alleging that we had tortiously interfered with keystones attempted sale of the property and that we slandered keystones title to the property on february 8 2010 we received an adverse jury verdict in the 166th judicial district court of bexar county texas the jury found that we tortiously interfered with the attempted sale by keystone of the land under the san antonio marriott rivercenter and awarded keystone 343 million in damages plus statutory interest in addition the jury found that we slandered keystones title to the property and awarded keystone 39 million in damages plus statutory interest keystone only will be entitled to receive one of these damage awards on february 12 2010 the jury awarded keystone 75 million in exemplary damages with respect to the second claim the trial court however subsequently granted our motion to disregard the jurys exemplary damages award on june 3 2010 the trial court issued its final judgment awarding keystone i 39 million in damages for slander of title or alternatively 343

disregard the jurys 75 million award of exemplary damages on january 17 2012 we filed motions seeking rehearing from the threejudge panel and a motion for rehearing by the entire sevenjudge court of appeals those motions were denied on february 29 2012 on may 16 2012 we filed a petition for review in the texas supreme court and on august 17 2012 the court requested briefing on the merits briefing concluded in january 2013 on june 28 2013 the court issued an order denying the petition for review however on december 13 2013 the court granted our motion for rehearing on that order and heard oral

funded a courtordered 25 million escrow reserve for this legal proceeding we also are involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business and are vigorously defending these

and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report overview host inc operates as a selfmanaged and selfadministered reit that owns properties and conducts operations through host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and in which it holds approximately 987 of its common op units as of december 31 2013 the remainder of host lps common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lps daytoday management and control host inc is the largest lodging reit in nareits composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotel properties as of february 14 2014 we own 114 hotels in the united states and internationally and have minority ownership interests in an additional 24 hotels through joint ventures in the united states europe and the asiapacific region these hotels are primarily operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry the majority are located in central business districts of major cities near airports and in resortconference destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors since 2002 the percentage of revenues from our target markets has increased from approximately 55 to 75 in 2013 as we have focused our acquisition efforts on these locations and similarly disposed of noncore assets while hotels in these markets still are subject to competitive pressures we believe this strategy of combining premium brands with superior locations provides opportunities to achieve room rate and occupancy premiums in excess of our competitors our customers the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient business group business and contract business which accounted for approximately 60 35 and 5 respectively of our 2013 room sales similar to the majority of the lodging industry we further categorize business within these broad groups based on characteristics they have in common as follows transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels therefore we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than trends in leisure demand the four key subcategories of the transient business group are retail this is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the general public it typically is the rate charged to travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discounted rates it includes the rack rate which typically is applied to rooms during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available retail room rates will fluctuate more freely depending on anticipated demand levels eg seasonality and weekday vs weekend stays nonqualified discount these include special rates offered by the hotels including packages advancepurchase discounts and promotional offers these also include rooms booked through online travel agencies otas special corporate this is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally these rates typically are negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated retail rate in addition this category includes rates offered at the prevailing per diem for approved government travelqualified discount this category encompasses all discount programs such as aaa and aarp discounts rooms booked through wholesale channels frequent guest program redemptions and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together usually with a minimum of 10 rooms the three key subcategories of the group business category are association group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions corporate group business related to corporate meetings eg product launches training programs contract negotiations and presentations other group business predominately related to social military education religious fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams otherwise known as smerf business contract business refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our airport hotels additionally contract rates may be utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand 37  understanding our performance our revenues and expenses our hotels are operated by thirdparty managers under longterm agreements pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel we provide operating funds or working capital which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages utilities property taxes and other hotellevel expenses we generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month which distribution reflects hotellevel sales less propertylevel operating expenses excluding depreciation revenue from owned hotels represents 99 of our total revenue the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue          of 2013revenues        rooms revenue occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue the business mix of the hotel group versus transient and retail versus discount business is a significant driver of room rates   64                   food and beverage revenue food amp beverage revenues consist of revenues from group functions which may include both banquet revenue and audio and visual revenues as well as outlet revenues from the restaurants and lounges at our properties   29                   other revenue occupancy the nature of the property eg resort etc and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue such as parking golf course spa entertainment and other guest services   6   hotel operating expenses represent approximately 97 of our total operating costs and expenses the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses          of 2013operatingcosts andexpenses        rooms expense these costs include housekeeping reservation systems room supplies laundry services and front desk costs occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages as well as on the level of service and amenities that are provided   19                    food and beverage expense these expenses primarily include food beverage and the associated labor costs and will correlate closely with food and beverage revenues group functions with banquet sales and audio and visual components will generally have lower overall costs as a percentage of revenues than outlet sales   23                    other departmental and support expenses these expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenue such as parking golf courses spas entertainment and other guest services as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments sales and marketing repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs   27                    management fees base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels   5                    other propertylevel expenses these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes ground rent equipment rent and property insurance many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenue at our hotels   8                    depreciation and amortization expense this is a noncash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of past capital expenditures   15    the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations it also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items taken separately these costs represent approximately 55 of our hotel operating expenses key performance indicators revenue per available room revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily 38  occupancy achieved revpar does not include food and beverage parking or other guest service revenues generated by the property although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues it is considered the key indicator of core revenues for many hotels revpar changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels as well as incremental operating profit than do changes that are driven by average room rate for example increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues such as food and beverage revenue as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services utilities and room amenity costs revpar increases due to higher room rates however will not result in additional roomrelated costs with the exception of those charged as a percentage of revenue as a result changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in revpar caused by occupancy levels in discussing our operating results we present revpar and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and which operations have been included in our consolidated results comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage or large scale capital improvements we also present revpar separately for our comparable consolidated domestic and international both on a nominal and constant dollar basis hotels as well as for our joint venture in europe we provide revpar results in constant currency due to the number of consolidated properties we have internationally and the effect that exchange rates have on our reporting we use constant currency because we believe it is useful to investors because it provides clarity on how the hotels are performing in their local markets for all other measures net income operating profit ebitda ffo etc our discussion is only in nominal us which is consistent with our financial statement presentation under gaapwe also evaluate the performance of our business through certain nongaap financial measures each of these nongaap financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues operating profit net income and earnings per share we provide a more detailed discussion of these nongaap financial measures how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in nongaap financial measures our nongaap financial measures include nareit funds from operations ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share we use nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share as supplemental measures of companywide profitability nareit adopted ffo in order to promote an industrywide measure of reit operating performance we also adjust nareit ffo for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt acquisition costs and litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business hotel adjusted operating profit and margins hotel adjusted operating profit measures propertylevel results before debt service depreciation and corporate expenses and is a supplemental measure of aggregate propertylevel profitability we use hotel adjusted operating profit and associated margins to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels ebitda and adjusted ebitda earnings before income taxes interest expense depreciation and amortization ebitda is a supplemental measure of the operating performance of our properties and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits hotel owners who are not reits and other capitalintensive companies we also adjust ebitda for gains and losses related to real estate transactions impairment losses and litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business adjusted ebitda 39

statistics for 2012 and 2011 are based on 103 comparable hotels as of december 31 2012 2for a discussion of our constant us and nominal us presentation see comparable hotel operating statisticsin 2013 on a constant us basis revpar at our comparable hotels increased 58 compared to 2012 marking the fourth straight year of comparable revpar growth in excess of 55 while the overall growth in the economy since the 20082009 recession has been slow particularly with regards to gdp growth and the level of unemployment specific drivers of lodging demand have proven to be more resilient in particular corporate business which is one of the most important demand drivers of our portfolio has strengthened as corporate profits and business investment have increased at a much greater rate than the overall economy additionally our domestic target markets have benefited from an increase in demand from travel to the us as international arrivals increased on a constant us basis revpar at our comparable consolidated international hotels increased 39 in 2013 the increase reflects improvement in average room rate in all of our consolidated international markets largely offset by a decrease in occupancy of 56 percentage points at our properties in latin america which was negatively affected by ongoing construction at the jw marriott hotel mexico city revpar growth in 2013 at our comparable hotels was both rate and occupancy driven as room rates improved 42 on a nominal us basis and occupancy improved 100 basis points to 76 which is above our prerecession occupancy levels in 2007 our operators have been able to leverage the higher occupancy levels in order to gradually increase room rates particularly for our transient business therefore much of the room revenue improvement for the year was driven by improvement in transient demand as 40  transient revenue increased 75 benefiting from an increase in occupancy and a positive mix shift to higher rated business and group revenue increased 26 food and beverage revenues at our comparable hotels increased 40 for 2013 the increase was driven primarily by a positive mix shift to banquet and audio visual revenues which provide higher overall operating margins than outlet revenue as catered functions generally are more profitable additionally outlet revenue increased particularly in the second half of the year as a result of strategic efforts to drive food and beverage profitability by renovating and repositioning restaurants at certain of our properties food and beverage revenue has significantly benefited from restaurant repositionings and renovations completed over the past three years overall food and beverage revenues increased by 59 compared to 2012 in aggregate revenues for our owned hotels increased 327 million to 51 billion for the year while other revenues decreased 220 million the decline in other revenues was due to the expiration of the lease on the 53 courtyard by marriott hotels leased from hospitality properties trust hpt on december 31 2012 accordingly total revenues increased 107 million to approximately 52 billion for 2013 operating margins calculated based on gaap operating profit as a percentage of gaap revenues increased 270 basis points for the full year 2013 these operating margins are affected significantly by several items including operations from recently acquired hotels depreciation impairments and corporate expenses our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins which exclude these items increased 100 basis points to 255 the improvements were driven by the increase in average room rate as well as a 79 increase in comparable food and beverage profit net income for host inc improved 262 million in 2013 to 325 million net income benefited from the improvement in operating profit as well as a decrease in interest expense of 69 million due to the repayment or refinancing of debt at lower interest rates a decrease in impairment expense of 59 million and an increase in gains on hotel dispositions of 49 million adjusted ebitda which is defined as ebitda adjusted for gains and losses related to real estate transactions impairment expense and other items increased 116 million or 97 to 13 billionduring 2013 host incs diluted income per common share improved 034 per share to 042 per common share the improvement in our income per diluted share reflects the improvement in operating results at our hotels as described above host incs adjusted ffo per diluted share increased 191 to 131 per diluted share for 2013 the trends and transactions described above for host inc affected similarly the operating results for host lp as the only significant difference between the host inc and host lp statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the outside partners of host lp for the year host lps net income improved 262 million to 325 million and the diluted income per common unit improved 034 per common unit to 043 per common unit 2014 outlook we believe that the broad economic trends that have translated into the steady improvement in lodging demand should continue in 2014 in the united states according to blue chip economic indicators the consensus estimate for real gdp growth in 2014 currently is 28 this growth rate is a notable increase over 2013 due to an improved outlook surrounding private sector demand and consumer sentiment as well as business investment and international travel which are particularly important indicators of demand at properties located in our targeted gateway markets additionally significant impediments to growth due to governmental fiscal policy in 2013 such as the federal government shutdown in the fourth quarter uncertainty due to the threat of the potential us credit default and austerity efforts at the state and local levels are not expected to repeat or to have the same negative yearoveryear effect for 2014 at the same time however certain key factors continue to affect negatively the economic recovery and add to general market uncertainty these factors include but are not limited to continued political uncertainty with respect to us economic policy including the potential effects of the tapering of the bondbuying program by the federal reserve continued high levels of unemployment the tenuous nature of the euro zone recovery the slowdown in growth in china and slower growth and elevated risks associated with emerging markets as a result of these economic trends we believe the overall improvement in the economic climate will result in a steady increase in demand for our domestic portfolio during 2014in europe we expect moderate demand growth consistent with the slowly improving economic climate for the euro jv properties we anticipate that this moderate demand growth will lead to modest improvements in revpar our properties in latin america are expected to exhibit solid revpar improvement as rio de janeiro will benefit from increased leisure demand generated by the fifa world cup in the asiapacific region we expect that our properties in australia and new zealand will exhibit moderate growth in revpar as the increases in new supply will be low 41  over the same period we have experienced relatively low supply growth in upper upscale hotels in most of our target markets due to the long planning cycle of hotel development projects lack of available credit in prior years and the pricing of upper upscale hotels which have continued to trade below replacement cost as a result demand has exceeded supply growth in the industry overall we expect this trend to continue into 2014 with the exception of the new york and washington dc markets where supply growth is expected to exceed the historical industry average during 2014 as a result of these trends we continue to believe that the strong overall fundamentals in the lodging industry should drive improvements in revpar growth and operating results specifically based on our current group bookings we believe there is the potential for increasing group demand which would allow our operators to shift the business mix to higherrated corporate group and transient demand as opposed to lowerrated transient discount business as a result we believe the majority of the revpar growth for 2014 will be driven by improvements in average rate as we expect occupancy growth will be similar to that experienced in 2013 for the full year 2014 we believe these trends will result in improved operating performance and comparable hotel revpar growth on a constant us basis of 5 to 6 we anticipate that comparable food and beverage and other revenue will increase approximately 3 to 4 in 2014 driven in part by the expected increase in group demandwhile we believe that the lodging industry will continue to improve there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons including but not limited to slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns see part i item 1a risk factorsinvesting activities acquisitions and development we continue to seek investment opportunities in our target markets which we have identified as those that are expected to have the greatest lodging demand growth the fewest additions to supply and the strongest potential for revenue growth we see increased competition for acquisitions in our target markets due to the accessibility of

constant us and nominal us presentation see comparable hotel operating statistics2the 2012 results include one additional day of operations in february compared to 2013 due to the leap year in 2012  for 2013 our top performing markets were houston seattle and san francisco with revpar increases of 151 109 and 102 respectively the increase in our houston market primarily resulted from higher average room rates as these hotels shifted from lowerrated group and transient business to higherrated segments as well as aggressive pricing increases in group for both retail and special corporate business the increase in our seattle market reflects a 67 increase in average room rate and a 30 percentage point increase in average occupancy driven by higherrated group and transient demand revpar growth in our san francisco market 48  was driven entirely by rate improvements from an improved business mix occupancy declined slightly during the year but still remained at over 80 as strong transient and group demand throughout the city have translated to revpar gains at our properties revpar for our atlanta hotels increased 96 for 2013 reflecting a strong citywide and special event calendar during the year that drove group and transient demandfor 2013 our los angeles market revpar increased 78 primarily due to improved average room rates as a result of increased transient business driven by a mix shift to higherrated segments and increased corporate group businessfor 2013 our florida hotels increased revpar 73 as a result of a 54 increase in average room rate and 13 percentage point increase in average occupancy driven by strong leisure demandour boston market revpar increased 72 as a result of a 35 percentage point increase in average occupancy and a 24 increase in average room rate due to strong group performance and transient business due in part to major league baseballs playoff and world series events and the favorable 2012 comparisons related to hurricane sandy our new york hotels increased revpar 60 as a result of a 31 percentage point increase in average occupancy and a 22 increase in average room rate in 2012 revpar growth was negatively affected by hurricane sandy in the fourth quarter and renovation disruption at several of our new york hotels in 2013 revpar results have been tempered by supply growth in this marketfor 2013 our washington dc market revpar increased only 10 due to a 10 percentage point increase in average occupancy resulting from transient room nights for 2013 the sequestration and us federal government shutdown negatively impacted this market by lowering demand for government and related industry businessinternationally revpar in our asiapacific and canadian markets increased 81 and 65 respectively on a constant us basis for 2013 the increase at our asiapacific hotels resulted from a 48 increase in average room rate and a 25 percentage point increase in average occupancy driven by transient demand and the results of renovations completed in 2012 the improvement in revpar at our canadian hotels was primarily driven by an increase in average room rate revpar at our latin american properties decreased 19 on a constant us basis largely due to a decrease in occupancy the nominal revpar results of our international properties were negatively affected by the relative strength of

our property types see comparable hotel operating statistics for 2013 our suburban properties led the portfolio with a 71 increase in revpar as stable average occupancy levels at these properties have allowed operators to increase average daily room rates we believe strong demand that has led to high average occupancy and increasing rates in adjacent urban markets has contributed to an increase in demand at our suburban properties for 2013 our resortconference hotels experienced revpar growth of 67 driven by a 48 increase in average room rate and a 12 percentage point increase in average occupancy due to higher demand our urban properties experienced a revpar growth of 52 for 2013 as results were mixed throughout these markets strength in several of our west coast markets as well as our houston and atlanta markets were partially offset by weakness in our washington dc and philadelphia markets 49  hotel sales by business mix the majority of our customers fall into three broad categories transient group and contract business the information below is derived from business mix results from 102 comparable hotels for which 2013 and 2012 business mix information is available in 2013 overall revenue growth was due mainly to transient revenues improving 75 compared to the prior year consisting of a 40 average room rate increase coupled with a 34 growth in transient room nights sold the transient average room rate increase resulted from a combination of segment price increases and an increasingly favorable business mix higherrated retail and nonqualified discount transient room nights increased 91 for the year while lowerrated special corporate government and discount segments decreased 09 during 2013 group revenues increased 26 when compared to 2012 reflecting an increase in average room rate of 28 while group room nights sold declined 02 corporate and association group revenues increased 99 and 26 respectively while discount group revenue decreased 84 2012 compared to 2011 during 2012 total revenue increased 345 million or 73 primarily as a result of growth in room revenues reflecting an increase in revpar and growth in fampb revenues in addition revenues benefited from the acquisition of one hotel in july 2012 and a full year of operations for 10 hotels acquired in 2011 revenues for properties sold in 2012 or 2011 have been reclassified to discontinued operations rooms room revenues increased 233 million or 82 to 3082 million in 2012 due to strong growth in room rates coupled with a growth in average occupancy comparable hotel revpar

second half of the year as new and recently renovated restaurants performed well in addition fampb revenues for 2012 increased 31 million due to incremental revenues from recently acquired hotels other revenues from owned hotels during 2012 other revenues from owned hotels increased 8 million or 29 to 287 million the improvement primarily resulted from an increase in operating departments such as garage spa and golf partially offset by a decrease in gift shop revenue as well as 2 million in incremental revenues from recently acquired hotels other revenues other revenues increased 21 million or 84 to 271 million in 2012 the improvement was due to 5 million in retail lease revenue at the new york marriott marquis as a result of the new lease agreement with vornado realty trust as well as an increase of 12 million in revenues for hotels we leased from hpt 50  comparable hotel sales by geographic market the following table sets forth performance information for our comparable hotels by

operations due to the leap year 2for a discussion of our property types see comparable hotel operating statisticsduring 2012 comparable hotel revpar increased across all of our hotel property types our airport properties led the portfolio with a 90 increase for the year driven by an improvement in average room rates of 53 as well as strength at our san francisco chicago houston and tampa airport hotels our resortconference hotels also experienced a significant revpar increase of 86 led by our florida and hawaii properties our urban hotels slightly underperformed the portfolio due to renovation activity during the year and the effects of hurricane sandy in the fourth quarter hotel sales by business mix the information below is derived from business mix data for 103 of our hotels for which 2012 and 2011 business mix information is available in 2012 overall transient revenues increased 59 when compared to 2011 reflecting a 42 improvement in average room rate and a 16 increase in room nights during 2012 group revenues increased approximately 64 when compared to 2011 reflecting a 23 increase in average room rate and a 41 increase in room nights the improvement was due to

consist of both fixed and variable components are affected by a number of factors as previously discussed room expense is affected mainly by occupancy which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping reservation systems room supplies laundry services and front desk costs food and beverage expense correlates closely with food and beverage revenues and is affected by occupancy and the mix of business between banquet and audiovisual and outlet sales however the most significant expense for both room expense and food and beverage expense is related to wages and employee benefits which comprise approximately 55 of these expenses in any year other propertylevel expenses consist of property taxes which are highly dependent on local taxing authorities and property and general liability insurance and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels the overall increases in operating expenses in 2013 and 2012 are consistent with higher overall revenues at our properties the yearoveryear increases also reflect the incremental expenses from our recently acquired properties for 2013 the recently acquired properties include the hyatt place waikiki beach that was purchased in may 2013 and six months of incremental operations for the grand hyatt washington for 2012 the recently acquired properties include the grand hyatt washington that was purchased in july 2012 and a full year of operations for 10 hotels acquired in 2011 propertylevel operating expenses for hotels sold during the periods presented have been reclassified as discontinued operations rooms room expenses increased 58 million during 2013 reflecting an increase of 51 at our comparable hotels primarily driven by higher travel agent commissions and wages and benefit expenses additionally rooms expenses increased 12 million for 2013 due to incremental expenses from our recent acquisitions the increase in room expenses for 2012 reflects an increase of 55 at our comparable hotels as a result of higher average occupancy as well as higher wage rates and benefits rooms expenses for 2012 increased an incremental 19 million as a result of acquired hotels food and beverage fampb expenses increased 46 million during 2013 comparable fampb expenses increased just 27 as much of the revenue improvement was driven by increases in banquet and audio visual revenues which have higher overall operating margins than outlet revenue as a percentage of revenues fampb expenses decreased 100 basis points for our comparable hotels during 2013 fampb expenses also increased an incremental 13 million due to our recent acquisitions the increase in fampb expenses for 2012 was a result of a 36 increase at our comparable hotels reflecting higher wages and benefits partially offset by a slight improvement in productivity fampb expenses for 2012 also increased an incremental 21 million as a result of acquired hotels other departmental and support expenses other departmental and support expenses increased 30 million in 2013 primarily due to increases in loyalty program rewards wages and benefits and credit card expenses other departmental and support expenses for 2013 also included an incremental 13 million from our recent acquisitions for 2012 the increase in these expenses was driven primarily by higher sales and marketing expenses which are variable and dependent upon revenues such as loyalty rewards expense and national sales allocations these increases partially were offset by lower centralized accounting charges and lower utility rates and consumption for 2012 acquired hotels also increased other departmental and support expenses by an incremental 24 million 53  management fees management fees which generally are calculated as a percentage of revenues and operating profit increased 116 to 222 million for 2013 base management fees which are calculated as a percentage of total revenues increased 11 million in 2013 incentive management fees which are calculated based on operating profit after our preferred return increased 18 million for the year management fees increased 5 million for 2013 due to incremental expenses from our recent acquisitions for 2012 base management fees increased 67 to 158 million and incentive management fees increased 296 to 48 million our management fees increased an incremental 4 million in 2012 as a result of acquired hotels other propertylevel expenses these expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance other propertylevel expenses decreased 200 million or 347 due to the expiration of the hpt leases on december 31 2012 excluding the effects of the hpt leases other propertylevel expenses increased 34 million or 10 in 2013 due to an increase in real estate taxes as well as 5 million due to incremental expenses from our recent acquisitions for 2012 expenses increased 22 million or 40 due mainly to increases in property taxes and expenses related to hotels leased from hpt as well as the inclusion of expenses from recently acquired hotels depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased 25 million or 35 to 697 million in 2013 the decrease is due to a decline in noncash impairment expenses of 59 million partially offset by an increase due to recent acquisitions and capital expenditures for 2012 depreciation and amortization expense increased 113 million or 186 to 722 million which includes a 60 million noncash impairment charge related to the westin mission hills resort amp spa the increase in 2012 also reflects the inclusion of depreciation expense for newly acquired properties and recent capital expenditures other income and expense corporate and other expenses corporate and other expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits employee stockbased compensation expense travel corporate insurance legal fees acquisitionrelated costs audit fees building rent and systems costs corporate expenses increased approximately 14 million or 131 in 2013 due to higher compensation expenses and legal costs including litigation accruals of 13 million which partially were offset by lower acquisition costs corporate expenses decreased approximately 4 million or 36 in 2012 corporate expenses in 2011 include a charge of 15 million related to a forfeited acquisition deposit during 2012 nonrecurrence of this expense was partially offset by increases in acquisition and compensation expenses gain on insurance settlements we recorded gains of 9 million and 2 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively related to the receipt of business interruption insurance proceeds for two properties in christchurch new zealand both of which were affected by an earthquake in february 2011 in 2012 we also recorded a gain of 2 million related to property insurance for two hotels in chile both of which were affected by an earthquake in february 2010 for further information on our insurance settlements see note 13 to our consolidated financial settlements  gain on insurance settlements interest income interest income in 2013 decreased approximately 19 million due to the 2012 maturity of the mortgage loan investment associated with the portfolio of five hotels acquired by the euro jv in november 2012 for 2012 and 2011 interest income primarily was attributable to amounts earned on this mortgage of 20 million and 17 million respectively interest expense interest expense decreased 69 million or 185 in 2013 due to the repayment or refinancing of debt that resulted in a decrease in our weighted average interest rates and overall debt balance total debt extinguishment costs increased 6 million in 2013 interest expense increased 2 million or 05 in 2012 the increase is due primarily to a 21 million increase in debt extinguishment costs which was partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate and overall debt balances in addition savings from our fixedtofloating interest rate swap reduced interest expense by 7 million in 2013 and 6 million for each of 2012 and 2011 the following table presents

reflects the cash interest expense for refinanced debt subsequent to the issuance of the new financing and prior to the repayment of the refinanced debt net gains on property transactions and other net gains on property transactions increased 20 million in 2013 due to the 21 million gain on the sale of land adjacent to our newport beach marriott hotel amp spa and a deferred 11 million gain related to an eminent domain claim by the state of georgia of 29 acres of land for the highway expansion at the atlanta marriott perimeter center the increase in 2012 was due to the 8 million gain related to the sale of land to the maui jv compared to a 2 million gain recorded in 2011 for the transfer of the le méridien piccadilly to the euro jv benefit provision for income taxes we lease substantially all of our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as trs for federal income tax purposes the difference between hotellevel operating cash flow and the aggregate rent paid to host lp by the trs represents taxable income or loss on which we record an income tax provision or benefit the decrease in the tax provision in 2013 reflects a decrease in taxable income at the trs due to an increase in rent expense in excess of the increase in operating profit from the hotels and a reduction of certain foreign taxes while the increase in 2012 reflects yearoveryear improvements in property operations recognized by our trs as well as increases in certain foreign taxes income loss from discontinued operations discontinued operations consist of five hotels disposed of in 2013 three hotels disposed of in 2012 and one hotel disposed of in 2011 and represents the results of operations and the gains or losses on the disposition of these hotels during the indicated periods the

of host inc and host lp the liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp are derived primarily from the activities of host lp which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations the incurrence of debt and the issuance of op units host incs only significant asset is the ownership of partnership interests of host lp therefore its financing and investing activities are conducted through host lp except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock proceeds from stock issuances by host inc are contributed to host lp in exchange for op units additionally funds used by host inc to pay dividends or to repurchase stock are provided by host lp therefore while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between host inc and host lp we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion applies both to host inc and host lp overview we look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash debt and equity in order to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry as operations have improved we have maintained our focus on strategically decreasing our debttoequity ratio through i acquisitions and other investments the majority of which were completed with available cash and proceeds from equity issuances and ii the repayment and refinancing of senior notes and mortgage debt in order to extend maturity dates and lower interest rates we have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt we have access to multiple types of financing as approximately 83 of our debt consists of senior notes exchangeable debentures and borrowings under our credit facility none of which are collateralized by specific hotel properties during 2013 our senior notes were rated investment grade by both moodys and standard amp poors and we subsequently issued 400 million of senior notes at 3¾ in 2013 we repaid 800 million of senior notes and 277 million of mortgage debt and refinanced 150 million of mortgage debt additionally only 10 of our consolidated hotels which represented just 3 of our 2013 revenues will be encumbered by mortgage debt subsequent to the repayment of a mortgage loan on march 1 2014 55  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our portfolio withstand declines in operating cash flow pay nearterm debt maturities and fund our

basis funds used by host inc to make cash distributions are provided by host lp our primary sources of cash are cash from operations proceeds from the sale of assets borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances the following graph summarizes our aggregate debt maturities as of february 14 2014             1the debt maturing in 2015 assumes the exercise of a put option by the holders of our exchangeable senior debentures capital resources we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth including acquisitions as a result the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure our financial flexibility including our ability to incur debt make distributions and make investments is 56  contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of such indebtedness which include among other things the allowable amounts of leverage interest coverage and fixed charges during 2012 and 2013 we decreased our nearterm debt maturities expanded our borrowing capacity under our credit facility through a term loan and maintained compliance with our senior note and credit facility covenants if at any time we determine that market conditions are favorable after taking into account our liquidity requirements we may seek to issue and sell shares of host inc common stock in registered public offerings including through sales directly on the new york stock exchange under any future at the market offering program or to issue and sell shares of host inc preferred stock we also may seek to cause host lp to issue debentures exchangeable for shares of host inc common stock or senior notes given our total debt level and maturity schedule we will continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time taking advantage of favorable market conditions in october 2013 host incs board of directors authorized repurchases of up to 680 million of senior notes exchangeable debentures and mortgage debt other than in accordance with its terms of which 530 million remains available under this authority we may purchase senior notes and exchangeable debentures for cash through open market purchases privately negotiated transactions a tender offer or in some cases through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and ffo per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs accordingly in light of our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets we may at any time subject to applicable securities laws be considering or be in discussions with respect to the purchase or sale of common stock exchangeable debentures andor senior notes any such transactions may subject to applicable securities laws occur simultaneously we continue actively to explore potential acquisitions and anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from sales of properties but also potentially from equity offerings of host inc or by issuances of op units by host lp the incurrence of debt available cash or advances under our credit facility given the nature of these transactions we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review bid on or negotiate to purchase we may acquire additional properties through various structures including transactions involving single assets portfolios joint ventures and acquisitions of the securities or assets of other reits counterparty credit risk we are subject to counterparty credit risk which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential nonperformance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price we assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligation to determine the impact if any of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition we are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions access to our credit facility and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited our exposure with regard to our cash and the 779 million available under our credit facility is mitigated as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions at december 31 2013 the exposure risk related to our derivative contracts totaled 4 million and the counterparties were investment grade financial institutions sources and uses of cash our sources of cash include cash from operations proceeds from debt and equity issuances and proceeds from asset sales uses of cash during the year consisted of acquisitions investments in our joint ventures capital expenditures operating costs debt repayments and repurchases and distributions to equity holders we anticipate that our sources and uses of cash will be similar during 2014 cash provided by operations our cash provided by operations for 2013 increased 238 million to 1019 million compared to 2012 primarily due to improved operations at our hotels and a decrease in cash interest payments cash used in investing activities approximately 75 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2013 compared to 886 million in 2012 in addition to the acquisition investment and disposition activity detailed in the charts below we spent approximately 436 million on capital expenditures a decrease of 202 million from 2012 our renewal and replacement capital expenditures for 2013 were approximately 303 million which reflects a decrease of approximately 17 from 2012 levels our renewal and replacement capital expenditures generally are funded by the furniture fixture and equipment funds established at certain of our hotels typically 5 of property revenues and by our available cash we also spent approximately 133 million in 2013 on roiredevelopment projects and acquisition capital expenditures which reflects a decrease of approximately 51 compared to 2012 levels additionally we have capitalized certain internal costs and interest expense associated with our capital expenditure projects in accordance with gaap these capitalized costs were 11 million 11 million and 9 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively capital expenditures have totaled approximately 23 billion over the past five years and as a result we believe that our properties are in a strong competitive position relative to their market competitors 57  the following tables summarize significant investment activities and dispositions that have been completed as of february 14 2014 in millions

that were repaid in february 2014  senior notes the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issued by host lp to which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semiannually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above under the terms of our senior notes indenture our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of host lps unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host lp pledges and guarantees under the senior notes indenture all host lp subsidiaries which guarantee host lp debt are required to similarly guarantee debt issuances under the indenture also to the extent the equity of any subsidiaries of host lp are pledged to secure borrowings under the credit facility such collateral likewise is required to secure senior note issuances under the 61  senior notes indenture while the credit facility currently does not include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests such guarantees or pledges will be subsequently required in the event that host lps leverage ratio exceeds 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility as well as the senior notes issued under the senior notes indenture and certain hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility if triggered the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain us and canadian subsidiaries of host lp and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would not provide guarantees or pledges of equity interests further if at any time our leverage ratio falls below 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters or host lp has an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating such guarantees and pledges may be released series d senior notes restrictive covenants on march 28 2013 we completed an underwritten public offering of 400 million aggregate principal amount of series d senior notes bearing interest at a rate of 375 per year due in 2023 the series d senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the october 15 2023 maturity date except at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium as set forth in the senior notes indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date the notes were issued under our existing senior notes indenture and have covenants customary for investment grade debt primarily limitations on our ability to incur debt there are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends because these senior notes were issued after we attained an investment grade rating while all other series of our senior notes were issued before we had attained an investment grade rating the covenants are different than the covenants applicable to our other senior notes under the terms of the series d senior notes host lps ability to incur indebtedness is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions including the achievement of an ebitdatointerest coverage ratio of at least 15x by host lp as calculated this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on host lps consolidated statement of operations in addition the calculation is based on host lps pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to certain transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period other covenants limiting host lps ability to incur indebtedness include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65 of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values maintaining secured indebtedness of less than 40 of adjusted total assets and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150 of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured indebtedness of host lp and its subsidiaries so long as host lp maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture it may incur additional debt we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants applicable to our series d senior notes the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture for our series d senior notes and our actual credit ratios as of december 31 2013                actual ratio     covenant requirement     unencumbered assets tests   426     minimum

minimum ratio of 15x    prior series of senior notes restrictive covenantscurrently our senior notes have an investment grade rating from both moodys and standard amp poors as a result many of the restrictive covenants contained in the senior notes indenture and the supplemental indentures for our prior series of senior notes are not applicable as they do not apply for so long as such series of notes maintain an investment grade rating from both moodys and standard amp poors the following primary covenants continue to apply to our existing senior notes other than our series d senior notesrestrict our ability to sell all or substantially all assets or merge with or into other companies andrequire us to make an offer to repurchase the existing senior notes then currently outstanding upon the occurrence of a change of control62  if our senior notes no longer are rated investment grade by either or both of moodys and standard amp poors then the following covenants and other restrictions will be reinstated for our existing senior notes but will not apply to the series d senior notes which have different covenants our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions will be subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions including the achievement of an ebitdatointerest coverage ratio of at least 20x we will be able to make distributions to enable host inc to pay dividends on its preferred stock if any under the senior notes indenture when our ebitdatointerest coverage ratio is above 17 to 10 this ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture applicable to our existing senior notes based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value and during the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 15 million of noncash interest which represents expense recorded as a result of the implementation in 2009 of an accounting requirement relating to our outstanding exchangeable senior debentures these amounts are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operationsother covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions would include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65 of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values excluding intangible assets and maintaining secured indebtedness and subsidiary indebtedness of less than 45 of adjusted total assets so long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture applicable to our existing senior notes we may make preferred or common op unit distributions and incur additional debt including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and make distributions when our senior notes no longer are rated investment grade we still will be permitted to incur certain types of debt including i credit facility debt ii refinancing debt iii up to 400 million of mortgage debt which proceeds would be used to repay debt under the credit facility and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount and iv up to 150 million of other debt we also will be permitted to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain host incs reit statusa requirement to maintain unencumbered assets based on undepreciated book values of not less than 125 of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other debt not secured by mortgages this coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or make distributions discussed above which consequences where we fall below the coverage level are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or make distributions but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture andour ability to make distributions on redeem or repurchase our op units permit payment or distribution restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries sell assets enter into transactions with affiliates and create certain liens will be restrictedthe following summarizes the actual credit ratios for our existing senior notes other than the series d senior notes as of december 31 2013 and the covenant requirements contained in the senior notes indenture that would be applicable at such times as our existing senior notes no longer are rated investment grade by either of moodys or standard amp poors even if we were to lose the investment grade rating we would be in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the senior notes indenture                actual ratio

notes and our other senior notes our actual ratios as reported can be slightly different exchangeable debentures as of december 31 2013 we have 400 million of 2½ exchangeable senior debentures outstanding that were issued on december 22 2009 the 2009 debentures on march 28 2013 we converted 174 million of 3¼ debentures that were issued on march 16 2004 into 117 million shares of host inc common stock and redeemed the remaining 1 million for cash the 2009 debentures are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes holders have the right to require us to purchase the 2009 debentures at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest the put option on october 15 2015 and on certain other subsequent dates holders of the 2009 debentures also have the right to exchange the 2009 debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions including at any time at which the closing price of host incs common stock is more than 130 of the exchange price per share for at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the 63  calendar quarter or at any time up to two days prior to the date on which the 2009 debentures have been called for redemption we can redeem for cash all or part of the 2009 debentures at any time subsequent to october 20 2015 at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus accrued interest if at any time we elect to redeem the 2009 debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price we would expect the holders to elect to exchange the 2009 debentures at the respective exchange value rather than receive the cash redemption price the exchange value is equal to the applicable exchange rate multiplied by the price of host incs common stock upon exchange the 2009 debentures would be exchanged for host incs common stock cash or a combination thereof at our option as of december 31 2013 the closing price of host incs common stock exceeded 130 of the exchange price for more than 20 of 30 consecutive prior trading days therefore the 2009 debentures are exchangeable by holders through march 31 2014 whether the 2009 debentures continue to be exchangeable after march 31 2014 will depend on future trading prices of host incs common stock currently each 1000 debenture would be exchanged for 747034 host inc common shares for an equivalent per share price of 1339 for a total of 299 million shares we separately account for the liability and equity components of our 2009 debentures in order to reflect the fair value of the liability component based on our nonconvertible borrowing cost at the issuance date accordingly we record the liability components of the debentures at fair value as of the date of issuance and amortize the resulting discount as an increase to interest expense through the initial put option date of the 2009 debentures which is the expected life of the debt however there is no impact of this accounting treatment on our cash interest payments we measured the fair value of the debt components of the 2009 debentures at issuance based on an effective interest rate of 69 as a result we attributed 82 million of the proceeds received to the conversion feature of the 2009 debentures this amount represents the excess proceeds received over the fair value of the debt at the date of issuance and is included in host incs additional paidin capital and host lps partners capital on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2013 the debt carrying value and unamortized discount were 371 million and 29 million respectivelyinterest expense recorded for the 2009 debentures and our prior series of exchangeable debentures for the periods presented consists of the following in millions         year ended

administrative agent jpmorgan chase bank na as syndication agent wells fargo bank na deutsche bank ag new york branch and the bank of nova scotia as codocumentation agents and certain other agents and lenders the credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to 1 billion including a foreign currency subfacility for canadian dollars australian dollars new zealand dollars japanese yen euros and british pound sterling of up to the foreign currency equivalent of 500 million subject to a lower amount in the case of new zealand dollar borrowings the credit facility also provides a subfacility of up to 100 million for swingline borrowings and a subfacility of up to 100 million for issuances of letters of credit host lp also has the option to increase the aggregate principal amount of the credit facility by up to 500 million subject to obtaining additional loan commitments and satisfaction of certain conditions the credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of november 2015 with an option for host lp to extend the term for one additional year subject to certain conditions including the payment of an extension fee credit facility term loan on july 25 2012 we expanded the credit facility to add a new term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 500 million the term loan was established through an exercise of the option under the credit facility to increase the amount of the facility by up to 500 million we also amended the credit facility to allow us to retain the ability to exercise this option in the future for up to an additional 500 million of commitments subject to obtaining additional loan commitments and the satisfaction of the other conditions specified in the credit facility the term loan will mature in july 2017 the maturity date of the revolving loan commitments under the credit facility remains unchanged the term loan does not require any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity in 2013 and prior years we paid interest on the term loan at floating interest rates plus a margin ranging from 165 to 265 basis points depending on host lps consolidated leverage ratio on and after january 24 2014 the date on which host lp elected ratingsbased pricing we will pay interest on the term loan at floating rates plus a margin ranging from 115 to 200 basis points depending on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating based on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating at january 24 2014 the margin would be 145 basis points the term loan otherwise is subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees and pledges of security interests in subsidiaries operational covenants financial covenants and events of default as discussed below 64  collateral and guarantees the credit facility does not currently include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests in our subsidiaries or any other security and the guarantees and pledges are required only in the event that host lps leverage ratio exceeds 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility as well as the notes outstanding under host lps senior notes indenture interest rate and currency hedges and certain other hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility even when triggered the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain us and canadian subsidiaries of host lp and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would provide neither guarantees nor pledges of equity interests further if at any time our leverage ratio falls below 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters or host lp has an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating such guarantees and pledges may be released prepayments voluntary prepayments of the loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty the loans under the credit facility are required to be prepaid in the event that asset sales reduce adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values to below 10 billion if we do not reinvest the proceeds of those asset sales in new properties at december 31 2013 we have adjusted total assets as defined in our credit facility of 20 billion financial covenants  the credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 725x our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 175x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 125x the financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility hence so long as there are no amounts outstanding thereunder and the term loan is repaid we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the credit facility in the future if we were ever to regain compliance with the financial covenants these calculations are performed based on pro forma

inc common stock this adjustment was made to avoid any unintended dilution to the op unitholders as a result of the portion of host incs 2009 special dividend paid in common stock to its stockholders investors should take into account the 13 noncontrolling position of host lp op units when analyzing dividend payments by host inc to its stockholders as these holders of op units share on a pro rata basis in amounts being distributed by host lp to holders of its corresponding op units for example if host inc paid a 1 per share dividend on its common stock it would be based on the payment of a 1021494 per common unit distribution by host lp to host inc as well as to the other common op unitholders during 2013 host incs board of directors declared dividends of 046 per share beginning in the first quarter at 010 per share and increasing by 001 per share each quarter thereafter on host incs common stock accordingly host lp made a distribution of 04698872 per unit on its common op units

corporation we are obligated to pay certain taxes federal state local and foreign including any related interest and penalties relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us for example a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us this adjustment could produce a tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement additionally under the partnership agreement between host inc and host lp host lp is obligated to pay certain taxes federal state local and foreign including any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc as well as any liabilities the irs may successfully assert against host inc we do not expect any amounts paid under these tax sharing

arrangements but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote the largest guarantees by dollar amount are listed below we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested nonlodging properties these primarily represent certain restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately 17 million as of december 31 2013 in 1997 we

are required to make any payments under the guarantee we have been indemnified by barceló crestline corporation who in turn is indemnified by the current owner of the facility in connection with the sale of two hotels in january 2005 we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases the future minimum lease payments are approximately 12 million through the full term of the leases including renewal options we believe that the likelihood of any liability arising related to these ground leases is remote and in each case we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel guarantees and environmental liabilities that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet includein connection with the sale of the atlanta marriott marquis in january 2013 we retained

amounts shown include amortization of principal debt maturities and estimated interest payments interest payments have been included in this category based on the weighted average interest rate 2our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels under our contracts we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years 3the amounts shown include deferred management fees and the estimated amount of tax expense under terms of our management agreements we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owners priority to us the timing of the payments if any is based on future operations the termination of the management agreement or the sale of the hotel and is therefore not determinable the estimated amount of tax expense relates to uncertain tax liabilities from prior years critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates we evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to the impairment of longlived assets on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates hotels acquired in a business combination we record our investments in hotel properties based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition date property and equipment are recorded at fair value and allocated to buildings improvements furniture fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties fair values are based on the exit price ie the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we evaluate several factors including market data for similar assets expected cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair value of our assets other items that we evaluate in a business combination include identifiable intangible assets capital lease assets and obligations and goodwill identifiable intangible assets typically are assumed contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements which are recorded at fair value abovemarket and belowmarket contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the contract intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the remaining noncancelable term of the related agreements capital lease obligations that are assumed as part of the acquisition of a leasehold interest are measured at fair value and included as debt on the accompanying balance sheet and we record the corresponding righttouse assets classification of a lease does not change if it is part of a business combination in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data including thirdparty appraisals and valuations in certain situations a deferred tax liability may be created due to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the asset at the acquisition date any consideration paid in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired would be recorded to goodwill in very limited circumstances we may record a bargain purchase gain if the consideration paid is less than the net fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired furthermore acquisitionrelated costs such as due diligence legal and accounting fees are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets 71  impairment testing we analyze our assets for impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying values thereof may not be recoverable we consider a property to be impaired when the sum of future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset for impaired assets we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the propertys carrying value over its fair value to the extent that a property has a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that it is more likely than not the property will be disposed of prior to the end of its useful life it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the propertys carrying value in the absence of other factors we assume that the estimated life is equal to the gaap depreciable life because of the continuous property maintenance and improvement capital expenditures required under our management agreements we adjust our assumptions with respect to the remaining useful life of the property if situations dictate otherwise such as an expiring ground lease or that it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold prior to its previously expected useful life we also consider the effect of regular renewal and replacement capital expenditures on the estimated life of our properties including critical infrastructure which regularly is maintained and then replaced at the end of its useful life we test for impairment in several situations including when a property has a current or projected loss from operations when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when other events trends contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in the evaluation of the impairment of our assets we make many assumptions and estimates including projected cash flows both from operations and the eventual disposition expected useful life and holding period future required capital expenditures and fair values including consideration of capitalization rates discount rates and comparable selling prices while we consider all of the above indicators as preliminary indicators to determine if the carrying value may not be recovered by undiscounted cash flows we reviewed the actual yeartodate and the projected cash flows from operations in order to identify properties with actual or projected annual operating losses or minimal operating profit as of december 31 2013 the projected cash flows consider items such as booking pace occupancy room rate and propertylevel operating costs as a result of our review we identified five properties that required further consideration of property and market specific conditions or factors to determine if the property was impaired using an undiscounted cash flow analysis management considered a range of revpar and operating margins compared to prior years operating results in evaluating the probabilityweighted projected cash flows from operations to appropriately evaluate if the carrying value of the assets was recoverable we projected cash flows such that the individual properties would return to normalized levels of operations generally within five years and thereafter grow at a stabilized rate of approximately 3 over the remaining estimated lives of the properties this stabilized growth rate is lower than the projected growth rate for the urban upper upscale properties which we believe is most representative of our portfolio over the period from 2013 through 2023 based on this testing four of the properties identified did not require further analysis based on additional testing one property exhibited an impaired value at december 31 2013 management believes its assumptions and estimates reflect current market conditions we recognized impairment expense in the aggregate amount of 1 million and 60 million for 2013 and 2012 respectively based on a change in their estimated hold periods otherthantemporary impairment of an investment we review our equity method investments for otherthantemporary impairment based on the occurrence of any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an otherthantemporary basis triggering events can include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment a change in the expected hold period or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel properties therefore we generally will have few observable inputs and will determine the fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment as well as considering the impact of other elements ie control premiums etc we use certain inputs such as available thirdparty appraisals and forecast net operating income for the hotel properties to estimate the expected cash flows if an equity method investment is impaired a loss is recorded for the difference between its fair value and its carrying value based on this test no otherthantemporary impairment was recorded in 2013 classification of assets as held for sale our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale of the asset is probable prior to classifying it as such will be completed within one year and that actions required to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that it is unlikely the planned sale will not occur this policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner specifically we typically will classify properties that we actively are marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met host incs board of directors has approved the sale to the extent that the dollar amount of the sale requires board approval 72  a binding agreement to sell the property has been signed the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and no significant contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner to the extent that a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property we will record an impairment expense depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets as well as specific market and economic conditions while management believes its estimates are reasonable a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels valuation of deferred tax assets we have approximately 113 million net of a valuation allowance of 61 million of net deferred tax assets as of december 31 2013 the objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a companys financial statements or tax returns we have considered various factors including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the 113 million of net deferred tax assets in the future when a determination is made that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized an increase in income tax expense will be recorded in that period valuation of derivative contracts we occasionally will enter into derivative products including interest rate and foreign currency swaps caps and collars derivative instruments are subject to fair value reporting at each reporting date and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income loss or other comprehensive income loss based on the applicable hedge accounting guidance we estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use of third party valuations which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted future expected cash payments we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings thresholds mutual puts and guarantees the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves the values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations the fair value of our derivatives likely will fluctuate from yeartoyear based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity stock compensation we recognize costs resulting from host incs sharebased payment transactions over their vesting periods we classify sharebased payment awards granted in exchange for employee services either as equity awards or liability awards the classification of host incs restricted stock awards either as an equity award or a liability award is based upon cash settlement options equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period awards are classified as liability awards to the extent that settlement features allow the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax withholding requirements the value of these restricted stock awards less estimated forfeitures is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  the requisite service period usually the vesting period no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite services on january 20 2012 the compensation policy committee of the board of directors adopted a new annual compensation plan for senior management the annual plan that replaces the expired threeyear plan 20092011 2009 compensation program the key components of the annual plan include the following awards restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions these awards vest based on the total shareholder return tsr relative to i the nareit index ii the sampp index and iii a selected lodging company index that serves as a relevant industryasset specific measurement to our competitors us based senior management may elect to have amounts withheld for taxes in excess of minimum statutory tax requirements and as result tsr awards granted to these employees are classified as liability awards and are remeasured to fair value each reporting period in contrast senior management located outside of the us are limited as to the amount of shares they may use for statutory tax requirements and as result tsr awards granted to these employees are classified as equity awards and are recorded at fair value as of the grant date the valuation of these awards is a custom calculation that is based on common valuation techniques such as the lattice 73  binomial and blackscholes valuation methodologies the utilization of this model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of host incs common stock riskfree interest rates actual tsr from the beginning of the performance period through the measurement date and host incs stock beta as compared to the average risk of the peer groups restricted stock awards with vesting based on performance conditions these awards are earned based on achieving a specified performance target which will be based on the employees and the companys specific management business objectives for the performance year compensation cost will be recognized when the achievement of the performance condition is considered probable if a performance condition has more than one outcome that is probable recognition of compensation cost will be based on the condition that is the most likely outcome for us based senior management these awards are classified as liability awards due to their cash settlement provisions therefore the value of the shares to be issued by host inc will be based on host incs share price on the reporting date stock option awards the stock option awards are equity classified awards as they do not include cash settlement features therefore the value of the award is determined on the grant date using a binomial pricing model and is not adjusted for future changes in fair value vesting for these awards is based on service conditions the utilization of the binomial model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock riskfree interest rates and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited and our expected dividend yield on february 6 2013 host inc granted senior management 17 million restricted shares for performance year 2013 which amount represents the maximum number of shares that can be earned during the year if performance is at the high level of achievement vesting of these shares is subject to meeting the performance measures outlined above approximately 50 of the restricted shares granted are marketbased with the remaining performancebased in addition host inc awarded approximately 04 million stock options with an exercise price of 1655 per share for performance year 2013 during 2013 we recorded approximately 18 million of stock compensation expense associated with the 2013 grant consolidation policies judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in terms of the evaluation of control including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests we consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the subsidiary for the majority of our hotel and real estate investments we consider those rights to be i approval or amendment of developments plans ii financing decisions iii approval or amendments of operating budgets and iv investment strategy decisions for those partnerships and joint ventures of which we are the general partner we review the rights of the limited partners to determine if those rights would preclude the presumption of control as the general partner limited partner rights which would preclude presumption of control by the general partner include the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the limited partnership or otherwise remove us as the general partner without cause and substantive participating rights primarily through voting rights we also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they should be considered variable interest entities vies if a subsidiary is a vie it is subject to the consolidation framework specifically for vies we consider an entity a vie if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support we review our subsidiaries and affiliates annually to determine if i they should be considered vies and ii whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in their characteristics foreign currency translation the operations of international subsidiaries are maintained in their functional currency which generally is the local currency and are translated to us dollars using the average exchange rates for the period the assets and liabilities are translated to us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments are reflected in other comprehensive income loss foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency of each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at period end exchange rates the resulting exchange differences are recorded in gain loss on foreign currency transactions and derivatives except when recorded in other

ie revpar average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues expenses adjusted operating profit and associated margins for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis because these statistics and operating results relate only to our hotel properties they exclude results for our nonhotel properties and other real estate investments we define our comparable hotels as properties ithat are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and iithat have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone largescale capital projects as further defined below during the reporting periods being compared the hotel business is capitalintensive and renovations are a regular part of the business generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels a large scale capital project that would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set is an extensive renovation of several core aspects of the hotel such as rooms meeting space lobby bars restaurants and other public spaces both quantitative and qualitative factors are taken into consideration in determining if the renovation would cause a hotel to be removed from the comparable hotel set including unusual or exceptional circumstances such as a reduction or increase in room count rebranding a significant alteration of the business operations or the closing of the hotel during the renovation we do not include an acquired hotel in our comparable hotel set until the operating results for that hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year for example we acquired the grand hyatt washington in july 2012 the hotel was not included in our comparable hotels until january 1 2014 hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption or commence a largescale capital project in each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after completion of the repair of the property damage or cessation of the business interruption or the completion of largescale capital projects as applicable of the 115 hotels we owned on december 31 2013 105 have been classified as comparable hotels the operating results of the following hotels that we owned or leased as of december 31 2013 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods the ritzcarlton naples removed in the third quarter of 2013 business interruption due to the closure of the hotel during extensive renovations which included renovations of 450 rooms including 35 suites restaurant façade and windowshyatt place waikiki beach acquired in may 2013grand hyatt washington acquired in july 2012 the westin new york grand central business interruption due to rebranding of the hotel and extensive renovations that were substantially completed by december 2012 including the renovation of 774 guest rooms lobby public and meeting spaces fitness center restaurant and bar

august 2013 and september 2012orlando world center marriott removed in the third quarter of 2012 business interruption due to extensive renovations which included façade restoration the shutdown of the main pool and a complete restoration and enhancement of the hotel including new water slides and activity areas new pool dining facilities and the renovation of one tower of guestrooms meeting space and restaurants atlanta marriott perimeter center removed in the third quarter of 2011 business interruption due to extensive renovations that were completed in april 2012 including renovation

2011 business interruption due to extensive renovations that were completed in january 2013 including the conversion of one tower of the hotel into apartments reducing the room count and the renovation of the remaining guest rooms lobby bar and meeting space the operating results of eight hotels disposed of in 2013 and 2012 are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods

denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period for comparative purposes we also present the revpar results for 2012 assuming the results of our foreign operations were translated using the same exchange rates that were effective for the comparable periods in 2013 thereby eliminating the effect of currency fluctuation for the yearoveryear comparisons we believe this presentation is useful to investors as it provides clarity with respect to the growth in revpar in the local currency of the hotel consistent with how we would evaluate our domestic portfolio however the effect of changes in foreign currency has been reflected in the actual results of net income ebitda earnings per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share nominal us results include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentationwe also present revpar results for our joint venture in europe in constant euros using the same methodology as used for the constant us presentation nongaap financial measures we use certain nongaap financial measures which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap within the meaning of applicable sec rules these measures are as follows i ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp ii funds from operations ffo and ffo per diluted share both nareit and adjusted as a measure of performance for host inc and iii comparable hotel operating results as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the nareit definition of ffo or do not calculate ffo per 76  diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance in addition although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to nonreits we also calculate adjusted ffo per diluted share which measure is not in accordance with nareit guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other reits ebitda and adjusted ebitda as presented also may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with gaap cash expenditures for various longterm assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures interest expense for ebitda and adjusted ebitda purposes only and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the ebitda adjusted ebitda nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share presentations management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our nongaap financial measures additionally nareit ffo per diluted share adjusted ffo per diluted share ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions in addition nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as a measure of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders benefit the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries management believes ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization management also believes the use of ebitda facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits hotel owners who are not reits and other capitalintensive companies management uses ebitda to evaluate propertylevel results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs adjusted ebitda historically management has adjusted ebitda when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of adjusted ebitda when combined with the primary gaap presentation of net income is beneficial to an investors complete understanding of our operating performance adjusted ebitda also is a relevant measure in calculating certain credit ratios we adjust ebitda for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as adjusted ebitda real estate transactions  we exclude the effect of gains and losses including the amortization of deferred gains recorded on the disposition or acquisition of depreciable assets and property insurance gains in our consolidated statement of operations because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets in addition material gains or losses from the depreciated book value of the disposed assets could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value often does not reflect its market value as noted below for ffo equity investment adjustments  we exclude the equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated investments in partnerships and joint ventures as presented in our consolidated statement of operations because it includes our pro rata portion of depreciation amortization and interest expense which are excluded from ebitda we include our pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our equity investments as we believe this more accurately reflects the performance of our investments the pro rata adjusted ebitda of equity investments is defined as the ebitda of our equity investments adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by our percentage ownership in the partnership or joint venture consolidated partnership adjustments  we deduct the noncontrolling partners pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our consolidated partnerships as this reflects the noncontrolling owners interest in the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships the pro rata adjusted ebitda of noncontrolling partners is defined as the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by the noncontrolling partners positions in the partnership or joint venture cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  infrequently the financial accounting standards board fasb promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a 77  change in accounting principle we exclude these onetime adjustments because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period impairment losses  we exclude the effect of impairment expense recorded because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets in addition we believe that impairment expense which is based on historical cost book values is similar to gains losses on dispositions and depreciation expense both of which also are excluded from ebitda acquisition costs  under gaap costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company litigation gains and losses  effective april 1 2013 we have excluded the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business which is consistent with the definition of adjusted ffo that we adopted effective january 1 2011 we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performancein unusual circumstances we also may adjust ebitda for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance for example in the first quarter of 2013 management excluded the 11 million gain from the eminent domain claim for land adjacent to the atlanta marriott perimeter center for which we received the cash proceeds in 2007 but pending the resolution of certain contingencies was not recognized until 2013 typically gains from the disposition of nondepreciable property are included in the determination of adjusted ebitdathe following table provides a

                         1during the first quarter of 2013 we recognized a previously deferred gain of approximately 11 million related to the eminent domain claim by the state of georgia for 29 acres of land at the atlanta marriott perimeter center for highway expansion for which we received cash proceeds in 2007 we have included the gain in nareit ffo per diluted share which is consistent with the treatment of gains recognized on the disposition of undepreciated assets however due to the significant passage of time since we received the proceeds we have excluded the gain from adjusted ffo per diluted share and adjusted ebitda for the year 2reflects the interest expense depreciation and amortization and income taxes included in discontinued operations 3ebitda and adjusted ebitda include a gain on sale of undepreciated property of 21 million for the year ended december 31 2013 for the sale of excess land adjacent to our newport beach marriott hotel amp spa as a gain on sale of undepreciated property 4reflects the gain recorded on the sale of five hotels in 2013 and three hotels in 20125effective april 1 2013 we modified the definition of adjusted ebitda to exclude gains or losses associated with litigation outside the ordinary course of business which is consistent with the definition of adjusted ffo that we adopted effective january 1 2011 on december 13 2013 the texas supreme court 78  granted our petition for review on litigation related to the sale of land under the san antonio marriott rivercenter in 2005 we have accrued 68 million related to this litigation which we believe reflects substantially all of our obligation assuming we lose the appeal we have 25 million in restricted cash that will be utilized to pay a portion of any judgment assuming we lose the appeal 6includes an adjustment of 15 million for our portion of the noncash impairment charges related to one of the hotels in our joint venture in europe the impairment charge has no effect on adjusted ebitda nareit ffo or adjusted ffonareit ffo nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share we present nareit ffo and nareit ffo per diluted share as nongaap measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share as our nareit ffo defined as set forth below for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with nareit guidelines nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains losses from sales of real estate the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles real estaterelated depreciation amortization and impairments and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the ffo of those entities on the same basis we believe that nareit ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of nareit ffo per diluted share when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairments and gains and losses from sales of real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other reits even though nareit ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as noted by nareit in its april 2002 white paper on funds from operations since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves for these reasons nareit adopted the ffo metric in order to promote an industrywide measure of reit operating performance we also present adjusted ffo per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs we believe that the presentation of adjusted ffo per diluted share when combined with both the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share and ffo per diluted share as defined by nareit provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investors complete understanding of our operating performance we adjust nareit ffo per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as adjusted ffo per diluted share gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired we also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock we believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs acquisition costs under gaap costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company litigation gains and losses  we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance in unusual circumstances we also may adjust nareit ffo for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance for example in the first quarter of 2013 management excluded the 11 million gain from the eminent domain claim for land adjacent to the atlanta marriott perimeter center for which we received the cash proceeds in 2007 but pending the resolution of certain contingencies was not recognized until 2013 typically gains from the

operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin on a comparable hotel or same store basis as supplemental information for investors our comparable hotel results present operating results for hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions significant property damage or large scale capital improvements during these periods we present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporatelevel costs including expenses related to our capital structure as well as depreciation and amortization we eliminate corporatelevel costs and expenses to arrive at property level results because we believe propertylevel results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels we eliminate depreciation and amortization because even though depreciation and amortization are propertylevel expenses these noncash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves as a result of the elimination of corporatelevel costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the periodtoperiod performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners in particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues andor expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of these hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results for these reasons we believe that comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management 81  the following table presents

seven properties in new zealand interest rate swap derivatives designated as fair value hedges we have designated our fixedtofloating interest rate swap derivatives as fair value hedges we enter into these derivative instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt that occur as a result of changes in market interest rates the derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement we also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps the change in the fair value of the derivative is offset largely by the corresponding change in the fair value of the underlying debt due to change in the 3month libor rate which is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt any difference between the change in the fair value of the swap and the change in the fair value in the underlying debt which was not significant for the periods presented is considered the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship and is recorded in net income loss we have three fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount of 300 million during 2013 and 2012 the fair value of the swaps decreased 6 million and 4 million respectively as a result we will pay a floating interest rate equal to the 3month libor plus a spread which ranges from 27 to 32 as opposed to the fixed rate of 5531 on the notional amount of 300 million through march 1 2014 during 2013 and 2012 the cash settlement received under the swap agreement decreased interest expense by 7 million and 6 million respectively 85  exchange rate sensitivity we have currency exchange risk as a result of our hotel ownership in australia canada chile mexico brazil and new zealand and our investment in the european

consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of host inc host lp and their subsidiaries and controlled affiliates including joint ventures and partnerships we consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability 104 host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity for those partnerships and joint ventures where we are the general partner we review the rights of the limited partners to determine if those rights would overcome the presumption of control as the general partner limited partner rights which would overcome presumption of control by the general partner include the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause and substantive participating rights over activities considered most significant to the business of the partnership or joint venture primarily voting rights we also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they are variable interest entities vies typically the entity that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance would consolidate the vie we consider an entity a vie if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support we review our subsidiaries at least annually to determine if i they should be considered vies and ii whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in the characteristics of these entities use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents restricted cash restricted cash includes reserves for debt service real estate taxes insurance furniture fixtures and equipment replacement as well as cash collateral and excess cash flow deposits due to mortgage debt agreement restrictions and provisions and a reserve required for potential legal damages for purposes of the statements of cash flows changes in restricted cash caused by changes in required legal reserves are shown as operating activities changes in restricted cash caused by using such funds for furniture fixtures and equipment replacement are shown as investing activities the remaining changes in restricted cash are the direct result of restrictions under our loan agreements and are reflected in cash flows from financing activities property and equipment generally property and equipment is recorded at cost for properties we develop cost includes interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction for property and equipment acquired in a business combination we record the assets based on their fair value as of the acquisition date replacements and improvements and capital leases are capitalized while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred we depreciate our property and equipment using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets we capitalize certain inventory such as china glass silver linen at the time of a hotel opening or acquisition or when significant inventory is purchased in conjunction with a major rooms renovation or when the number of rooms or meeting space at a hotel is expanded these amounts are then amortized over the estimated useful life of three years subsequent replacement purchases are expensed when placed in service we maintain a furniture fixtures and equipment replacement fund for renewal and replacement capital expenditures at certain hotels which generally is funded with 5 of property revenues we analyze our consolidated properties for impairment when events or circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we consider a property to be impaired when the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset we test for impairment in several situations including when a property has a current or projected loss from operations when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when other events trends contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable for impaired assets we record an impairment expense equal to the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value in the evaluation of the impairment of our assets we make 105 host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements many assumptions and estimates including assumptions of the projected cash flows both from operations and the eventual disposition the expected useful life and holding period of the asset the future required capital expenditures and fair values including consideration of capitalization rates discount rates and comparable selling prices as well as available thirdparty appraisals during 2013 and 2012 we recognized impairment expenses of 1 million and 60 million respectively each on one property which impairment expenses are included in depreciation and amortization based on changes in estimated holding periods we perform a similar analysis for our equity method investments for impairment based on the occurrence of triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an otherthantemporary basis triggering events can include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment a change in the expected useful life or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel properties therefore we generally will have few observable inputs and will determine fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment as well as consideration of the impact of other elements ie control premiums etc if an equity method investment is impaired and that impairment is determined to be other than temporary an expense is recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment we will classify a hotel as held for sale when the sale thereof is probable will be completed within one year and actions to complete the sale unlikely are to change or that the sale will not occur we typically classify assets as held for sale when host incs board of directors has approved the sale a binding agreement to sell the property has been signed under which the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and no significant financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner if these criteria are met we will cease recording depreciation and will record an impairment expense if the fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount of the hotel we will classify the impairment expense together with the related operating results including interest expense on debt assumed by the buyer or that is required to be repaid as a result of the sale as discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of operations and classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the balance sheet gains on sales of properties are recognized at the time of sale or deferred and recognized as income in subsequent periods as conditions requiring deferral are satisfied or expire without further cost to us we recognize the fair value of any liability for conditional asset retirement obligations including environmental remediation liabilities when incurred which generally is upon acquisition construction or development andor through the normal operation of the asset if sufficient information exists with which to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation intangible assets and liabilities in conjunction with our acquisitions we may identify intangible assets and liabilities identifiable intangible assets and liabilities typically include contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements which are recorded at fair value these contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the contract intangible assets and liabilities are amortized using the straightline method over the remaining noncancelable term of the related agreements noncontrolling interests other consolidated partnerships as of december 31 2013 we consolidate five majorityowned partnerships that have thirdparty noncontrolling ownership interests the thirdparty partnership interests are included in noncontrolling interestother consolidated partnerships on the consolidated balance sheets and totaled 34 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 two of the partnerships have finite lives that terminate between 2081 and 2095 and the associated noncontrolling interests are mandatorily redeemable at the end of but not prior to the finite life at december 31 2013 and 2012 the fair values of the noncontrolling interests in the partnerships with finite lives were approximately 68 million and 65 million respectively net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated partnerships is included in our determination of net income loss net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of third parties is 4 million 1 million and 1 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively host incs treatment of the noncontrolling interests of host lp host inc adjusts the noncontrolling interests of host lp each period so that the amount presented equals the greater of its carrying value based on its historical cost or its redemption value the historical cost is based on the proportional relationship between the historical cost of equity held by our common stockholders relative to that of the unitholders of host lp the redemption value is based on the amount of cash or host inc stock at our option that would be paid to the noncontrolling interests of host lp if it were terminated we have estimated that the redemption value is equivalent to the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the op units currently owned by unrelated third parties one op unit 106 host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements may be exchanged for 1021494 shares of host inc common stock valued at the market price of host inc common stock at the balance sheet date noncontrolling interests of host lp are classified in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet as they do not meet the requirements for equity classification because the redemption feature requires the delivery of registered shares the table below details the historical cost and redemption values for the noncontrolling interests         as of december 31         2013     2012     op units outstanding millions     95

income loss is allocated to the noncontrolling interests of host lp based on their weighted average ownership percentage during the period net income loss attributable to host inc has been reduced by the amount attributable to noncontrolling interests in host lp which totaled 4 million 1 million and 02 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively distributions from investments in affiliates we classify the distributions from our equity investments in the statements of cash flows based upon an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances of each distribution for example distributions from cash generated by property operations are classified as cash flows from operating activities however distributions received as a result of property sales are classified as cash flows from investing activities income taxes host inc has elected to be treated as a reit effective january 1 1999 pursuant to the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended in general a corporation that elects reit status and meets certain tax law requirements regarding the distribution of its taxable income to its stockholders as prescribed by applicable tax laws and complies with certain other requirements relating primarily to the composition of its assets and the sources of its revenues generally is not subject to federal and state income taxation on its operating income that is distributed to its stockholders as a partnership for federal income tax purposes host lp is not subject to federal income tax host lp is however subject to state local and foreign income and franchise tax in certain jurisdictions in addition to paying federal and state income tax on any retained income one of our subsidiary reits is subject to a tax on builtin gains on sales of certain assets additionally each of the host lp taxable reit subsidiaries is taxable as a regular c corporation subject to federal state and foreign income tax our consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes the income tax provision or benefit related to the operations of our taxable reit subsidiaries state local and foreign income and franchise taxes incurred by host lp under the partnership agreement host lp generally is required to reimburse host inc for any tax payments it is required to make accordingly the tax information included herein represents disclosures regarding host inc and its subsidiaries deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for net operating loss capital loss and tax credit carryovers deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which such amounts are expected to be realized or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted however deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies 107 host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements gaap prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return we must determine whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position once it is determined that a position meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold the position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement in order to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements this accounting standard applies to all tax positions related to income taxes we recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses deferred charges financing costs related to longterm debt are deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the debt using the effective interest method foreign currency translation as of december 31 2013 our international operations consist of hotels located in australia brazil canada chile mexico and new zealand as well as investments in the euro jv and the asiapacific jv the financial statements of these hotels and our investments therein are maintained in their functional currency and their operations are translated to us dollars using the average exchange rates for the period the assets and liabilities of the hotels and the investments therein are translated to us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments are reflected in other comprehensive income loss foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency for each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at period end exchange rates the resulting exchange differences are recorded in gain loss on foreign currency transactions and derivatives on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations except when recorded in other comprehensive income loss as qualifying net investment hedges derivative instruments we are subject to market exposures in several aspects of our business and may enter into derivative instruments in order to hedge the effect of these market exposures on our operations potential market exposures for which we may use derivative instruments to hedge include i changes in the fair value of our international investments due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates ii changes in the fair value of our fixedrate debt due to changes in the underlying interest rates and iii variability in interest payments due to changes in the underlying interest rate for our floatingrate debt prior to entering into the derivative instrument we evaluate whether the transaction will qualify for hedge accounting and continue to evaluate hedge effectiveness throughout the life of the instrument derivative instruments that meet the requirements for hedge accounting are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with offsetting changes recorded to net income loss or other comprehensive income loss based on the applicable hedge accounting guidance we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to reflect as applicable our own nonperformance risk or the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements in adjusting the fair value of our derivative instruments for the effect of nonperformance risk we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings thresholds mutual puts and

present on a net basis excluded from revenues on our statements of operations fair value measurementin evaluating the fair value of both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities gaap outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market assumptions based on market data observable inputs and a reporting entitys own assumptions about market data unobservable inputs fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date in an orderly transaction an exit price assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy the three levels are as follows level 1  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date an active market is defined as a market in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing on an ongoing basis level 2  inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active markets with few transactions inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability ie interest rates yield curves etc and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data correlation or other means level 3  unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the pricing of an asset or liability when observable inputs are not

of our 2009 debentures in order to reflect the fair value of the liability component based on our nonconvertible borrowing cost at the issuance date accordingly we record the liability components of the 2009 debentures at fair value as of the date of issuance and amortize the resulting discount as an increase to interest expense through the initial put option date of the 2009 debentures which is the expected life of the debt however there is no effect of this accounting treatment on our cash interest payments we measured the fair value of the debt components of the 2009 debentures at issuance

estimated undiscounted net cash flow we concluded that the carrying value of the hotel was not fully recoverable we estimated the fair value of the hotel using a discounted cash flow analysis with an estimated stabilized growth rate of 3 a discounted cash flow term of 10 years a capitalization rate of 11 and a discount rate of 12 the discount and capitalization rates used for the fair value of the

fair value hedges we have designated our fixedtofloating interest rate swap derivatives as fair value hedges we enter into these derivative instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt that occur as a result of changes in market interest rates the derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement we also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are largely offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the underlying debt due to changes in the 3month libor rate which change is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt any difference between the change in the fair value of the swap and the change in the fair value in the underlying debt which was not significant for the periods presented is considered the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship and is recognized in net income loss we have three

business interruption we recorded a loss of 3 million which represents the estimated deductible under our insurance policy in the second quarter of 2011 we estimated that we incurred approximately 33 million of property damage which amount represents the book value of the properties and equipment written off less any deductible and the related repairs and cleanup costs incurred any gains resulting from insurance proceeds are not recognized until all contingencies are resolved during 2012 and 2011 we recognized a gain of 9 million and 2 million respectively for the receipt of business interruption insurance proceeds as of december 31 2013 we have agreed upon settlement amounts with our primary insurer for all property and business interruption insurance except for real property damage to the warners building while the primary insurer has recognized its liability with regard to the warners building there is no agreed settlement amount for real property damage to the warners building as the ground lessor has filed suit to recover a portion of the insurance proceeds from the primary insurer for the hotel while we can provide no assurance as to the timing of when this dispute will be settled we believe that it is more likely than not that we will recover the full value of our insurance receivable in addition we have made a separate claim for reimbursement under our corporate policy though we have not recorded any additional amounts of insurance receivable with regard to this claim we have received 21 million of cash for property insurance and have an outstanding insurance receivable of 8 million which is included in other assets representing the remaining claims for property damage  131 host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and

operating agreements with some of our hotels also being subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operation under the designated brand the hotel brands of three of our managers marriott starwood and hyatt represent 58 24 and 12 of our total revenues respectively under these agreements the managers generally have sole responsibility for all activities necessary for the daytoday operation of the hotels including establishing room rates processing reservations and promoting and publicizing the hotels the managers also provide all employees for the hotels prepare reports budgets and projections and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels for the majority of our properties we have approval rights over budgets capital expenditures significant leases and contractual commitments and various other matters the initial term of our agreements generally is 15 to 25 years with one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager the majority of our agreements condition the managers right to exercise options for renewal upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria the manager typically receives a base management fee which is calculated as a percentage generally 23 of annual gross revenues and an incentive management fee which typically is calculated as a percentage generally 1020 of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the base management fee only is 1 of annual gross revenues but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable to starwood under a separate license agreement pertaining to the designated brand including rights to use trademarks service marks and logos matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services under the license agreement starwood generally receives 5 of gross revenues attributable to room sales and 2 of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales in addition to a base management fee as part of the agreements the manager furnishes the hotels with certain chain services which generally are provided on a central or regional basis to all hotels in the managers hotel system chain services include central training advertising and promotion national reservation systems computerized payroll and accounting services and such additional services as needed which may be more efficiently performed on a centralized basis costs and expenses incurred in providing such services are allocated among the hotels managed owned or leased by the manager on a fair and equitable basis in addition our managers generally will sponsor a guest rewards program the costs of which will be charged to all of the hotels that participate in such program we are obligated to provide the manager with sufficient funds generally 5 of the revenue generated at the hotel to cover the cost of a certain nonroutine repairs and maintenance to the hotels which normally are capitalized and b replacements and renewals to the hotels furniture fixtures and equipment under certain circumstances we will be required to establish escrow accounts for such purposes under terms outlined in the agreements we generally are limited in our ability to sell lease or otherwise transfer the hotels unless the transferee assumes the related management agreement however most agreements include owner rights to terminate the agreements on the basis of the managers failure to meet certain performancebased metrics typically these criteria are subject to the managers ability to cure and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts or in some instances waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees in addition to any performancebased or other termination rights we have negotiated with marriott starwood and some of our other managers specific termination rights related to specific agreements these termination rights can take a number of different forms including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation as well as termination without sale or other condition which may require the payment of a fee these termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by ebitda require that a certain number of properties continue to maintain the brand affiliation or be restricted to a specific pool of assets 132 host

future minimum lease payments are approximately 12 million through the full term of the leases including renewal options we believe that the likelihood of any material payments related to these ground leases is remote and in each case we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel guarantees and environmental liabilities that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet includein connection with the sale of the atlanta marriott marquis in january 2013 we retained 5 million of contingent liabilities related to potential environmental liabilities in connection with the sale of the ritzcarlton san francisco hotel in june 2013 we agreed to guarantee the hotels operating income through december 31 2016 during this period we will make support payments of up to 4 million a year not to exceed 11 million for the life of the agreement as of december 31 2013 we have accrued 11 million for the guarantee   133 host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements 17legal proceedings we are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business regarding the operation of our hotels and company matters to the extent not covered by insurance these lawsuits generally fall into the following broad categories disputes involving hotellevel contracts employment litigation compliance with laws such as the americans with disabilities act tax disputes and other general matters under our management agreements our operators have broad latitude to resolve individual hotellevel claims for amounts generally less than 150000 however for matters exceeding such threshold our operators may not settle claims without our consent based on our analysis of legal proceedings with which we are currently involved or of which we are aware and our experience in resolving similar claims in the past we have accrued approximately 18 million as of december 31 2013 we have estimated that in the aggregate our losses related to these proceedings could be as much as 50 million we believe this range represents the maximum potential loss for all of our legal proceedings with the exception of the san antonio litigation discussed below we are not aware of any other matters with a reasonably possible unfavorable outcome for which disclosure of a loss contingency is required no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings san antonio litigation on april 27 2005 we initiated a lawsuit against keystonetexas property holding corporation keystone seeking a declaration that a provision of the ground lease for the property under the san antonio marriott rivercenter was valid and claiming that keystone had breached that lease provision on october 18 2006 keystone filed an amended counterclaim and later a third party claim alleging that we had tortiously interfered with keystones attempted sale of the property and that we slandered keystones title to the property on february 8 2010 we received an adverse jury verdict in the 166th judicial district court of bexar county texas the jury found that we tortiously interfered with the attempted sale by keystone of the land under the san antonio marriott rivercenter and awarded keystone 343 million in damages plus statutory interest in addition the jury found that we slandered keystones title to the property and awarded keystone 39 million in damages plus statutory interest keystone only will be entitled to receive one of these damage awards on february 12 2010 the jury awarded keystone 75 million in exemplary damages with respect to the second claim the trial court however subsequently granted our motion to disregard the jurys exemplary damages award on june 3 2010 the trial court issued its final judgment awarding keystone i 39 million in damages for slander of title or ii alternatively 343 million for tortious interference of contract iii approximately 68 million in prejudgment and postjudgment interest as of december 31 2013 interest was 17 million iv approximately 35 million in attorneys fees expenses and costs and v an additional 750000 in attorneys fees for any appeal to the court of appeals and texas supreme court on november 23 2011 a threejudge panel of the san antonio court of appeals issued its memorandum opinion denying our appeal of the trial courts june 3 2010 final judgment in addition the panel overturned the trial courts decision to grant our motion to disregard the jurys 75 million award of exemplary damages on january 17 2012 we filed motions seeking rehearing from the threejudge panel and a motion for rehearing by the entire sevenjudge court of appeals those motions were denied on february 29 2012 on may 16 2012 we filed a petition for review in the texas supreme court and on august 17 2012 the court requested briefing on the merits briefing concluded in january 2013 on june 28 2013 the court issued an order denying the petition for review however on december 13 2013 the court granted our motion for rehearing on that order and heard oral argument on our appeal on february 4 2014 no assurances can be given as to the outcome of this appeal we have accrued a loss contingency of approximately 68 million we have funded a courtordered 25 million escrow reserve for this legal proceeding  18quarterly financial data unaudited effective january 1 2013 we report quarterly operating results on a calendar cycle which now is consistent across all of our hotel managers and the majority of companies in the lodging industry historically our annual financial statements have been reported on a calendar basis and are unaffected by this change however our quarterly operating results had been reported based on a 5253 week fiscal calendar used by marriott international inc marriott the manager of approximately 50 of our properties for 2013 marriott converted to reporting results based on a 12month calendar year during 2012 marriott used a fiscal year ending on the friday closest to december 31 and reported twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its marriottmanaged hotels accordingly our first three quarters of operations in 2012 ended on march 23 june 15 and september 7 in contrast managers of our other hotels such as ritzcarlton hyatt and starwood reported results on a monthly basis during 2012 we did not report the month of operations that ended after our fiscal quarter until the following quarter for those hotels using a monthly reporting period because these hotel managers did not make midmonth results available to us accordingly the month of operations that ended after our fiscal quarter was included in our quarterly results of operations in the 134 host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements following quarter for those calendar reporting hotel managers as a result our 2012 quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows first quarter january february second quarter march to may third quarter june to august and fourth quarter september to december we did not restate the previously filed 2012 quarterly financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap because certain propertylevel operating expenses for our marriottmanaged properties necessary to restate operations are unavailable on a daily basis because we rely upon our operators for the hotel operating results used in our financial statements the unavailability of this information on a calendar quarter basis for 2012 made restating our financial statements in accordance with gaap unfeasible accordingly the corresponding 2012 quarterly historical operating results are not comparable to our 2013 quarterly operating results
