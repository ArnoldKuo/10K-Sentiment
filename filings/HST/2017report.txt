securities and exchange commission and delivered to stockholders in connection with its annual meeting of stockholders to be held on may 11 2017 are incorporated by reference into part iii of this form 10k             explanatory note  this report combines the annual reports on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 of host hotels amp resorts inc and host hotels amp resorts lp unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires references to host inc mean host hotels amp resorts inc a maryland corporation and references to host lp mean host hotels amp resorts lp a delaware limited partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries we use the terms we or our or the company to refer to host inc and host lp together unless the context indicates otherwise we use the term host inc to specifically refer to host hotels amp resorts inc and the term host lp to specifically refer to host hotels amp resorts lp and its consolidated subsidiaries in cases where it is important to distinguish between host inc and host lp host inc owns properties and conducts operations through host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99 of the partnership interests op units as of december 31 2016 the remaining partnership interests are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners as the sole general partner of host lp host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lps daytoday management and control  we believe combining the annual reports on form 10k of host inc and host lp into this single report results in the following benefits           enhances investors understanding of host inc and host lp by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business           eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation since a substantial portion of our disclosure applies to both host inc and host lp and           creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports  management operates host inc and host lp as one enterprise the management of host inc consists of the same members who direct the management of host lp the executive officers of host inc are appointed by host incs board of directors but are employed by host lp host lp employs everyone who works for host inc or host lp as general partner with control of host lp host inc consolidates host lp for financial reporting purposes and host inc does not have significant assets other than its investment in host lp therefore the assets and liabilities of host inc and host lp are the same on their respective financial statements  there are a few differences between host inc and host lp which are reflected in the disclosure in this report we believe it is important to understand the differences between host inc and host lp in the context of how host inc and host lp operate as an interrelated consolidated company host inc is a real estate investment trust or reit and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of host lp as a result host inc does not conduct business itself other than acting as the sole general partner of host lp and issuing public equity from time to time the proceeds from which are contributed to host lp in exchange for op units host inc itself does not issue any indebtedness and does not guarantee the debt or obligations of host lp host lp holds substantially all of our assets and holds the ownership interests in our joint ventures host lp conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a limited partnership with no publicly traded equity except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by host inc host lp generates the capital required by our business through host lps operations by host lps direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of op units  the substantive difference between the filings of host inc and host lp is that host inc is a reit with public stock while host lp is a partnership with no publicly traded equity in the financial statements this difference primarily is reflected in the equity or partners capital for host lp section of the consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of equity or partners capital and in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss with respect to the manner in which income is allocated to noncontrolling interests income allocable to the holders of approximately 1 of the op units is reflected as income allocable to noncontrolling interests at host inc and within net income at host lp also earnings per share generally will be slightly less than the earnings per op unit as each host inc common share is the equivalent of 97895 op units instead of 1 op unit apart from these differences the financial statements of host inc and host lp are nearly identical  i    to help investors understand the differences between host inc and host lp this report presents the following separate sections or portions of sections for each of host inc and host lp           part ii item 5

analysis in this 2016 form 10k and in host incs 2016 annual report to stockholders contain some forwardlooking statements that set forth anticipated results based on managements plans and assumptions from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have tried wherever possible to identify each such statement by using words such as anticipate estimate expect project intend plan believe will target forecast and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance in particular these forwardlooking statements include those relating to future actions future acquisitions or dispositions future capital expenditures plans future performance or results of current and anticipated expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates or the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings  we cannot guarantee that any future results discussed in any forwardlooking statements will be realized although we believe that we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions including those discussed in item 1a risk factors should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could differ materially from past results and those results anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements  we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make or related subjects in our reports on form 10q and form 8k that we file with the securities and exchange commission sec also note that in our risk factors we provide a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from past results and those results anticipated estimated or projected we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 it is not possible to predict or identify all such risk factors consequently you should not consider the discussion of risk factors to be a complete discussion of all of the potential risks or uncertainties that could affect our business      item 1  business  host inc was incorporated as a maryland corporation in 1998 and operates as a selfmanaged and selfadministered reit host inc owns properties and conducts operations through host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99 of the partnership interests op units as of december 31 2016 the remaining partnership interests are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lps daytoday management and control  as of february 20 2017 our consolidated lodging portfolio consists of 96 primarily luxury and upperupscale hotels containing approximately 53500 rooms with the majority located in the united states and with 7 of the properties located outside of the us in australia brazil canada and mexico in addition we own noncontrolling interests in two international joint ventures approximately a 33 interest in a joint venture in europe which owns 10 luxury and upperupscale hotels with approximately 3900 rooms in belgium france germany spain sweden the netherlands and the united kingdom and a 9 indirect interest through joint ventures in five operating hotels and two hotels in the final stages of completion in india we also hold noncontrolling investments in three domestic hotels and a timeshare joint venture in hawaii  business strategy  our goal is to be the preeminent owner of highquality lodging real estate in growing markets and to generate superior longterm returns for our stockholders throughout all lodging cycles through a combination of appreciation in asset values growth in earnings and dividend distributions our strategy to achieve this objective includes          superior portfolio  own a geographicallydiverse portfolio of hotels located in major urban centers and resort destinations          disciplined capital allocation  allocate and recycle capital to earn returns that exceed our cost of capital and actively return capital to stockholders          strong asset management capabilities  create value in our existing portfolio through asset management and capital investment          powerful and flexible capital structure   maintain a strong and flexible capital structure that allows us to execute our strategy throughout all lodging cycles and 1             employer of choice and responsible corporate citizen  align our organizational structure with our business objectives to be an employer of choice and a responsible corporate citizen portfolio we seek to have a wellbalanced portfolio in major markets and premier resort and convention destinations that we expect will perform well over time therefore we focus on refining our portfolio to include multiple types of hotels in locations which we believe have strong demand generators that appeal to multiple customer segments and achieve premium rates we will look to acquisitions as well as new development opportunities to enhance our portfolio we focus generally on the following types of assets          resorts in locations with strong airlift and limited supply growth these assets feature superior amenities and are operated by premier operators          convention destination hotels that are group oriented in urban and resort markets these assets feature extensive and highquality meeting facilities and are often connected to prominent convention centers          citycenter hotels in urban and coastal markets positioned in prime locations these assets possess multiple demand drivers for both business and leisure travelers and          suburban and airport hotels that either are market leaders in prime suburban commercial locations or connected to airport terminals andor conveniently located on airport grounds we strive for diversified exposure within multiple brands focused asset classes and favorable locations as one of the largest owners of marriott and hyatt properties our hotels primarily are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry within these brands we have focused predominately on the upperupscale and luxury asset classes as we believe they have a broad appeal for both the individual and group leisure and business customers we also may invest in other property types which we believe have the potential for strong demand growth including urban select service in addition we have unbranded or softbranded properties that remain distinctive and appeal to a certain customer profile  internationally our focus is on premium assets in major western european markets through our european joint venture platform in accordance with this strategy we actively reduced our exposure to markets in the asiapacific region and in south and central america capital allocation guided by a disciplined approach to capital allocation we are positioned to make capital decisions around delivering the greatest value and returning capital to stockholders our goal is to allocate and recycle capital to enhance our portfolio and earn returns that exceed our riskadjusted cost of capital  we look to refine our portfolio through our disposition strategy generally our dispositions are focused on assets where we believe the potential for growth is constrained or on properties with significant capital expenditures requirements that we do not believe would generate a return on the investment prior to the sale of assets we may look for opportunities to increase the sale price which can include valueadded capital expenditures projects and ground lease extensions we also look to take advantage of opportunities to capture attractive pricing for hotels that have management contract flexibility we also may opportunistically dispose of higherquality assets through direct sales or through the creation of joint ventures we focus on creating and mining value from our existing portfolio through capital investments and value enhancement initiatives and by seeking to appropriately match each hotel within its specific market with the best operator and brand to optimize operating performance these projects may include significant changes to guest rooms food and beverage outlets public space and meeting space as well as a repositioning of the property under a different operator or brand we work closely with our managers to attempt to schedule these projects to minimize operational disruption and environmental impact          value enhancement initiatives seek to achieve the highest and best use of our properties these projects may include the development of timeshare office space or condominium units on excess land redevelopment or expansion of existing retail space and the acquisition of air rights or development entitlements          redevelopment and return on investment projects are designed to take advantage of changing market conditions and the favorable location of our properties while seeking to increase profitability and enhance customer satisfaction our capital expenditures projects generally fall into the following categories redevelopment projects these projects are designed to improve the positioning of our hotels within their markets and competitive set redevelopment projects include extensive renovations of guest rooms and bathrooms lobbies food and beverage outlets expanding andor extensive renovation of ballroom and meeting rooms major mechanical system upgrades and green building initiatives and certifications  targeted return on investment roi projects these projects often are smaller and focused on increasing space profitability or lowering net operating costs typical roi projects include converting unprofitable or underutilized space into meeting space adding guestrooms and implementing energy and water conservation  2    measures such as led lighting boilers solar power energy management systems guestroom water efficient fixtures and building automation systems  renewal and replacement capital expenditures are designed to maintain the quality and competitiveness of our hotel properties typically room renovations occur at intervals of approximately seven years but the timing may vary based on the type of property and equipment being renovated these renovations generally are divided into the following types soft goods case goods bathroom and infrastructure soft goods include items such as carpeting bed spreads curtains and wall vinyl and may require more frequent updates in order to maintain brand quality standards case goods include items such as dressers desks couches restaurant and meeting room chairs and tables which generally are not replaced as frequently bathroom renovations include the replacement of tile vanity lighting and plumbing fixtures infrastructure includes the physical plant of the hotel including the roof elevatorsescalators façade heating ventilation and air conditioning systems and fire systems asset management we believe we are in a unique position to work with our managers to drive operating performance and implement valueadded real estate decisions the size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading brands and operators in the industry allow our asset managers to benchmark similar hotels and identify best practices and efficiencies that can improve longterm profitability our asset managers are supported by our enterprise analytics group which provides independent underwriting of roi and valueenhancement projects business intelligence revenue management and analysis of restaurant and bar operations we also monitor and evaluate our property agreements including management and franchise agreements for opportunities to obtain additional contract flexibility over provisions such as sale rights and fee structures our goal is to differentiate our assets within their competitive market drive operating performance and enhance the value of the real estate          enhance profitability by using our business intelligence system to benchmark and monitor hotel performance and cost controls and complete deepdive analytic reviews across brands and properties to seek to identify new opportunities that could increase profit          drive revenue growth by conducting detailed strategic reviews with our managers on market pricing and segment mix in order to develop the appropriate grouptransient mix and market share targets for each property we work with our managers to ensure that their brands online presence addresses a broad customer base          work with leading brands as well as independent operators in the lodging industry we look to capitalize on situations where we have management agreement flexibility to appropriately match a hotel and its operator brand and contract terms including new or expanded relationships with independent operators our frequent evaluations of brands and operators help us to improve allocation of sales resources by our managers and allow us to help guide their digital and ecommerce strategies in an effort to drive revpar growth and reduce operating costs           improve contract flexibility through the extension or purchase of ground leases or the restructuring of management agreements  financing strategy our goal is to maintain a flexible capital structure that allows us to execute our strategy throughout the lodging cycle in order to maintain its qualification as a reit host inc is required to distribute 90 of its taxable income other than net capital gain including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash to its stockholders and as a result generally relies on external sources of capital as well as cash from operations to finance growth we use a variety of debt and equity instruments to fund our external growth including senior notes and mortgage debt exchangeable debentures common and preferred stock offerings issuances of op units and joint ventureslimited partnerships to take advantage of the prevailing market conditions           management believes that a strong balance sheet is a key competitive advantage that affords us a lower cost of capital and positions us for external growth while we may issue debt at any time we will target a net debttoearnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio or leverage ratio as defined in our credit facility that allows us to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt we believe an investment grade rating will deliver the most consistent access to capital           we seek to structure our debt profile to maintain financial flexibility and a balanced maturity schedule with access to different forms of financing primarily senior notes and exchangeable debentures as well as mortgage debt generally we look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt minimize nearterm maturities and maintain a balanced maturity schedule we may issue debt in foreign currencies to match the proceeds thereof with their intended use in order to reduce the potential costs of investing in foreign properties in terms of foreign currency fluctuation and local taxes depending on market conditions we also may utilize variable rate debt which can provide greater protection during a decline in the lodging industry           we expect to continue to utilize joint ventures to finance external growth we believe joint ventures provide a significant means to access external capital and spread the inherent risk of hotel ownership  3             throughout the lodging cycle to the extent that we are unable to find appropriate investment opportunities that meet our return requirements we will focus on returning capital to stockholders through dividends or common stock repurchases significant factors we review to determine the level and timing of the returns to stockholders include the current stock price compared to our determination of the underlying value of our assets current and forecast operating results and the completion of hotel sales  corporate responsibility our corporate responsibility strategy focuses on a set of complementary objectives across three themes           responsible investment during the acquisition of properties we assess both capital investments that may include sustainability opportunities and climate change related risks as part of our due diligence process during the ownership of our properties we seek to invest in proven sustainability practices in our redevelopment and roi projects that can enhance asset value while also improving environmental performance           environmental stewardship we seek to improve the environmental footprint of our properties we have established measurable goals to reduce energy consumption water usage and carbon emissions from across our portfolio and will continue to report on actual performance in our environmental disclosures in our redevelopment and roi projects we may target specific environmental efficiency projects equipment upgrades and replacements that reduce energy and water consumption and offer appropriate returns on investment          corporate citizenship we are committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and strengthening our local communities through financial support community engagement volunteer service and industry collaboration our approach is reinforced by our code of business conduct and ethics and periodic engagement with key stakeholders to understand their corporate responsibility priorities   in march 2016 the sustainability accounting standards board sasb issued the provisional standard real estate owners developers amp investment trusts sustainability accounting standard the provisional standard outlines proposed disclosure topics and accounting metrics for the real estate industry the recommended energy and water management metrics that best correlate with our industry include energy consumption data coverage as a percentage of floor area energy intensity total energy consumed by portfolio area total energy consumption water withdrawal as a percentage of total floor area or number of units for our calculation we use occupied rooms water intensity and total water withdrawn by portfolio area total water consumption the energy and water data we use is collected and reviewed by thirdparties who compile the data from property utility statements these metrics enable us to track the effectiveness of water and energy reduction roi projects we reference key aspects and metrics of our sustainability efforts through the global reporting initiative gri index in accordance with the gri framework and beginning in 2015 contracted with a thirdparty to provide further verification of our energy and water consumption data the charts below detail our energy intensity total energy consumption water intensity and total water consumption for 2013 through 2015 the last three fiscal years for which data is available1                         1  energy and water metrics relate to our consolidated domestic hotels owned for the entire year presented the water data excludes one domestic hotel in 2013 2014 and 2015 as reliable utility data was not available     4    the lodging industry  the lodging industry in the united states consists of private and public entities that operate in an extremely diversified market under a variety of brand names the lodging industry has several key participants           ownersown the hotel and typically enter into an agreement for an independent third party to manage the hotel these properties may be branded and operated under the managers brand or branded under a franchise agreement and operated by the franchisee or by an independent hotel manager the properties also may be operated as an independent hotel by an independent hotel manager           ownermanagersown the hotel and operate the property with their own management team these properties may be branded under a franchise agreement operated as an independent hotel or operated under the owners brand we are prohibited from operating and managing hotels under applicable reit rules           franchisorsown a brand or brands and strive to grow their revenues by expanding the number of hotels in their franchise system franchisors provide their hotels with brand recognition marketing support and centralized reservation systems for the franchised hotels           franchisormanagersown a brand or brands and also operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner or franchisee           managersoperate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner but do not themselves own a brand the hotels may be operated under a franchise agreement or as an independent hotel  the hotel manager is responsible for the daytoday operation of the hotel including the employment of hotel staff the determination of room rates the development of sales and marketing plans the preparation of operating and capital expenditures budgets and the preparation of financial reports for the owner the hotel manager typically receives fees based on the revenues and profitability of the hotel  supply and demand trends our industry is influenced by the cyclical relationship between the supply of and demand for hotel rooms lodging demand growth typically is related to the vitality of the overall economy in addition to local market factors that stimulate travel to specific destinations in particular trends in economic indicators such as gdp growth business investment and employment growth are key indicators of the relative strength of lodging demand lodging demand also will be affected by changes to international travel  lodging supply growth generally is driven by overall lodging demand as extended periods of strong demand growth tend to encourage new development however the rate of supply growth also is influenced by a number of additional factors including the availability of capital interest rates construction costs and unique market considerations the relatively long leadtime required to complete the development of hotels makes supply growth easier to forecast than demand growth but increases the volatility of the cyclical behavior of the lodging industry a recent source of supply for the industry has been the rapid growth of online shortterm rentals however the impact on the hotel industry and the availability of these outlets is more variable than typical changes in supply from hotel construction and tends to be very market specific as illustrated in the charts below for the us lodging industry at different points in the cycle demand may increase when there is no new supply or supply may grow when demand is declining  5    our portfolio primarily consists of upper upscale hotels and accordingly its performance is best understood in comparison to the upper upscale segment rather than the entire industry following the market downturn in 2008 and 2009 new supply within this segment was limited and remained well below historic levels and as a result demand increased at a greater rate than supply leading to revpar growth however as the market has strengthened supply has increased particularly in many of the major urban markets in which we compete the supply growth rate is expected to continue to increase in 2017 the charts below detail the historical supply demand and revpar growth for the us lodging industry and for the us upper upscale segment for 2012 to 2016 and forecast data for 2017  us lodging industry supply demand and revpar growth    us upper upscale supply demand and revpar growth      6    managers and operational agreements all of our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements with some of such hotels also subject to separate franchise or license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operation under the designated brand under these agreements the managers generally have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the daytoday operation of the hotels including establishing room

sheraton the don cesar          96            these management agreements can affect the value of the property associated with it based on the pricing and flexibility of the agreement we often will seek to negotiate the terms of an agreement including termination rights in order to provide greater value to the associated asset in certain instances such termination rights may only be exercisable after the payment of a fee or upon sale of a property in other instances the exercise of such termination rights may be conditioned upon a requirement that the property remain subject to a franchise agreement or may be limited as to the number of management agreements that can be terminated within a given year currently 31 of our properties include termination rights that provide us with additional flexibility we have an additional ten properties currently operating under agreements that will end within the next 20 years with no further extension options exercisable by the manager see performance termination rights and special termination rights described below  general terms and provisions  agreements governing our hotels managed by brand owners marriott hyatt hilton and accorhotels above typically include the terms described below           term and fees for operational services the initial term of our management and operating agreements generally is 10 to 25 years with one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager the majority of our management agreements condition the managers right to exercise options for specified renewal terms upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria the manager typically receives compensation in the form of a base management fee which is calculated as a percentage generally 23 of annual gross revenues and an incentive management fee which typically is calculated as a percentage generally 1020 of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the hotel in the case of our hotels operating under the w westin sheraton luxury collection and st regis brands and managed by marriott following its acquisition of starwood hotels amp resorts worldwide inc on september 23 2016 collectively the starwoodbranded hotels the base management fee is only 1 of annual gross revenues but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable to marriott under a separate license agreement as described below           license services in the case of the starwoodbranded hotels operations are governed by separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to the designated brand including rights to use trademarks service marks and logos matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services although the term of these license agreements with marriott generally is coterminous with the corresponding operating agreements the license agreements contemplate the potential for continued brand affiliation even in the event of a termination of the operating agreement as noted above the marriott licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees generally 5 of gross revenues attributable to room sales and 2 of gross revenues attributable to  7            food and beverage sales which amounts supplement the lower base management fee of 1 of gross revenues received by marriott under the operating agreements           chain or system programs and services managers are required to provide chain or system programs and services generally that are furnished on a centralized basis such services include the development and operation of certain computer systems and reservation services regional or other centralized management and administrative services marketing and sales programs and services training and other personnel services and other centralized or regional services as may be determined to be more efficiently performed on a centralized regional or group basis rather than on an individual hotel basis costs and expenses incurred in providing these chain or system programs and services generally are allocated on a cost reimbursement basis among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates or that otherwise benefit from these services           working capital and fixed asset supplies we are required to maintain working capital for each hotel and to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies for example linen china glassware silver and uniforms we also are responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds available from working capital are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels for certain hotels the working capital accounts which would otherwise be maintained by the managers for each of such hotels are maintained on a pooled basis with managers being authorized to make withdrawals from such pooled account as otherwise contemplated with respect to working capital in accordance with the provisions of the management or operating agreements           furniture fixtures and equipment replacements we are required to provide the managers with all furniture fixtures and equipment ffampe necessary for the operation of the hotels including funding any required ffampe replacements on an annual basis the managers prepare budgets for ffampe to be acquired and certain routine repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the necessary funds which budgets are subject to our review and approval for purposes of funding such expenditures a specified percentage typically 5 of the gross revenues of each hotel is deposited by the manager into an escrow or reserve account in our name to which the manager has access in the case of the starwoodbranded hotels our operating agreements contemplate that this reserve account also may be used to fund the cost of certain major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building as described below for certain of our marriottmanaged hotels excluding the starwoodbranded hotels we have entered into an agreement with marriott to allow for such expenditures to be funded from one pooled reserve account rather than funds being deposited into separate reserve accounts at each hotel with the minimum required balance maintained on an ongoing basis in that pooled reserve account being significantly below the amount that would have been maintained otherwise in such separate hotel reserve accounts for certain of the starwoodbranded hotels the periodic reserve fund contributions which otherwise would be deposited into reserve accounts maintained by managers for each hotel are distributed to us and as to this pool of hotels we are responsible for providing funding of expenditures which otherwise would be funded from reserve accounts for each of the subject hotels           building alterations improvements and renewals the managers are required to prepare an annual estimate of the expenditures necessary for major repairs alterations improvements renewals and replacements to the structural mechanical electrical heating ventilating air conditioning plumbing and elevators of each hotel along with alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required in the managers reasonable judgment to keep the hotel in a competitive efficient and economical operating condition that is consistent with brand standards we generally have approval rights as to such budgets and expenditures which we review and approve based on our managers recommendations and on our judgment expenditures for these major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building typically are funded directly by owners although as noted above our agreements with marriott in respect of the starwoodbranded hotels contemplate that certain such expenditures may be funded from the reserve account           treatment of additional owner funding as additional owner funding becomes necessary either for expenditures generally funded from the ffampe replacement funds or for any major repairs or improvements to the hotel building which may be required to be funded directly by owners most of our agreements provide for an economic benefit to us through an impact on the calculation of incentive management fees payable to our managers one approach frequently utilized at our marriottmanaged hotels excluding the starwoodbranded hotels is to provide such owner funding through loans which are repaid with interest from operational revenues with the repayment amounts reducing operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees another approach that is used at the starwoodbranded hotels as well as with certain capital expenditures projects at some of our other marriottmanaged hotels is to treat such owner funding as an increase to our investment in the hotel resulting in an increase to owners priority return with a corresponding reduction to the amount of operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees for the hotels that are subject to the pooled arrangement described above the amount of any additional reserve account funding is allocated to each of such hotels on a pro rata basis determined with reference to the net operating income of each hotel and the total net operating income of all such pooled hotels for the most recent operating year           territorial protections certain management and operating agreements impose restrictions for a specified period which limit the manager and its affiliates from owning operating or licensing a hotel of the same brand within a specified area  8            the area restrictions vary with each hotel from city blocks in urban areas to up to a multimile radius from the hotel in other areas           sale of the hotel subject to specific agreements as to certain hotels see below under special termination rights we generally are limited in our ability to sell lease or otherwise transfer the hotels by the requirement that the transferee assume the related management agreements and meet specified other conditions including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the manager           performance termination rights in addition to any right to terminate that may arise as a result of a default by the manager most of our management and operating agreements include reserved rights by us to terminate on the basis of the managers failure to meet certain performancebased metrics typically including a specified threshold return on owners investment in the hotel along with a failure of the hotel to achieve a specified revpar performance threshold established with reference to other competitive hotels in the market typically such performancebased termination rights arise in the event the operator fails to achieve these specified performance thresholds over a consecutive twoyear period and are subject to the managers ability to cure and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts or in some instances waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees we have agreed in the past and may agree in the future to waive certain of these termination rights in exchange for consideration from a manager or its affiliates which consideration may include cash compensation or amendments to management agreements           special termination rights in addition to any performancebased or other termination rights set forth in our management and operating agreements we have specific negotiated termination rights as to certain management and operating agreements while the brand affiliation of a property may increase the value of a hotel the ability to dispose of a property unencumbered by a management agreement or even brand affiliation also can increase the value for prospective purchasers these termination rights can take a number of different forms including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation as well as termination without sale or other condition which may require the payment of a fee these termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by ebitda require that a certain number of properties continue to maintain the brand affiliation or be restricted to a specific pool of assets  in addition to hotels managed by brand owners we have both branded hotels and nonbranded hotels operated by independent managers our management agreements with independent managers while similar in operational scope to agreements with our brand managers typically have shorter initial terms no renewal rights more flexible termination rights and more limited systemwide services however while we have additional flexibility with regard to these operators certain of those hotels remain subject to underlying franchise or licensing agreements these franchise or licensing agreements allow us to engage independent managers to operate our hotels under the applicable brand names and to participate in the brands reservation and loyaltyrewards systems under these agreements we pay the brand owners a franchise or licensing fee equal to a specified percentage of gross rooms revenues as well as other system fees and reimbursements in addition we are obligated to maintain applicable brand standards at our franchised hotels  operating structure  host inc operates through an umbrella partnership structure in which substantially all of its assets are held by host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and holds approximately 99 of the op units as of december 31 2016 a reit is a corporation that has elected to be treated as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code and that meets certain ownership organizational and operating requirements set forth under the code in general through payments of dividends to stockholders a reit is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level each op unit owned by holders other than host inc is redeemable at the option of the holder for an amount of cash equal to the market value of one share of host inc common stock multiplied by the current conversion factor of 1021494 host inc has the right to acquire any op unit offered for redemption directly from the holder in exchange for 1021494 shares of host inc common stock instead of host lp redeeming such op unit for cash additionally for every share of common stock issued by host inc host lp will issue 97895 op units to host inc in exchange for the consideration received from the issuance of the common stock as of december 31 2016 noncontrolling limited partners held 86 million op units which were convertible into 87 million host inc common shares assuming that all op units held by noncontrolling limited partners were converted into common shares there would have been 7465 million common shares of host inc outstanding at december 31 2016  9    our operating structure is as follows     as a reit certain tax laws limit the amount of nonqualifying income that host inc and host lp can earn including income derived directly from the operation of hotels as a result we lease substantially all of our consolidated properties to certain of our subsidiaries designated as taxable reit subsidiaries trs for federal income tax purposes or to third party lessees our trs are subject to income tax and are not limited as to the amount of nonqualifying income they can generate but they are limited in terms of their value as a percentage of the total value of our assets our trs enter into agreements with third parties to manage the operations of the hotels our trs also may own assets engaging in other activities that produce nonqualifying income such as the development of timeshare or condominium units subject to certain restrictions the difference between the hotels net operating cash flow and the aggregate rents paid to host lp is retained by our trs as taxable income accordingly the net effect of the trs leases is that a portion of the net operating cash flow from our properties is subject to federal state and if applicable foreign income tax  our consolidated hotel portfolio  as of february 20 2017 we owned a portfolio of 96 hotel properties of which 89 are located in the united states and 7 are located in australia brazil canada and mexico our consolidated hotels located outside the united states collectively contain approximately 2000 rooms approximately 3 4 and 5 of our revenues were attributed to the operations of these foreign properties in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively see note 15 geographic and business segment information in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on revenues in the geographic regions in which we operate the lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different segments each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs luxury upper upscale upscale midscale with and without food and beverage service and economy our portfolio primarily consists of luxury and upper upscale properties which are operated under internationally recognized brand names such as marriott westin sheraton hyatt and hilton there also has been a trend towards specialized smaller boutique hotels that are customized towards a particular customer profile generally these properties will be operated by an independent third party and either will have no brand affiliation or will be associated with a major brand while maintaining the majority of its independent identity which we refer to as softbranded properties we have expanded our investments to include six independent and softbranded properties where we believe it is the best fit for the hotel  revenues earned at our hotels consist of three broad categories rooms food and beverage and other revenues while approximately 64 of our revenue is generated from room sales many of our properties feature a variety of amenities that help drive demand and profitability our hotels typically include meeting and banquet facilities a variety of restaurants and lounges swimming pools exercise facilities andor spas gift shops and parking facilities the combination of which enable them to serve business leisure and group travelers  10    thirty nine of our consolidated hotels representing approximately 64 of our revenues have in excess of 500 rooms the average age of our properties is 34 years although substantially all of the properties have benefited from significant renovations or major additions as well as regularly scheduled

in florida  15    competition  the lodging industry is highly competitive competition often is specific to individual markets and is based on a number of factors including location brand guest facilities and amenities level of service room rates and the quality of accommodations the lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different segments each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs luxury upper upscale upscale midscale with and without food and beverage service and economy the classification of a property is based on lodging industry standards which take into consideration many factors such as guest facilities and amenities level of service and quality of accommodations most of our hotels operate in urban and resort markets either as luxury properties under such brand names as fairmont grand hyatt jw marriott ritzcarlton st regis autograph collection curio  a collection by hilton the luxury collection and w or as upper upscale properties under such brand names as embassy suites hilton hyatt le méridien marriott marriott marquis marriott suites pullman renaissance sheraton swissôtel and westin we also may selectively invest in upscale and midscale properties such as courtyard by marriott hyatt place ibis novotel or residence inn by marriott particularly in international markets 1 while our hotels primarily compete with other hotels in the luxury and upper upscale segments they also may compete with hotels in other lowertier segments in addition many management contracts for our hotels do not prohibit our managers from converting franchising or developing other hotel properties in our markets as a result our hotels compete with other hotels that our managers may own invest in manage or franchise  we believe our properties enjoy competitive advantages associated with the hotel brands under which they operate the international marketing programs and reservation systems of these brands combined with the strong management systems and expertise they provide should enable our properties to perform favorably in terms of both occupancy and room rates in addition repeat guest business is enhanced by guest reward or guest recognition programs offered by most of these brands we also compete with other reits and other public and private investors for the acquisition of new properties and investment opportunities both in domestic and international markets as we attempt to position our portfolio to best take advantage of changes in markets and travel patterns of our customers  seasonality  our hotel sales traditionally have experienced moderate seasonality which varies based on the individual property and the region hotel sales for our consolidated portfolio averaged approximately 25 27 24 and 24 for the first second third and fourth calendar quarters respectively in 2016  environmental and regulatory matters  under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances these laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances in addition certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of hazardous or toxic materials and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released hazardous or toxic materials environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated and these restrictions may require corrective or other expenditures in connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels we potentially may be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities although currently we are not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us we can offer no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future  employees  as of february 20 2017 we

materially affect future results and performance the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995  financial risks and risks of operation  our revenues and the value of our properties are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry  the performance of the lodging industry traditionally has been affected by the strength of the general economy and specifically growth in gross domestic product gdp because lodging industry demand typically follows the general economy the lodging industry is cyclical and this cyclicality contributes to potentially large fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers particularly during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth may create difficulties for the industry over the longterm and adversely affect our results of operations  in addition the majority of our hotels are classified as luxury or upper upscale and generally target business and highend leisure travelers in periods of economic difficulties business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel or seeking to reduce costs of their trips consequently our luxury or upper upscale hotels may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenue during an economic downturn as compared to hotels in other categories that have lower room rates for instance reductions in overall travel during the recession in 2008 and 2009 significantly affected our results of operations  other circumstances affecting the lodging industry which may affect our performance and the forecasts we make include          the effect on lodging demand of changes in national and local economic and business conditions including concerns about the duration and strength of us economic growth global economic prospects consumer confidence and the value of the us dollar          factors that may shape public perception of travel to a particular location such as natural disasters weather events pandemics and outbreaks of contagious diseases such as the zika virus and the occurrence or potential occurrence of terrorist attacks all of which will affect occupancy rates at our hotels and the demand for hotel products and services 17             risks that the recent travel ban to the united states and proposed immigration policies will suppress international travel to the united states generally           the impact of geopolitical developments outside the us such as the pace of the economic recovery in europe the effects of the united kingdoms referendum to withdraw from the european union the slowing of growth in emerging markets such as china and brazil or unrest in the middle east which could affect the relative volatility of global credit markets generally global travel and lodging demand including with respect to our foreign hotel properties           volatility in global financial and credit markets and the impact of budget deficits and pending and future us governmental action to address such deficits through reductions in spending and similar austerity measures which could materially adversely affect us and global economic conditions business activity credit availability borrowing costs and lodging demand           operating risks associated with the hotel business including the effect of increasing operating or labor costs or changes in workplace rules that affect labor costs           the ability of our hotels to compete effectively against other lodging businesses in the highly competitive markets in which we operate in areas such as access location quality of accommodations and room rate structures           changes in the desirability of the geographic regions of the hotels in our portfolio or in the travel patterns of hotel customers          changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages hotel employee health care costs prices interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs          the ability of thirdparty internet and other travel intermediaries to attract and retain customers and          decreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to inperson meetings including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks  we cannot assure you that adverse changes in the general economy or other circumstances that affect the lodging industry will not have an adverse effect on the hotel revenue or earnings at our properties a reduction in our revenue or earnings as a result of the above risks may reduce our working capital and revenue impact our longterm business strategy and impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet certain covenants in our existing debt agreements in addition we may incur impairment charges in the future which charges will affect negatively our results of operations we can provide no assurance that any impairment loss recognized will not be material to our results of operations in addition to general economic conditions affecting the lodging industry new hotel room supply is an important factor that can affect the lodging industrys performance and overbuilding has the potential to further exacerbate the negative impact of an economic downturn room rates and occupancy and thus revpar tend to increase when demand growth exceeds supply growth a reduction or slowdown in the growth of lodging demand or increased growth in lodging supply could result in returns that are substantially below expectations or result in losses which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth we depend on external sources of capital for future growth therefore any disruption to our ability to access capital at times and on terms reasonably acceptable to us may affect adversely our business and results of operations  since we have elected reit status host inc must finance its growth and fund debt repayments largely with external sources of capital because it is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of its taxable income other than net capital gain in order to qualify as a reit including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which it does not receive cash funds used by host inc to make required distributions are provided by distributions from host lp our ability to access external capital could be hampered by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control including          price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the us and global equity and credit markets          changes in market perception of our growth potential including rating agency downgrades by moodys investors service standard amp poors ratings services or fitch ratings          decreases in our current or estimated future earnings          decreases or fluctuations in the market price of the common stock of host inc           increases in interest rates and          the terms of our existing indebtedness which under certain circumstances restrict our incurrence of debt 18    the occurrence of any of these factors individually or in combination could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our future growth and on our results of operations and financial condition potential consequences of disruptions in us and global equity and credit markets and as a result an inability for us to access external capital at times and on terms reasonably acceptable to us could include          a need to seek alternative sources of capital with less attractive terms such as more restrictive covenants and shorter maturity          adverse effects on our financial condition and liquidity and our ability to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital debt service and capital expenditures          higher costs of capital           an inability to enter into derivative contracts in order to hedge risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates or           an inability to execute on our acquisition strategy we operate in a highly competitive industry the lodging industry is highly competitive our principal competitors are other owners and investors in upper upscale and luxury fullservice hotels including other lodging reits our hotels face strong competition for individual guests group reservations and conference business from major hospitality chains with wellestablished and recognized brands as well as from other smaller hotel chains independent and local hotel owners and operators we compete for customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation as well as location room rates property size and availability of rooms and conference space quality of the accommodations customer satisfaction amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points new hotels may be constructed and these additions to supply create new competitors in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms our competitors may have similar or greater commercial and financial resources which allow them to improve their properties in ways that affect our ability to compete for guests effectively and adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth we also compete for hotel acquisitions with entities that have similar investment objectives as we do this competition could limit the number of investment opportunities that we find suitable for our business it may also increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell to us making it more difficult for us to acquire new properties on attractive terms or on the terms contemplated in our business plan there are inherent risks with investments in real estate including the relative illiquidity of real estate investments investments in real estate are inherently illiquid and cannot generally be quickly sold for this reason we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any hotel that we desire to sell for the price or on terms acceptable to us or the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close on the sale of a hotel therefore we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions and dispose of assets at opportune times or on favorable terms which may adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to make distributions to stockholders in addition real estate ownership is subject to various risks including          government regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations including tax environmental zoning and eminent domain laws          loss in value of real estate due to changes in market conditions or the area in which real estate is located          potential civil liability for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties          the ongoing need for ownerfunded capital improvements and expenditures to maintain or upgrade properties          periodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements          changes in tax laws and property taxes or an increase in the assessed valuation of a property for real estate tax purposes and          force majeure events such as earthquakes floods or other possibly uninsured losses 19    we have substantial debt and may incur additional debt  as of december 31 2016 we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately 36 billion our indebtedness requires us to commit a significant portion of our annual cash flow from operations to debt service payments which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures expansion efforts dividends and distributions and other general corporate needs additionally our substantial indebtedness could           make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness           limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or to obtain financing for expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate needs on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all or           affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions  if our cash flow and working capital are not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness we will be required to raise additional funds through           sales of host lps op units or host incs common stock           the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by host lp or           sales of our assets  we cannot make any assurances that any of these sources of funds will be available to us or if available will be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient to meet our obligations or fulfill our business plan under certain circumstances we would be required to use the cash generated by any or all of the events described above to repay other indebtedness  the terms of our indebtedness and preferred units place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and these restrictions reduce our operational flexibility and create default risks  we are and may in the future become party to agreements and instruments that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries for instance the covenants in the documents governing the terms of our senior notes and our credit facility restrict among other things our ability to          execute acquisitions mergers or consolidations unless the successor entity in such transaction assumes our indebtedness          incur additional debt in excess of certain thresholds and without satisfying certain financial metrics          incur liens securing indebtedness unless an effective provision is made to secure our other indebtedness by such liens          sell assets without using the proceeds from such sales for certain permitted uses or to make an offer to repay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness          pay dividends on classes and series of host inc capital stock and pay distributions on host lps classes of units without satisfying certain financial metrics concerning leverage fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage and          conduct transactions with affiliates other than on an arms length basis and in certain instances without obtaining opinions as to the fairness of such transactions in addition certain covenants in our credit facility also require us and our subsidiaries to meet financial metrics the restrictive covenants in the applicable indentures the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt including our mortgage debt will reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt for a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsfinancial condition an increase in interest rates would increase the interest costs on our credit facility and on our floating rate debt and could impact adversely our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets  interest payments for borrowings on our credit facility and the mortgages on certain properties are based on floating rates as a result an increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes including investments in our portfolio as of december 31 2016 approximately 35 of our debt is subject to floating interest rates  rising interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures and increase interest costs on any debt that is refinanced we may from time to time enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps caps floors and other interest rate  20    hedging contracts currently the majority of our mortgages with floating rates including mortgages on our joint venture properties are fully or partially hedged through the use of floatingtofixed interest rate swaps or interest rate caps these agreements expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to dispose of assets as part of our business strategy  our expenses may not decrease if our revenue decreases  many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels such as debtservice payments property taxes insurance utilities and employee wages and benefits are relatively inflexible they do not necessarily decrease directly with a reduction in revenue at the hotels and may be subject to increases that are not tied to the performance of our hotels or the increase in the rate of inflation generally also as of december 31 2016 26 of our hotels are subject to thirdparty ground leases which generally require periodic increases in ground rent payments our ability to pay these rents could be affected adversely if our hotel revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases  additionally certain costs such as wages benefits and insurance may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period in the event of a significant decrease in demand our hotel managers may not be able to reduce the size of hotel work forces in order to decrease wages and benefits our managers also may be unable to offset any fixed or increased expenses with higher room rates any of our efforts to reduce operating costs also could adversely affect the future growth of our business and the value of our hotel properties our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations  we may acquire properties through various structures including transactions involving portfolios single assets joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits or similar real estate ownership entities we anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed with a combination of methods and a variety of sources of external capital including proceeds from host inc equity offerings issuance of limited partnership interests of host lp advances under our credit facility the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness and proceeds from the sale of assets our inability to access external sources of capital may limit our ability to finance acquisitions for a discussion of factors that may limit our access to sources of capital see we depend on external sources of capital for future growth therefore any disruption to our ability to access capital at times and on terms reasonably acceptable to us may affect adversely our business and results of operations in addition certain of these factors such as disruption in the global capital markets may limit the ability of purchasers to finance their acquisition of our hotels and therefore our ability to use disposition proceeds to finance our acquisitions we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations these adverse effects may occur because the performance of the property does not support the additional indebtedness and related interest expense that we incurred as a result of the acquisition in addition assets and entities that we have acquired or may in the future acquire may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse or only limited recourse against the sellers in general the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements may not survive long enough for us to become aware of such liabilities and to seek recourse against our sellers and indemnification covering representations and warranties often is limited and subject to various materiality thresholds a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses as a result there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with acquired hotels and entities may exceed our expectations plus we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects all of which may affect adversely our revenues expenses operating results and financial condition finally indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the assets and entities acquired by us while the sellers generally are contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities without regard to survival limitations materiality thresholds deductibles or caps on losses there can be no guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses in addition to those incurred by the sellers 21    we may not achieve the value we anticipate from new hotel developments or value enhancement projects at our existing hotels we currently are and in the future may be involved in the construction or development of hotel properties timeshare units or other alternate uses of portions of our existing properties including the development of retail office or apartments including through joint ventures there are risks inherent in any new development including          we may not obtain the zoning occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations necessary to complete the development a delay in receiving these approvals could affect adversely the returns we expect to receive           any new construction involves the possibility of construction delays and cost overruns that may increase project costs          defects in design or construction may result in delays and additional costs to remedy the defect or require a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the defect          we may not be able to meet the loan covenants in any financing obtained to fund the new development creating default risks           natural or manmade disasters may delay construction or increase construction costs          risks related to change in economic and market conditions between development commencement and stabilization          the development of timeshare units could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for residential fractional or interval ownership increases in mortgage rates andor decreases in mortgage availability market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell the timeshares for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we initially anticipated  in addition to the extent that developments are conducted through joint ventures this creates additional risks including the possibility that our partners may not meet their financial obligations or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours see we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts  any of the above factors could affect adversely our and our partners ability to complete the developments on schedule and along the scope that currently is contemplated or to achieve the intended value of these projects for these reasons there can be no assurances as to the value to be realized by us from these transactions or any future similar transactions we do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels  to maintain our status as a reit we are not permitted to operate any of our hotels as a result we have entered into management agreements with thirdparty managers to operate our hotel properties for this reason we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of our hotels such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates food and beverage pricing and certain similar matters although we consult with our hotel operators with respect to strategic business plans the hotel operators are under no obligation to implement any of our recommendations with respect to these matters while we monitor the hotel managers performance we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately the cash flow from our hotels may be affected adversely if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name because our management agreements are longterm in nature we also may not be able to terminate these agreements if we believe the manager is not performing adequately  from time to time we have had and continue to have differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements we generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations however if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to thirdparty dispute resolution failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements or the failure of our managers to adequately manage the risks associated with hotel operations could affect adversely our results of operations  in addition our hotel managers or their affiliates manage and in some cases own have invested in or provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete with our hotels all of which may result in conflicts of interest as a result our hotel managers have in the past made and may in the future make decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest  furthermore our management agreements for our brand managed properties generally have provisions that can restrict our ability to sell lease or otherwise transfer our hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions our ability to finance or sell our properties  22    depending upon the structure of such transactions may require the managers consent similarly decisions with respect to the repositioning of a hotel such as the outsourcing of food and beverage outlets may require the managers consent  the properties managed by marriott international account for most of our revenues and operating income adverse developments in marriotts business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us  on september 23 2016 marriott international completed its acquisition of starwood hotels and resorts worldwide bringing starwoods brands under marriotts management as a result of the merger approximately 78 of our properties as measured by revenues now are managed or franchised by marriott we rely on marriotts personnel expertise technical resources and information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage and maintain our hotel operations efficiently effectively profitably and in compliance with the terms responsibilities and duties of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations any adverse developments in marriotts business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties and could have a material adverse effect on us in addition the integration of starwoods brands under marriott management may expose us to additional risks and costs at our properties and will place a significant burden on marriotts management and internal resources and the potential for diversion of its attention from the daytoday business operations of its hotels including hotels owned by us we are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor  our thirdparty managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our consolidated hotels other than employing but not managing or supervising the employees at our properties in brazil and australia we still remain subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force particularly at those hotels with unionized labor from time to time hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes lockouts public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity we also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes involving our thirdparty managers and their labor force or other events the resolution of labor disputes or renegotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs a significant component of our hotel operating costs either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs as we are not the employer nor bound by any collective bargaining agreement we do not negotiate with any labor organization and it is the responsibility of each propertys manager to enter into such labor contracts our ability if any to have any meaningful impact on the outcome of these negotiations is restricted by and dependent on the individual management agreement covering a specific property and we may have little ability to control the outcome of these negotiations our hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive in the marketplace maintain brand standards or to comply with applicable laws or regulations the timing and costs of such renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments  we are required by our loan agreements or agreements with our hotel managers to make agreed upon capital expenditures in addition we will need to make further capital expenditures in order to remain competitive with other hotels to maintain the economic value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations the timing of these improvements can affect hotel performance particularly if the improvements require closure of a significant number of rooms or other features of the hotels such as ballrooms meeting space and restaurants these capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost overruns and delays in addition because we depend on external sources of capital we may not have the necessary funds to invest and if we fail to maintain our properties in accordance with brand standards set by our managers they may terminate the management agreement moreover we may not necessarily realize a significant or any improvement in the performance of the hotels in which we make these investments  our hotels are geographically concentrated in a limited number of large urban cities and accordingly we could be disproportionately harmed by adverse changes to these markets a natural disaster or threat of a terrorist attack  the concentration of our hotels in a limited number of large urban cities exposes us to greater risk to local economic or business conditions changes in hotel supply in these cities and other conditions than more geographically diversified hotel companies hotels in new york washington dc san diego san francisco boston florida hawaii atlanta and los angeles represented approximately 72 of our 2016 revenues an economic downturn an increase in hotel supply in these cities a natural disaster a terrorist attack or similar disaster in any one of these cities likely would cause a decline in the hotel market and adversely affect occupancy rates the financial performance of our hotels in these cities and our overall results of operations for example in october 2012 our operations in new york city and other east coast properties were impacted negatively by hurricane sandy in 2013 decreased us government demand for hotel rooms approximately 5 of our business in markets such as washington dc had a negative impact on our results of operations 23    the threat of terrorism also may negatively impact hotel occupancy and average daily rate due to resulting disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and concerns about travel safety hotels in major metropolitan areas such as the major cities that represent our target markets may be particularly adversely affected due to concerns about travel safety the possibility of future attacks may hamper business and leisure travel patterns and accordingly the performance of our business and our operations  the ownership of hotels outside the united states will expose us to risks related to owning hotels in those international markets  as of december 31 2016 we own directly 7 hotels located outside of the united states we also are party to a joint venture that owns 10 hotels in europe and to a joint venture that owns a noncontrolling interest in five hotels currently open and two hotels under development in india we may have difficulty managing our expansion into new geographic markets where we have limited knowledge and understanding of the local economy an absence of business relationships in the area or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures and regulations there are risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states which include           risks of noncompliance with varied and unfamiliar employment laws and practices           tax laws which may provide for income or other taxes or tax rates that exceed those of the us and which may provide that foreign earnings that are repatriated directly or indirectly are subject to dividend withholding tax requirements or other restrictions and which may affect our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a tax efficient manner           compliance with and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy           the willingness of domestic or international lenders to provide financing and changes in the availability cost and terms of such financing           rapid adverse changes in local political economic and market conditions           the ability to obtain insurance coverage related to terrorist events          changes of interest rates andor currency exchange rates and hyperinflation or deflation and difficulties in hedging these risks           regulations regarding the incurrence of debt          difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries and           difficulties in complying with us rules governing reits while operating outside of the united states  any of these factors could affect adversely our ability to obtain all of the intended benefits of our international expansion if we do not effectively manage this expansion and successfully integrate the international hotels into our organization our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected  we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts  we have made investments in joint ventures and are exploring further investment opportunities in the united states and internationally we may from time to time invest as a coventurer in other entities holding hotel properties instead of purchasing hotel properties directly we also may sell interests in existing properties to a third party as part of forming a joint venture with the third party investments in joint ventures may involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions coventurers often share control over the operation of a joint venture actions by a coventurer also could subject the assets to additional risks as a result of any of the following circumstances           our coventurer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our or the joint ventures interests or goals or           our coventurer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives  for certain joint ventures we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners disputes between us and our partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and may negatively impact operations  although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to the joint venture partners due to tax laws or other restrictions on our ability to repatriate non us earnings in a tax efficient manner additionally in some cases our joint venture partners share control over distributions and may choose to retain capital in the joint  24    venture rather than to distribute it because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us our failure to receive distributions from our joint ventures could reduce our cash flow return on these investments the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual or transient customers are booked through internet travel intermediaries search engines and peertopeer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our hotels if bookings shift to higher cost distribution channels including these internet travel intermediaries it could materially impact our revenues and profitability additionally as intermediary bookings increase these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from the brands and hotel management companies operating our hotels also although internet travel intermediaries traditionally have competed to attract transient business rather than group and convention business in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to large group and convention business if that growth continues it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and convention business consolidation of internet travel intermediaries and the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business also could divert bookings away from the websites of our hotel managers and increase our cost of sales full insurance recovery for terrorist acts may not be possible  we generally obtain terrorism insurance to cover property damage caused by acts of terrorism under separate standalone policies of insurance as well as policies on us properties which currently are subject to us federal government cost sharing as provided in the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act tripra which has been extended through december 31 2020 we also have terrorism insurance under our general liability program and in our program for directors and officers coverage we also obtain terrorism insurance to cover some of our foreign properties through insurance programs involving or administered by foreign governments we may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance policies for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts and neither us nor foreign terrorism insurance legislation or regulations ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future  while tripra allows direct insurers to be reimbursed for certain losses they incur on us properties resulting from nuclear biological chemical and radiological nbcr perils tripra does not require insurers to offer coverage for these perils and to date insurers are not willing to provide this coverage even with government reimbursement any damage related to war and to nbcr incidents therefore is excluded under policies covering our us properties moreover many of our foreign properties are not covered against nbcr perils we obtain a certain amount of property insurance coverage on our us properties for nbcr perils through our whollyowned subsidiary that acts as our direct insurer against such perils to the extent of reimbursement under tripra we ultimately are responsible for any loss borne by our insurance subsidiary  as a result of the above there remains uncertainty regarding the adequacy and cost of terrorism coverage that will be available to protect our interests in the event of terrorist attacks that impact our properties  some potential losses are not covered by insurance  we or our hotel managers carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability property business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties these policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar types of properties generally our allrisk property policies provide coverage that is available on a peroccurrence basis and that for each occurrence has an overall limit as well as various sublimits on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive sublimits exist for certain types of claims such as service interruption debris removal expediting costs landscaping replacement and natural disasters such as earthquakes floods and hurricanes and may be subject to annual aggregate coverage limits the dollar amounts of these sublimits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit in this regard hotels in certain of our markets including california florida and seattle have in the past been and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters recovery under the applicable policies also is subject to substantial deductibles and complex calculations of lost business income there is no assurance that this insurance where maintained will fully fund the rebuilding or restoration of a hotel that is impacted by an earthquake hurricane or other natural disaster or the income lost as a result of the damage our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined together for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sublimits contained in our policies have been exceeded and in the case where the manager of one of our hotels provides this coverage any such claims will be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the managers program for the same purpose therefore if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels or in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by the manager affects hotels owned by others the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or  25    sublimits depending on the type of claim have been reached each affected hotel only may receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available we may incur losses in excess of insured limits and as a result we may be even less likely to receive complete coverage for risks that affect multiple properties such as earthquakes hurricanes or certain types of terrorism  in addition there are other risks such as certain environmental hazards that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify coverage we also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier we could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel in that event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property  cyber threats and the risk of data breaches or disruptions of our managers or our own information technology systems could materially adversely affect our business our third party hotel managers are dependent on information technology networks and systems including the internet to access process transmit and store proprietary and customer information these complex networks include reservation systems vacation exchange systems hotel management systems customer databases call centers administrative systems and third party vendor systems these systems require the collection and retention of large volumes of personally identifiable information of hotel guests including credit card numbers our hotel managers may store and process such proprietary and customer information both on systems located at the hotels we own and other hotels operated by our third party managers their corporate locations and at thirdparty owned facilities including for example in a thirdparty hosted cloud environment these information networks and systems can be vulnerable to threats such as system network or internet failures computer hacking or business disruption cyberterrorism viruses worms or other malicious software programs and employee error negligence or fraud these threats can be introduced in any number of ways including through third parties accessing our hotel managers information networks and systems the risks from these cyber threats are significant we rely on the security systems of our managers to protect proprietary and customer information from these threats any compromise of our managers networks could result in a disruption to operations such as disruptions in fulfilling guest reservations delayed bookings or sales or lost guest reservations any of these events could in turn result in disruption of the operations of the hotels we own that are managed by them in increased costs and in potential litigation and liability all of our major hotel management companies and a majority of our third party operators maintain insurance against cyber threats however these policies provide varying limits and may be subject to sub limits for certain types of claims and it is not expected that these policies will provide a total recovery of all potential losses in addition public disclosure or loss of customer or proprietary information could result in damage to the managers reputation and a loss of confidence among hotel guests and result in reputational harm for the hotels owned by us and managed by them which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  in addition to the information technologies and systems of our managers used to operate our hotels we have our own corporate technologies and systems that are used to access store transmit and manage or support a variety of business processes there can be no assurance that the security measures we have taken to protect the contents of these systems will prevent failures inadequacies or interruptions in system services or that system security will not be breached through physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and attacks by hackers disruptions in service system shutdowns and security breaches in the information technologies and systems we use including unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our business our financial reporting and compliance and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties which could be significant and we do not currently insure against these losses litigation judgments or settlements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition  we are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business and are vigorously defending these claims however no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings we believe based on currently available information that the results of such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but might be material to our operating results for any particular period depending in part upon the operating results for such period we also could become the subject of future claims by the operators of our hotels individuals or companies who use our hotels our investors our joint venture partners or regulating entities and these claims could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and performance  we depend on our key personnel our continued success depends on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key personnel none of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers these  26    individuals are important to our business and strategy and to the extent that any of them departs and is not replaced with a qualified substitute such persons departure could harm our operations and financial condition  exchange rate fluctuations could affect adversely our financial results  currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position we generate revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the euro the canadian dollar the mexican peso the australian dollar the british pound sterling the swedish krona the brazilian real and the indian rupee although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of these and other foreign currencies these transactions if entered into will not eliminate entirely that risk to the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in that same currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate revenues or earnings in other currencies the conversion of such amounts to us dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our revenues or earnings  similarly changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies against the us dollar can result in increases or decreases in demand at our us properties from international travelers coming to the united states because of the concentration of our hotels in major us cities we may have more exposure to fluctuations in international travel to the united states than other lodging companies without investments located as heavily in these markets applicable reit laws may restrict certain business activities  as a reit host inc is subject to various restrictions on the types of income it can earn assets it can own and activities in which it can engage business activities that could be restricted by applicable reit laws include but are not limited to developing alternative uses of real estate including the development andor sale of timeshare or condominium units due to these restrictions we anticipate that we will conduct certain business activities including those mentioned above in one or more of our taxable reit subsidiaries our taxable reit subsidiaries are taxable as regular c corporations and are subject to federal state local and if applicable foreign taxation on their taxable income  environmental problems are possible and can be costly  our properties are subject to requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations unidentified environmental liabilities could arise and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance additionally even after we have sold a property we may be liable for environmental liabilities that occurred during our ownership federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property the owner or operator may be required to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site environmental laws also govern the presence maintenance and removal of toxic or hazardous substances these laws require that owners or operators of buildings properly manage and maintain these substances and notify and train those who may come into contact with them and undertake special precautions these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to toxic or hazardous materials  we face possible risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change we are subject to the risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change which can include more frequent or severe storms droughts hurricanes and flooding any of which could have a material adverse effect on our properties operations and business to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns our coastal markets also could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sealevels causing damage to our properties as a result we could become subject to significant losses andor repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance other markets may experience prolonged variations in temperature or precipitation that may limit access to the water needed to operate our hotels or significantly increase energy costs which may subject those properties to additional regulatory burdens such as limitations on water usage or stricter energy efficiency standards climate change also may affect our business by increasing the cost of or making unavailable property insurance on terms we find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events increasing operating costs at our properties such as the cost of water or  27    energy and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our properties against such risks there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our properties operations or business compliance with other government regulations can be costly  our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation including title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons these laws and regulations may be changed from timetotime or new regulations adopted resulting in additional costs of compliance including potential litigation a determination that we are not in compliance with the ada or other laws and regulations could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance imposition of civil penalties in cases brought by the justice department or an award of attorneys fees to private litigants compliance with the ada and other laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations  in addition the operations of our international properties are subject to a variety of united states and international laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws but we cannot assure that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international properties might be subject and the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted risks of ownership of host incs common stock  there are limitations on the acquisition of host inc common stock and changes in control  host incs

transfer of host incs assets under maryland law and host incs charter subject to the terms of any outstanding class or series of capital stock we can merge with or into another entity convert consolidate with one or more other entities participate in a share exchange or transfer host incs assets within the meaning of the mgcl if approved 1 by host incs board of directors in the manner provided in the mgcl and 2 by host incs stockholders holding twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter except that any merger of host inc with or into a trust organized for the purpose of changing host incs form of organization from a corporation to a trust requires only the approval of host incs stockholders holding a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the merger under the mgcl specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange only is required to be approved by the board of directors of a maryland corporation if the corporation is the successor entity host incs voluntary dissolution also would require approval of stockholders holding twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter           certain charter amendments host incs charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transfer and ownership of host incs stock fixing the size of the board of directors within the range set forth in the charter removal of directors the filling of vacancies exculpation and indemnification of directors calling special stockholder meetings and others all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the board of directors and approved by host incs stockholders holding twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter other charter amendments generally require approval of the board and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter these provisions may make it more difficult to amend host incs charter to alter the provisions described herein that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control or the acquisition of host inc common stock without the approval of the board of directors  shares of host incs common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share price of host incs common stock  we have in the past and may in the future issue additional shares of common stock to raise the capital necessary to finance hotel acquisitions fund capital expenditures refinance debt or for other corporate purposes sales of a substantial number of shares of host incs common stock or the perception that sales could occur could affect adversely prevailing market prices for host incs common stock in addition holders of op units who redeem their units and receive at host incs election shares of host inc common stock will be able to sell those shares freely as of december 31 2016 there are approximately 86 million host lp op units outstanding owned by third parties that are redeemable which represents approximately 1 of all outstanding units further a substantial number of shares of host incs common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans as of december 31 2016 we maintain two stockbased compensation plans i the comprehensive stock plan whereby we may award to participating employees and directors restricted shares of common stock options to purchase common stock and deferred shares of common stock and ii an employee stock purchase plan at december 31 2016 there were approximately 14 million shares of host incs common stock reserved and available for issuance under the comprehensive stock plan  29    and employee stock purchase plan and 13 million outstanding options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of 1778 per share  our earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of host incs common stock  we believe that the market value of a reits equity securities is based primarily upon the markets perception of the reits growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions whether from operations sales acquisitions development or refinancings and secondarily is based upon the value of the underlying assets for that reason shares of host incs common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may impact negatively the market price of host incs common stock our failure to meet the markets expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would affect adversely the market price of host incs common stock additionally as a result of the 2016 us elections and ongoing activity in the us congress relating to tax reform proposals there is a heightened possibility of significant changes to us federal tax laws including the possibility of lower corporate tax rates which may make investments in reits relatively less attractive than they currently are federal income tax risks  adverse tax consequences would occur if host inc or its subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit we believe that host inc has been organized and has operated in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year beginning january 1 1999 and host inc currently intends to continue to operate as a reit during future years in addition host inc owns through host lp one entity that has elected to be treated as a reit as the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a reit are limited no assurance can be provided that host inc currently qualifies as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit or that host incs subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit if our subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit it is possible that host inc would fail to qualify as a reit unless it or the subsidiary reit could avail itself of certain relief provisions new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change significantly the tax laws with respect to an entitys qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of its reit qualification if host inc or its subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit and any available relief provisions did not apply the nonqualifying reit would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates moreover unless entitled to statutory relief the nonqualifying reit could not qualify as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which reit qualification was lost  to qualify as a reit host inc is required to satisfy several asset and gross income tests our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which assets are not susceptible to a precise determination of fair market value and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals our compliance with the reit gross income and quarterly asset test requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our gross income and assets on an ongoing basis accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not contend that our hotel leases interests in subsidiaries or interests in the securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the reit gross income and asset test requirements any determination that host inc or its subsidiary reit does not qualify as a reit will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce materially the value of host incs common stock the additional tax liability of host inc or the subsidiary reit for the year or years in which the relevant entity does not qualify as a reit would reduce its cash flow available for investment debt service or distributions to stockholders furthermore the entity not qualifying as a reit no longer would be required to make distributions to its stockholders as a condition to reit qualification and any distributions made to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary c corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that if host inc were to fail to qualify as a reit host incs stockholders currently taxed as individuals would be taxed on dividends at capital gain tax rates and host incs corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the code host incs failure to qualify as a reit also would cause an event of default under host lps credit facility which default could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due thereunder which in turn would constitute an event of default under host lps outstanding debt securities  if our hotel managers do not qualify as eligible independent contractors or if our hotels are not qualified lodging facilities host inc will fail to qualify as a reit each hotel with respect to which our trs pays rent must be a qualified lodging facility a qualified lodging facility is a hotel motel or other establishment more than onehalf of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient basis including  30    customary amenities and facilities provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who legally is authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility we believe that all of the hotels leased to our trs are qualified lodging facilities however the reit provisions of the code provide only limited guidance for making determinations of whether a hotel is considered a qualified lodging facility and there can be no assurance that our hotels will be so considered in all cases if our hotel managers do not qualify as eligible independent contractors host inc and our subsidiary reit likely will fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes each of the hotel management companies that enters into a management contract with our trs must qualify as an eligible independent contractor under the reit rules in order for the rent paid to us by our trs to be qualifying gross income for the reit gross income test requirements among other requirements in order to qualify as an eligible independent contractor a hotel manager cannot own more than 35 of our outstanding shares by value and no person or group of persons can own more than 35 of our outstanding shares and the ownership interests of the hotel manager taking into account only owners of more than 5 of our shares and with respect to ownership interests in such hotel managers that are publicly traded only owners of more than 5 of such ownership interests complex ownership attribution rules apply for purposes of these 35 ownership thresholds although we monitor ownership of our shares by our hotel managers and their owners and certain provisions of our charter are designed to prevent ownership of our shares in violation of these rules there can be no assurance that these ownership limits will not be exceeded the size of our trs is limited and our transactions with our trs will cause us to be subject to a 100 excise tax on certain income or deductions if such transactions are not conducted on armslength terms a reit may own up to 100 of the equity interests of an entity that is a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the entity is a trs a trs may hold assets and earn gross income that would not be considered as qualifying assets or as qualifying gross income if held or earned directly by a reit including gross operating income from hotel operations both the reit and its corporate subsidiary must jointly elect to treat such corporate subsidiary as a trs a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than 35 of the voting power or value of its stock automatically will be treated as a trs overall no more than 25 20 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 of the value of a reits assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trs in addition the trs rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit in order to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate income taxation our trs will pay federal income tax and applicable state and local income tax and if applicable foreign income tax on its taxable income its aftertax net income will be available for distribution to us but it is not required to be so distributed we believe that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of our trs has been and will continue to be less than 25 20 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 of the value of our total assets including our trs stock and securities furthermore we monitor the value of our investments in our trs for the purpose of ensuring compliance with trs ownership limitations there can be no assurance however that we will be able to comply with the 25 20 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 value limitation discussed above rent paid to us by our trs may not be based on net income or profits in order for such rents to qualify as rent from real property we receive percentage rent from our trs that is calculated based on the gross revenues of the hotels subject to leases  not on net income or profits if the irs determines that the rent paid pursuant to our leases with our trs are excessive the deductibility thereof by the trs may be challenged and we could be subject to a 100 excise tax on redetermined rent or redetermined deductions to the extent that such rent exceeds an armslength amount recently enacted legislation has expanded the items subject to this 100 excise tax for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2016 we believe that our rent and other transactions between our reits and their trs are based on armslength amounts and reflect normal business practices but there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with our belief despite the reit status of each of host inc and its subsidiary reit we remain subject to various taxes  notwithstanding host incs status as a reit host inc and our subsidiaries including our subsidiary reit are subject to federal state local and foreign taxes on their net income gross receipts and property in certain cases host lp is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes and any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc  risks relating to redemption of op units  a holder who offers its op units for redemption may have adverse tax consequences a holder who elects to redeem their op units will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as having sold the op units the sale of these units is a taxable event and the holder thereof will be treated as realizing an amount equal to the sum of 1 the  31    value of the common stock or cash the holder receives and 2 the amount of host lps nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units the gain or loss recognized by the holder of op units is measured by the difference between the amount realized by the holder and the holders tax basis in the op units redeemed which tax basis includes the amount of host lps nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units it is possible that the amount of gain andor the tax liability related thereto that the holder recognizes and pays could exceed the value of the common stock or cash that the holder receives  differences between an investment in shares of host inc common stock and host lp op units may affect redeemed holders of op units if a holder elects to redeem their op units we will determine whether the holder receives cash or shares of host incs common stock in exchange for the op units although an investment in shares of host incs common stock is substantially similar to an investment in host lp op units there are some differences these differences include form of organization management structure voting rights liquidity and federal and state income taxation some of which differences may be material to investors     item 1b  unresolved staff comments  we have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the securities

the americans with disabilities act tax disputes and other general matters we are vigorously defending these claims however no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings we believe based on currently available information that the results of such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but might be material to our operating results for any particular period depending in part upon the operating results for such period we record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated     item 4   mine safety disclosures none     32    executive officers  in the following table we set forth certain information regarding those persons currently serving as

discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report  overview  host inc operates as a selfmanaged and selfadministered reit that owns properties and conducts operations through host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99 of its common op units as of december 31 2016 the remainder of host lps common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lps daytoday management and control  host inc is the largest lodging reit in nareits composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotel properties as of february 20 2017 we own 96 hotels in the united states and internationally and have minority ownership interests in an additional 18 hotels through joint ventures in the united states europe and the asiapacific region these hotels are operated primarily under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry the majority are located in central business districts of major cities near airports and in resortconference destinations  our customers fall into three broad groups transient business group business and contract business which accounted for approximately 60 35 and 5 respectively of our 2016 room sales transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels therefore we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than trends in leisure demand for a discussion of our customer categories see   our customers  understanding our performance  our revenues and expenses our hotels are operated by thirdparty managers under longterm agreements pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel we provide operating funds or working capital which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages utilities property taxes and other hotellevel expenses we generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month which distribution reflects hotellevel sales less propertylevel operating expenses excluding depreciation  operations from our domestic portfolio account for approximately 97 of our total revenues and 3 relate to our international hotels the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue               of 2016revenues            rooms revenue occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue the business mix of the hotel group versus transient and retail versus discount business is a significant driver of room rates     64                             food and beverage revenue food amp beverage revenues consist of revenues from group functions which may include banquet revenue and audio and visual revenues as well as outlet revenues from the restaurants and lounges at our properties     30                             other revenue occupancy the nature of the property eg resort etc and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue such as attrition and cancellation parking golf course spa entertainment and other guest services this category also includes retail and apartment rental revenue     6      39    hotel operating expenses represent approximately 98 of our total operating costs and expenses the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses               of 2016operatingcosts andexpenses            rooms expense these costs include housekeeping reservation systems room supplies laundry services and front desk costs occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages as well as on the level of service and amenities that are provided     19                             food and beverage expense these expenses primarily include food beverage and the associated labor costs and will correlate closely with food and beverage revenues group functions with banquet sales and audio and visual components generally will have lower overall costs as a percentage of revenues than outlet sales     23                             other departmental and support expenses these expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenue such as parking golf courses spas entertainment and other guest services as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments sales and marketing repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs     28                             management fees base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels     5                             other propertylevel expenses these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes ground rent equipment rent and property insurance many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels     8                             depreciation and amortization expense this is a noncash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of past capital expenditures     15      the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations it also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items taken separately these costs represent approximately 56 of our hotel operating expenses  key performance indicators revenue per available room revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved revpar does not include food and beverage parking or other guest service revenues generated by the property although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues it is considered the key indicator of core revenues for many hotels  revpar changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels as well as incremental operating profit than do changes that are driven by average room rate for example increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues such as food and beverage revenue as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services utilities and room amenity costs revpar increases due to higher room rates however will not result in additional roomrelated costs with the exception of those charged as a percentage of revenue as a result changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in revpar caused by occupancy levels  in discussing our operating results we present revpar and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and which operations have been included in our consolidated results comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage or large scale capital improvements we also present revpar separately for our comparable consolidated domestic and international both on a nominal and constant dollar basis hotels as well as for our joint venture in europe we provide revpar results in constant currency due to the number of consolidated properties we have internationally and the effect that exchange rates have on our reporting we use constant currency because we believe it is useful to investors as it provides clarity on how the hotels are performing in their local markets for all other measures net income operating profit ebitda ffo etc our discussion refers to nominal us which is consistent with our financial statement presentation under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 40    we also evaluate the performance of our business through certain nongaap financial measures each of these nongaap financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues operating profit net income and earnings per share we provide a more detailed discussion of these nongaap financial measures how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in nongaap financial measures our nongaap financial measures include           nareit funds from operations ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share we use nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share as supplemental measures of companywide profitability nareit adopted ffo in order to promote an industrywide measure of reit operating performance we also adjust nareit ffo for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt acquisition costs and litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business           comparable hotel ebitda hotel ebitda measures propertylevel results before debt service depreciation and corporate expenses as this is a property level measure and is a supplemental measure of aggregate propertylevel profitability we use hotel ebitda and associated margins to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels           ebitda and adjusted ebitda earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is a supplemental measure of our operating performance and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits hotel owners who are not reits and other capitalintensive companies we also adjust ebitda for gains and losses

of our constant us and nominal us presentation see comparable hotel operating statistics revenue per available room  in 2016 on a constant us basis revpar at our comparable hotels increased 27 compared to 2015 representing the seventh consecutive year of positive revpar growth throughout the year increased group and leisure business helped push occupancy to near record levels for our company however reduced corporate profits and political and economic uncertainty led to a slowdown in corporate transient demand limiting growth in average rates as the business mix shifted from higherrated corporate demand to lowerrated discount business during the first half of the year we also benefited from less disruption from renovations at several of our comparable properties at the same time supply growth exceeded historic cumulative average growth particularly in many of our major markets including new york houston and boston softening inbound travel from international markets due to the relative strength of the us dollar also put pressure on demand in our major markets these trends coupled with increased price transparency from online travel agencies have inhibited room rate growth revpar growth in 2016 was both rate and occupancy driven as room rates improved 10 on a constant us basis and occupancy improved 130 basis points to 785 group revenue increased 45 driven by a 21 increase in room nights coupled with a 24 increase in rates meanwhile transient demand was hampered by softening business travel and reduced international travel transient revenues increased 12 for the year driven by a 07 increase in average rate and a 05 increase in room nights sold  comparable revpar at our domestic portfolio increased 25 for the year driven by a 130 basis point improvement in occupancy and a 08 improvement in room rates los angeles washington dc and san diego led our domestic portfolio with revpar increases of 88 67 and 55 respectively driven by improvements in both occupancy and room rates in each of the markets our new york and houston markets lagged the portfolio with revpar decreases of 30 and 11 respectively during the year primarily due to the recent influx of new supply the impact of which will continue into 2017  on a constant us basis revpar at our comparable consolidated international hotels outperformed our portfolio in 2016 with an increase of 78 led by our latin american properties which recorded a 152 increase in revpar our rio de janeiro properties benefited from the 2016 olympics and paralympics while the jw marriott hotel mexico city also experienced strong improvement in average rate our canadian properties outperformed driven by increased group business in both calgary and toronto comparable revpar in constant euros for the unconsolidated euro jv properties decreased 20 for the year the decrease was due to slow economic growth and an uncertain political climate that reduced demand particularly at the joint ventures properties in brussels and paris where operations have yet to return to levels seen prior to the terrorist attacks in those cities  rooms total rooms revenues increased 08 for the full year reflecting the 27 increase in comparable revpar on a constant dollar basis partially offset by lost revenue from our 2016 and 2015 hotel dispositions and currency translation effects for our international  42    properties total room expenses decreased by 10 primarily reflecting hotel sales as well as our focus on cost controls comparable room revenues increased 29 for the full year while comparable room expenses increased only 14 as operators were able to drive profitability through improved productivity food and beverage food and beverage revenues increased 20 for 2016 reflecting the 17 increase at our comparable hotels the increase was driven primarily by growth in banquet and audio visual revenues which provide higher overall operating margins than outlet revenue as catered functions generally are more profitable total food and beverage expenses and comparable hotel food and beverage expenses increased a moderate 04 and 03 respectively which allowed for strong profitability growth  operating profit operating margins calculated based on gaap operating profit as a percentage of gaap revenues increased 80 basis points for the full year 2016 these operating margins are affected significantly by several items including dispositions depreciation and corporate expenses our comparable hotel ebitda margins which exclude these items also increased 80 basis points to 278 the improvements in both gaap operating profit margins and comparable hotel ebitda margins were driven by improvement in higher margin group business throughout the year coupled with increases in attrition and cancellation fees decreases in utility and insurance costs and the ability of our operators to improve productivity we have focused on improving productivity at some of our largest hotels over the past two years by initiating time and motion studies these studies have resulted in hotel managers establishing tighter labor model standards and improved and expanded forecasting tools which allow managers to more effectively schedule labor based on demand and to minimize excess staffing thereby reducing costs net income adjusted ebitda and adjusted ffo per diluted share net income for host inc increased 206 million in 2016 to 771 million due primarily to the improvements in operations a 158 million increase in gains on dispositions and a decrease in interest expense including a decrease of 41 million of debt extinguishment costs partially offset by an increase in income tax expense and a decline in equity in earnings of affiliates as the euro jv sold nine hotels in 2015 we also recorded a gain of 12 million for proceeds received for the disruption of operations at the new orleans marriott caused by the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill as a result host incs diluted income per common share improved 378 to 102 adjusted ffo per diluted share which excludes gains on dispositions debt extinguishment costs and other real estate transactions including depreciation increased 97 to 169 per share net income nareit and adjusted ffo and the related per share measures benefited from the following          adjusted ebitda increased 62 million to 1471 million reflecting improvement in hotel operations despite a net reduction due to property transactions including the european joint ventures 2015 hotel dispositions          per share measures improved due to the purchase of 52 million shares during 2016 and 2015 the antidilutive effect of these purchases is computed on a weighted average basis  the trends and transactions described above for host inc affected host lp as the only significant difference between the host inc and host lp statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the outside partners of host lp for the year host lps net income increased 206 million to 771 million and the diluted income per common unit increased 382 to 105 per common unit  2017 outlook  there is cautious optimism for the united states economy in 2017 in 2016 gdp growth slowed to approximately 16 while business investment declined slightly as uncertainty weighed on confidence and corporate demand however several economic indicators including improving corporate profitability and strengthening consumer confidence point to the potential for continued and possibly stronger growth this year additionally the new administration and congress have signaled or proposed several initiatives such as a decrease in corporate taxation lower regulatory burdens and an increase in infrastructure spending that may result in increased business investment although the timing of any increases remains uncertain at the same time there is an expectation that us monetary policy will tighten in 2017 leading to an increase in interest rates and further strengthening for the us dollar which could lead to continued softening of international travel to the united states  based on these trends we anticipate that us travel demand will remain stable in the nearterm strengthening consumer confidence and strong employment numbers have the potential to buoy the transient travel segment additionally demand for our  43    lodging portfolio of upperupscale properties in major markets is highly correlated to business investment which we anticipate will strengthen in 2017 however supply growth significantly accelerated in 2016 and this trend is expected to continue into 2017 in particular the markets in which we own a significant number of our hotels have experienced aboveaverage supply growth during this cycle the continued increase in supply will limit our managers ability to grow room rate in the nearterm and could lead to slight declines in occupancy additionally rate growth is inhibited by the increasing popularity of online sharing sites such as airbnb as well as online booking sites which increase price transparency as a result of these trends we anticipate that we will continue to experience high levels of occupancy in 2017 in january 2017 comparable revpar increased 74 for the month on a constant us dollar basis primarily driven by the performance of the washington dc market which benefited from the presidential inauguration and womens march however the continued pressures from increased supply are expected to inhibit rate growth leading to limited revpar improvement for the remainder of the year as a result we anticipate revpar growth for our comparable hotels on a constant dollar basis of between 00 and 20 for the full year 2017 additionally comparisons between our 2016 and 2017 results will be affected by our recent dispositions as in 2016 we recognized revenues of 166 million net income excluding gain on sale of 21 million and adjusted ebitda of 37 million for the ten properties sold in 2016 and one property sold yeartodate 2017 as noted above the current outlook for the lodging industry is uncertain therefore there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons including but not limited to slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns see part i item

lease at our key bridge marriott located along the potomac river overlooking washington dc we anticipate that the level of capital intensive redevelopment projects will decline compared to 2016 we

discussion of our markets and constant us and nominal us presentation see comparable hotel operating statistics 52    our top performing domestic markets for the year were los angeles and washington dc our los angeles properties led our domestic portfolio with an overall revpar increase of 88 primarily due to rate growth of 56 as strong group demand enabled our operators to drive rate growth our washington dc market benefited year over year from the 2015 renovations and strong citywide group demand resulting in rate growth of 32 combined with a 250 basis point increase in occupancy  many of our other west coast markets also outperformed the portfolio including san diego hawaii and san francisco the mlb allstar game and comiccon led to an increase in citywide room nights and strong group business at our san diego properties at our hawaiian properties strong group and transient demand in the market due to a combination of the zika virus threat in the caribbean and south america terrorism concerns in europe and lower airfare prices all led to revpar growth of 47 revpar growth at our properties in san francisco was due solely to rate growth of 30 primarily due to super bowl demand earlier this year while occupancy remained flat as many of our properties were negatively impacted by the construction at the moscone convention center which will continue until 2018 the phoenix market was in line with our portfolio as average rate increased 28 and occupancy remained flat meanwhile in seattle revpar was affected negatively by rooms renovation at the w seattle where occupancy declined by 840 basis points and difficult comparisons to 2015 when the city hosted the us golf association open championship   in the southern and central us our atlanta chicago and denver markets outperformed our portfolio due to a combination of rate improvement and an increase in occupancy in atlanta and denver our properties benefited from a number of citywide events during the year while our chicago properties benefited from completed renovations and strong group demand meanwhile revpar at our florida and houston hotels underperformed our portfolio concerns over the spread of the zika virus contributed to declines in both group and leisure travel at our florida properties our houston properties continued to be affected by disruption in the oil markets and increasing market supply on the east coast our boston and new york hotels underperformed our portfolio in boston there were fewer citywide events with weakening demand from the financial services and pharmaceutical sectors in new york supply growth has continued to negatively impact our hotels as well as the strong us dollar resulting in a decline in european travel trends we expect to continue into 2017  on a constant dollar basis our international markets experienced revpar growth of 78 led by our latin american properties with double digit revpar growth of 152 due to the 2016 olympics and paralympics in

driven by a combination of strong rate growth of 32 and an increase in occupancy of 330 basis points in particular the newark airport had an increase in occupancy of 139 percentage points due to lower occupancy in 2015 when the hotel was completing renovations and westin los angeles airport had rate growth of 118 due to new crew business our suburban properties also outperformed the portfolio driven by rate growth of 34 as high occupancy levels in urban markets helped drive demand toward adjacent suburban markets improvements in occupancy at our urban properties resulted in revpar growth of 18 while average rate remained flat our resort properties outperformed the portfolio with rate growth of 23 and a slight increase in occupancy of 40 basis points driven by our california and hawaii resorts  53    hotel sales by business mix our customers fall into three broad categories transient group and contract business the information below is derived from business mix results from 88 comparable hotels for which 2016 and 2015 business mix information is available in 2016 overall revenue growth was due to both group and transient growth overall group revenues improved 45 compared to the prior year consisting of a 24 average room rate increase coupled with a 21 growth in group room nights sold our hotels were able to drive group business through higherrated association business which led to a 75 increase in revenue corporate group revenue increased 58 while government and leisure group declined 29 revenue from our transient business increased 12 reflecting an increase of 07 in average rate and 05 in room nights sold special corporate rooms declined 36 as weakness in corporate business travel resulted in a negative mix shift as operators replaced higher rated corporate business with lower rated business such as contract discount or government  54    2015 compared to 2014  comparable hotel sales by geographic market  as of december 31 2015 95 of our 106 owned hotels

properties declined 74 due to disruption in the oil markets during 2015 which significantly hampered demand as well as increasing market supply and the renovation at the houston marriott medical center hotel  on a constant dollar basis our international markets experienced revpar growth of 22 led by our latin america properties with revpar growth of 91 on a constant dollar basis as strong group demand and renovations completed in 2014 led to improvements at our mexico property while the jw marriott rio de janeiro benefited from the weak real during the year despite difficult comparisons to the world cup in 2014 our canadian properties in particular calgary were affected negatively by falling oil prices and disruption from renovations which led to a revpar decrease of 106

                1  for a discussion of our property types see comparable hotel operating statistics our suburban properties led the portfolio for the year with revpar growth of 78 driven by average rate growth of 66 continuing a trend from prior year high occupancy and average room rate in urban markets has helped to drive demand in adjacent suburban markets our airport properties experienced revpar growth of 64 driven by strong average rate growth at our west coast airport properties the revpar improvement at our resort properties of 49 was driven by a 33 increase in average rate and improvement in occupancy of 110 basis points our urban properties lagged the portfolio with a revpar increase of 12 average rate increase of 10 and a 20 basis point growth in occupancy our urban properties were affected negatively by weakness in the washington dc new york and houston markets  hotel sales by business mix  the information below is derived from business mix results from 86 comparable hotels for which 2015 and 2014 business mix information is available in 2015 overall revenue growth was due to both group and transient growth revenue from our transient business increased 40 reflecting an increase of 35 in average rate and a slight increase in room nights sold nonqualified discount transient room nights increased 93 while lowerrated special corporate and government segments decreased 26 overall group revenues improved 39 compared to the prior year consisting of a 29 average room rate increase coupled with a 09 growth in group room nights sold corporate group revenue growth of 58 and association group revenue growth of 39 was offset partially by government and leisure growth of 02 56    liquidity and capital resources  liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp the liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp are derived primarily from the activities of host lp which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations the incurrence of debt the issuance of op units or the sale of properties host inc is a reit and its only significant asset is the ownership of partnership interests of host lp therefore its financing and investing activities are conducted through host lp except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock proceeds from stock issuances by host inc are contributed to host lp in exchange for op units additionally funds used by host inc to pay dividends or to repurchase stock are provided by host lp therefore while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between host inc and host lp we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion applies both to host inc and host lp  overview we look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash debt and equity in order to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry we believe this strategy will result in a lower overall cost of capital allow us to complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions and will position us to manage potential declines in operations throughout the lodging cycle over the past several years we have decreased our leverage as measured by our net debttoebitda ratio and reduced our debt service obligations leading to an increase in our fixed charge coverage ratio  we intend to use available cash predominantly for acquisitions or other investments in our portfolio if we are unable to find appropriate investment opportunities we will consider other uses such as a return of capital through dividends or common stock repurchases the amounts of which will be determined by our operations and other market factors significant factors we review to determine the amount and timing of common stock repurchases include the current stock price compared to our determination of the underlying value of our assets current and forecast operating results and the completion of hotel sales  we have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt we have access to multiple types of financing as approximately 98 of our debt consists of senior notes and borrowings under our credit facility none of which are collateralized by specific hotel properties our senior unsecured debt is rated investment grade by moodys investor services fitch ratings and standard amp poors rating service which has allowed us to borrow capital at lower rates than previously achieved in 2016 we did not issue any senior notes or incur any mortgage debt and repaid 137 million of mortgage debt additionally only one of our hotels is encumbered by mortgage debt  57    we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our portfolio withstand declines in operating cash flow pay nearterm debt maturities and fund our capital expenditures programs we may continue to access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist in order to further enhance our liquidity and to fund cash needs

borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances assuming the exercise of credit facility extensions we have no significant debt maturities until 2019  capital resources we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth including acquisitions as a result the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure our financial flexibility including our ability to incur debt make distributions and make investments is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of such indebtedness which include among other things the allowable amounts of leverage interest coverage and fixed charges  if at any time we determine that market conditions are favorable after taking into account our liquidity requirements we may cause host lp to issue senior notes or debentures exchangeable for shares of host inc common stock given our total debt level and maturity schedule we also will continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time taking advantage of favorable market conditions in february 2017 host incs board of directors authorized repurchases of up to 250 million of senior notes and mortgage debt other than in accordance with its terms we may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases privately negotiated transactions a tender offer or in some cases through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and nareit ffo per

share repurchases subject to market conditions accordingly in light of our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets we may at any time subject to applicable securities laws be considering or be in discussions with respect to the repurchase or issuance of exchangeable debentures andor senior notes or the repurchase or sale of common stock any such transactions may subject to applicable securities laws occur simultaneously  58    we continue to explore potential acquisitions and anticipate

the potential nonperformance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price we assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligation to determine the impact if any of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition we are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions access to our credit facility and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited our exposure with regard to our cash and the available capacity under

indentures governing our various senior notes issued by host lp to which we refer collectively as the senior notes indenture we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semiannually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above under the terms of our senior notes indenture our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of host lps unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host lp  pledges and guarantees under the senior notes indentures all host lp subsidiaries which guarantee host lp debt are required to similarly guarantee debt issuances under the indenture also to the extent the equity of any subsidiaries of host lp is pledged to secure borrowings under the credit facility such collateral likewise is required to secure senior note issuances under the senior notes indentures while the credit facility currently does not include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests such guarantees or pledges subsequently will be required in the event that host lps leverage ratio exceeds 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility as well as the senior notes issued under the senior notes indenture and certain hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility if triggered the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain us and canadian subsidiaries of host lp and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would not provide guarantees or pledges of equity interests further if at any time our leverage ratio falls below 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters or host lp has an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating such guarantees and pledges may be released  62    senior notes indenture covenants  covenants for senior notes issued after we attained an investment grade rating no senior notes were issued in 2016 on october 14 2015 we completed an underwritten public offering of 400 million aggregate principal amount of series f senior notes bearing interest at a rate of 45 per year due in 2026 the series f senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the february 1 2026 maturity date except at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium as set forth in the senior notes indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date  on may 15 2015 we completed an underwritten public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of series e senior notes bearing interest at a rate of 4 per year due in 2025 the series e senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the june 15 2025 maturity date except at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium as set forth in the senior notes indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date  the series e and f senior notes were issued under a new senior notes indenture and have covenants customary for investment grade debt primarily limitations on our ability to incur debt there are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends these senior notes have covenants similar to our series d senior notes but are different than the covenants applicable to our prior series of senior notes issued before we attained our investment grade rating under the terms of the series d e and f senior notes host lps ability to incur indebtedness is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions including the achievement of an ebitdatointerest coverage ratio of at least 15x by host lp as calculated this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on host lps consolidated statement of operations in addition the calculation is based on host lps pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to certain transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period other covenants limiting host lps ability to incur indebtedness include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65 of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values maintaining secured indebtedness of less than 40 of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150 of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured indebtedness of host lp and its subsidiaries so long as host lp maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture it may incur additional debt  we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants applicable to our series d e and f senior notes the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture for our series d e and f senior notes and our actual credit ratios as of december 31 2016

investment grade rating currently our senior notes have an investment grade rating from both moodys and standard amp poors as a result many of the restrictive covenants contained in the senior notes indenture and the supplemental indentures for our prior series of senior notes are not applicable as they do not apply for so long as such series of notes maintain an investment grade rating from both moodys and standard amp poors the following primary covenants continue to apply to our existing senior notes other than our series d e and f senior notes          restrict our ability to sell all or substantially all of our assets or merge with or into other companies and          require us to make an offer to repurchase the existing senior notes then currently outstanding upon the occurrence of a change of control if our senior notes are no longer rated investment grade by either or both of moodys and standard amp poors then the following covenants and other restrictions will be reinstated for our senior notes but will not apply to the series d e and f senior notes which have different covenants           our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions will be subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions including the achievement of an ebitdatointerest coverage ratio of at least 20x we will be able to make  63            distributions to enable host inc to pay dividends on its preferred stock if any under the senior notes indenture when our ebitdatointerest coverage ratio is above 17 to 10 this ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture applicable to our noninvestment grade senior notes based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility and amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan in order to establish the debt at fair value these amounts are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations          other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions would include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65 of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values excluding intangible assets and maintaining secured indebtedness and subsidiary indebtedness of less than 45 of adjusted total assets so long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture applicable to our existing senior notes we may make preferred or common op unit distributions and incur additional debt including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and make distributions when our senior notes no longer are rated investment grade we still will be permitted to incur certain types of debt including i credit facility debt ii refinancing debt iii up to 400 million of mortgage debt which proceeds would be used to repay debt under the credit facility and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount and iv up to 150 million of other debt we also will be permitted to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain host incs reit status          a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets based on undepreciated book values of not less than 125 of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other debt not secured by mortgages this coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or make distributions discussed above which consequences where we fall below the coverage level are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or make distributions but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture and          our ability to make distributions on redeem or repurchase our op units permit payment or distribution restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries sell assets enter into transactions with affiliates and create certain liens will be restricted the following summarizes the actual credit ratios for our senior notes other than the series d e and f senior notes as of december 31 2016 and the covenant requirements contained in the senior notes indenture that would be applicable at such times as our senior notes no longer are rated investment grade by either of moodys or standard amp poors even if we were to lose the investment grade rating we would be in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the senior notes indenture              actual ratio        covenant requirement

series e and series f senior notes and our other senior notes our actual ratios as reported can be slightly different  exchangeable debentures in 2009 host lp issued 400 million of 2½ exchangeable senior debentures in october 2015 host lp gave notice that it would redeem all of its currently outstanding debentures at a cash redemption price of 100 of the principal amount plus accrued interest at the time the debentures were exchangeable and the exchange price was equivalent to a host inc share price of 1245 based on host incs then current stock price the exchange value of the debentures exceeded the cash redemption price and holders of all but 1 million of the debentures elected to exchange their debentures for shares of host inc common stock at the exchange value rather than receive the redemption price at par as a result we issued 32 million shares of host inc common stock upon exchange including 87 million of debentures that had elected to exchange in july 2015 and redeemed approximately 1 million of debentures for cash credit facility on september 10 2015 we entered into the third amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility with bank of america na as administrative agent jpmorgan chase bank na as syndication agent wells fargo bank na deutsche bank securities inc the bank of nova scotia the bank of new york mellon credit agricole corporate amp investment bank and goldman sachs bank usa as codocumentation agents and certain other agents and lenders the credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to 1 billion the revolver also includes a foreign currency  64    subfacility for canadian dollars australian dollars new zealand dollars japanese yen euros and british pound sterling and if available to the lenders mexican pesos of up to the foreign currency equivalent of 500 million subject to a lower amount in the case of new zealand dollar and mexican pesos borrowings the credit facility also provides a term loan facility of 1 billion which we have fully utilized a subfacility of up to 100 million for swingline borrowings in us dollars canadian dollars euros or british pounds sterling and a subfacility of up to 100 million for issuances of letters of credit host lp also has the option to increase the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit facility andor term loan facility of the credit facility by up to 500 million subject to obtaining additional loan commitments and satisfaction of certain conditions  the revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of june 2018 with the option for host lp to extend the term for two additional sixmonth terms subject to certain conditions including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties and 500 million of term loans have an initial scheduled maturity of june 2017 with an option for host lp to extend the term for two additional years subject to similar conditions a second 500 million of term loans will mature in september 2020  neither the revolving credit facility nor the term loans as applicable requires any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity the term loans otherwise are subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees and pledges of security interests in subsidiaries operational covenants financial covenants and events of default as discussed below  collateral and guarantees the credit facility does not currently include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests in our subsidiaries or any other security and the guarantees and pledges are required only in the event that host lps leverage ratio exceeds 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility as well as the notes outstanding under host lps senior notes indenture interest rate and currency hedges and certain other hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility even when triggered the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain us and canadian subsidiaries of host lp and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would provide neither guarantees nor pledges of equity interests further if at any time our leverage ratio falls below 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters or host lp has an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating such guarantees and pledges may be released  prepayments voluntary prepayments of revolver borrowings and term loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty the loans under the credit facility are required to be prepaid in the event that asset sales reduce adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values to below 10 billion if we do not reinvest the proceeds of those asset sales in new properties at december 31 2016 we have adjusted total assets as defined in our credit facility of 19 billion  financial covenants  the credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 725x our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 175x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 125x the financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility hence so long as there are no amounts outstanding thereunder and the term loans are repaid we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the revolver portion of the credit facility in the future if we were ever to regain compliance with the financial covenants these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period under the terms of the credit facility interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan in order to establish its fair value and noncash interest expense due to the implementation in 2009 of accounting standards relating to our exchangeable debentures all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations additionally total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a net debt concept pursuant to which cash and cash equivalents in excess of 100 million are deducted from our total debt balance  we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility as of december 31 2016              actual ratio        covenant requirement for all years    leverage ratio        24  x     maximum ratio of 725x    fixed charge coverage ratio

our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will be reduced to 15x  interest and fees we pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to libor plus a margin the margin ranges from 875 to 155 basis points depending on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating we also pay a facility fee ranging from 125 to 30 basis points depending on our rating and regardless of usage based on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating as of december 31 2016 we are able to borrow at a rate of libor plus 100 basis points and pay a facility fee of 20 basis points interest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to libor plus a margin ranging from 90 to 175 basis points depending on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating based on host lps longterm debt rating as of december 31 2016 our applicable margin on libor loans under the 2014 term loan is 1125 basis points our applicable margin on the 2015 term loan for libor loans is 110 basis points other covenants and events of default the credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 60x as currently is the case in particular at any time that our leverage ratio is below 60x we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures and the limitations on acquisitions investments dividends and distributions contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture to the extent applicable while our senior notes maintain an investment grade rating additionally the credit facilitys restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and distributions generally are consistent with our senior notes indenture these provisions under certain circumstances limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain host incs tax status as a reit  the credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature and provides that upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders commitments may be terminated in addition upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default all amounts due under the credit facility automatically will become due and payable and the lenders commitments automatically will terminate  mortgage and other debt as of december 31 2016 we had mortgage debt secured by one hotel which represents 1 of our total revenues in 2016 all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except in instances of fraud misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions as of december 31 2016 secured debt represented approximately 2 of our total debt and our

approximately 16 million additionally we have noncontrolling interests in partnerships and joint ventures that are not consolidated and are accounted for under the equity method the portion of the mortgage and other debt of these partnerships and joint ventures attributable to us based on our ownership percentage thereof was 392 million at december 31 2016 the mortgage debt related to the

timeshare joint venture see offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations  distributiondividend host incs policy on common dividends generally is to distribute over time at least 100 of its taxable income which primarily is dependent on our results of operations as well as gains and losses on property sales host inc paid a  66    regular quarterly cash dividend of 020 per share and a special cash dividend of 005 per share on its common stock on january 17 2017 to stockholders of record as of december 30 2016 the 020 per share dividend represents host incs intended regular quarterly cash dividend for the next several quarters subject to board approval while host inc intends to use available cash predominantly for acquisitions or other investments in its portfolio to the extent that we do not identify appropriate investments we may elect in the future subject to market conditions to use available cash for other purposes such as common stock repurchases or increased dividends which dividends could be in excess of taxable income any special dividend would be subject to approval by host incs board of directors  funds used by host inc to pay dividends are provided through distributions from host lp as of december 31 2016 host inc is the owner of approximately 99 of host lps common op units the remaining common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners each op unit may be offered for redemption by the holders for cash or at the election of host inc host inc common stock based on the then current conversion ratio the current conversion ratio is 1021494 shares of host inc common stock for each op unit  investors should take into account the 1 noncontrolling position of host lp op units when analyzing dividend payments by host inc to its stockholders as these holders of op units share on a pro rata basis in amounts being distributed by host lp to holders of its corresponding op units for example if host inc paid a 1 per share dividend on its common stock it would be based on the payment of a 1021494 per common unit distribution by host lp to host inc as well as to the other common op unitholders  offbalance sheet arrangements and

related to uncertain tax liabilities  tax sharing arrangements under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies such as marriott international inc hms host and barceló crestline corporation we are obligated to pay certain taxes federal state local and foreign including any related interest and penalties relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us for example a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that such former affiliate was owned by us this adjustment could result in a tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement additionally under the partnership agreement between host inc and host lp host lp is obligated to pay certain taxes federal state local and foreign including any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc as well as any liabilities the irs may successfully assert against host inc we do not expect any amounts paid under these tax sharing arrangements to be material  tax indemnification agreements as a result of certain federal and state income tax considerations of the former owners of two hotels currently owned by host lp we have agreed to restrictions on selling such hotels or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods one of these agreements expires in 2028 and the other in 2031  guarantees we have entered into certain guarantees which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt that are not recorded on our books due to various dispositions spinoffs and contractual arrangements but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote for a discussion of the largest guarantees by dollar amount see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 16 guarantees and contingencies  critical accounting policies  our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates we evaluate our estimates and judgments including  70    those related to the impairment of longlived assets on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the following

for more information and          share based payments additionally see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 8 employee stock plans for more information application of new accounting standards in february 2015 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201502 amendments to the consolidation analysis the asu amends the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities vies and general partners investments in limited partnerships and modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are vies or voting interest entities the asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 specifically as a result of the elimination of the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and that these partnerships should be evaluated under the vie or voting interest model we reevaluated the vie determination of our nonwhollyowned partnerships we adopted this standard on january 1 2016 and applied the changes retrospectively as a result we no longer consolidate the partnership that owns the fort lauderdale marriott harbor beach resort amp spa of which we are the managing partner and hold 499 of the partnership interests due to the voting rights of the thirdparty owner accordingly the operations assets and liabilities of the hotel no longer are included in our consolidated financial statements instead we have included our interest in the hotel based on the carrying amount on january 1 2015 in advances to and investments in affiliates and our portion of the hotels earnings are recorded to equity in earnings of affiliates with no cumulativeeffect adjustment as a result of the adoption of this asu total assets and total liabilities at december 31 2015 were reduced by 128 million and 150 million respectively in addition for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 total revenues were reduced by 37 million and 33 million respectively net income decreased by 6 million for both years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 the deconsolidation of this entity had no effect on the total equity of host inc stockholders total host lp capital or net income attributable to host inc or host lp  additionally three partnerships now are considered vies as the general partner maintains control over the decisions that most significantly impact the partnerships however this consideration did not change the consolidation determination this conclusion includes the operating partnership host lp which is consolidated by host inc of which host inc is the general partner and holds 99 of the limited partner interests host incs sole significant asset is its investment in host lp and consequently substantially all of host incs assets and liabilities represent assets and liabilities of host lp all of host incs debt is an obligation of host lp and may be settled only with assets of host lp we also determined that our consolidated partnership that owns the houston airport marriott at george bush intercontinental of which we are the general partner and hold 85 of the partnership interests is a vie the total assets of this vie at december 31 2016 are 60 million and consist of cash and property and equipment liabilities for the vie total 3 million and consist of accounts payable and deferred revenue the unconsolidated partnership that owns the philadelphia marriott downtown of which we hold 11 of the limited partner interests also is a vie the carrying amount of this investment at december 31 2016 is 6 million and is included in advances to and investments in affiliates the mortgage debt held by this vie is nonrecourse to us in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 the new standard sets forth steps to determine the timing and amount of revenue to be recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects in exchange in march april may and december 2016 the fasb issued asus  71    nos 201608 201610 201612 and 201620 respectively all related to revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 which further clarify the application of the standard in august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201514 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 deferral of the effective date which deferred the effectiveness of asu no 201409 to reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and permitted early application for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 the new standards can be applied retrospectively or under a modified retrospective approach based on our assessment of this standard it will not materially affect the amount or timing of revenue recognition for revenues from room food and beverage and other hotel level sales however it may allow for earlier gain recognition for certain sale transactions under which we have continuing involvement upon adoption we expect to implement these standards using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect recognized and no prior period restatements in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases topic 842 which affects aspects of accounting for lease agreements under the new standard all leases including operating leases will require recognition of the lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees on the balance sheet however the effect on the statement of operations and the statement of cash flows largely is unchanged the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 with early application permitted the standard requires a modified retrospective approach with restatement of the periods presented in the year of adoption the primary impact of the new standard will be to the treatment of our 26 ground leases which represent approximately 85 of all of our operating lease payments while we have not completed our analysis we believe that the application of this standard will result in the recording of a right of use asset and the related lease liability of between 400 million and 500 million for the ground leases although changes in discount rates ground lease terms or other variables may have a significant effect on this calculation as noted above we expect that the adoption of this standard will have minimal impact on our income statement in march 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting which is intended to simplify accounting for sharebased payment transactions and will affect the classification of certain sharebased awards and related income tax withholdings the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 with early adoption permitted as a result of the standard we anticipate that the majority of our sharebased payment awards granted in 2017 will be deemed equityclassified awards and the excess tax benefits or deficiencies that are incurred based on the difference between the intrinsic value of the award and the grantdate fair value will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the income statement however we do not anticipate that the implementation of this standard will have a material effect on our financial statements in november 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash which requires that on the statement of cash flows amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending total amounts thereof upon adoption of this standard amounts included in restricted cash and furniture fixtures and equipment replacement fund on our consolidated balance sheet will be included with cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows these amounts totaled 175 million and 156 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the adoption of this standard will not change our balance sheet presentation the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption permitted we plan to adopt this standard beginning january 1 2017 in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201701 business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business the standard adopts a twostep approach wherein if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single group of similar identifiable assets then the transaction would be considered an asset purchase as a result of the standard we anticipate that the majority of our hotel purchases will be considered asset purchases as opposed to business combinations although the determination will be made on a transactionbytransaction basis this standard will be applied on a prospective basis and therefore it does not affect the accounting for any of our previous transactions the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption permitted our customers  our customers fall into three broad groups transient business group business and contract business similar to the majority of the lodging industry we further categorize business within these broad groups based on characteristics they have in common as follows  transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels therefore we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than trends in leisure demand the four key subcategories of the transient business group are           retail this is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the general public it typically is the rate charged to travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discounted rates it includes the rack rate which typically is applied to rooms during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available retail room rates will fluctuate more freely depending on anticipated demand levels eg seasonality and weekday vs weekend stays  72             nonqualified discount these include special rates offered by the hotels including packages advancepurchase discounts and promotional offers these also include rooms booked through online travel agencies otas           special corporate this is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally these rates typically are negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated retail rate in addition this category includes rates offered at the prevailing per diem for approved government travel          qualified discount this category encompasses all discount programs such as aaa and aarp discounts rooms booked through wholesale channels frequent guest program redemptions and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel  group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together usually with a minimum of 10 rooms the three key subcategories of the group business category are           association group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions           corporate group business related to corporate meetings eg product launches training programs contract negotiations and presentations           other group business predominately related to social military education religious fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams otherwise known as smerf business  contract business refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our airport hotels additionally contract rates may be utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand  comparable hotel operating statistics  to facilitate a yeartoyear comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics ie revpar average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues expenses hotel ebitda and associated margins for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance  because these statistics and operating results relate only to our hotel properties they exclude results for our nonhotel properties and other real estate investments we define our comparable hotels as properties         i  that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and         ii  that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone largescale capital projects as further defined below during the reporting periods being compared  the hotel business is capitalintensive and renovations are a regular part of the business generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels a large scale capital project that would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set is an extensive renovation of several core aspects of the hotel such as rooms meeting space lobby bars restaurants and other public spaces both quantitative and qualitative factors are taken into consideration in determining if the renovation would cause a hotel to be removed from the comparable hotel set including unusual or exceptional circumstances such as a reduction or increase in room count rebranding a significant alteration of the business operations or the closing of the hotel during the renovation  we do not include an acquired hotel in our comparable hotel set until the operating results for that hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year for example we acquired the don cesar in february 2017 the hotel will not be included in our comparable hotel set until january 1 2019 hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption or commence a largescale capital project in each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after completion of the repair of the property damage or cessation of the business interruption or the completion of largescale capital projects as applicable  of the 96 hotels that we owned on december 31

historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap within the meaning of applicable sec rules these measures are as follows i ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp ii funds from operations ffo and ffo per diluted share both nareit and adjusted as a measure of performance for host inc and iii comparable hotel property level operating results as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp  75    we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the nareit definition of ffo or do not calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance in addition although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to nonreits we also calculate adjusted ffo per diluted share which measure is not in accordance with nareit guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other reits ebitda and adjusted ebitda as presented also may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with gaap cash expenditures for various longterm assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures interest expense for ebitda and adjusted ebitda purposes only and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the ebitda adjusted ebitda nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share presentations management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our nongaap financial measures additionally nareit ffo per diluted share adjusted ffo per diluted share ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions in addition nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as a measure of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders benefit  similarly adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and noncontrolling partners in consolidated partnerships our equity investments primarily consist of our approximate onethird interest in a european joint venture a 25 interest in an asian joint venture a 67 ownership in a joint venture that owns a vacation ownership property in hawaii and interests ranging from 11 to 50 in three partnerships that each own one hotel due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities the noncontrolling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1 interest in host lp held by outside partners and interests ranging from 15 to 48 held by outside partners in three partnerships each owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations these pro rata results for adjusted ebitda were calculated as set forth in the definition below under equity investment adjustments and consolidated partnership adjustments similar adjustments were made in the calculation of both nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated and nonconsolidated partnerships may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance  ebitda and adjusted ebitda  ebitda  earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries management believes ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization management also believes the use of ebitda facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits hotel owners that are not reits and other capitalintensive companies management uses ebitda to evaluate propertylevel results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs  adjusted ebitda  historically management has adjusted ebitda when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of adjusted ebitda when combined with the primary gaap presentation of net income is beneficial to an investors complete understanding of our operating performance adjusted ebitda also is a relevant measure in calculating certain credit ratios we adjust ebitda for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as adjusted ebitda           real estate transactions  we exclude the effect of gains and losses including the amortization of deferred gains recorded on the disposition or acquisition of depreciable assets and property insurance gains in our consolidated statement of operations because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets in addition material gains or losses from the depreciated book value of the disposed assets could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value often does not reflect its market value as noted below for ffo  76             equity investment adjustments  we exclude the equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated investments in partnerships and joint ventures as presented in our consolidated statement of operations because it includes our pro rata portion of depreciation amortization and interest expense which are excluded from ebitda we include our pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our equity investments as we believe this more accurately reflects the performance of our investments the pro rata adjusted ebitda of equity investments is defined as the ebitda of our equity investments adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by our percentage ownership in the partnership or joint venture           consolidated partnership adjustments  we deduct the noncontrolling partners pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our consolidated partnerships as this reflects the noncontrolling owners interest in the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships the pro rata adjusted ebitda of noncontrolling partners is defined as the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by the noncontrolling partners positions in the partnership or joint venture           cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  infrequently the financial accounting standards board fasb promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle we exclude these onetime adjustments because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period           impairment losses  we exclude the effect of impairment expense recorded because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets in addition we believe that impairment expense which is based on historical cost book values is similar to gains losses on dispositions and depreciation expense both of which also are excluded from ebitda           acquisition costs  under gaap costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company           litigation gains and losses  effective april 1 2013 we have excluded the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business which is consistent with the definition of adjusted ffo that we adopted effective january 1 2011 we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance in unusual circumstances we also may adjust ebitda for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance for example in 2013 management excluded the 11 million gain from the eminent domain claim for land for which we received the cash proceeds in 2007 but pending the resolution of certain contingencies was not recognized until 2013 typically gains from the disposition of nondepreciable property are included in the determination of adjusted ebitda the following table provides a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda in millions  reconciliation of net income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda for host inc and host lp              year

additionally in 2016 these line items include 12 million for the reimbursement of operating losses at the new orleans marriott due to the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill      2  reflects the sale of ten hotels in 2016 and the sale of eight hotels in 2015  nareit ffo nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share we present nareit ffo and nareit ffo per diluted share as nongaap measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share as our nareit ffo defined as set forth below for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with nareit guidelines nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains losses from sales of real estate the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles real estaterelated depreciation amortization and impairments and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the ffo of those entities on the same basis  we believe that nareit ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of nareit ffo per diluted share when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairments and gains and losses from sales of real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other reits even though nareit ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as noted by nareit in its april 2002 white paper on funds from operations since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves for these reasons nareit adopted the ffo metric in order to promote an industrywide measure of reit operating performance  we also present adjusted ffo per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs we believe that the presentation of adjusted ffo per diluted share when combined with both the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share and ffo per diluted share as defined by nareit provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investors complete understanding of our operating performance we adjust nareit ffo per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as adjusted ffo per diluted share           gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period we also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock we believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs           acquisition costs under gaap costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company           litigation gains and losses  we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance  in unusual circumstances we also may adjust nareit ffo for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance for example in 2013 management excluded the 11 million gain from the eminent domain claim for land for which we received the cash proceeds in 2007 but pending the resolution of certain contingencies was not recognized

margin on a comparable hotel or same store basis as supplemental information for investors our comparable hotel results present operating results for hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions significant property damage or large scale capital improvements during these periods we present comparable hotel ebitda to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable properties after removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and its asset base primarily depreciation and amortization other corporatelevel costs and expenses are also removed to arrive at propertylevel results we believe these propertylevel results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels we eliminate depreciation and amortization because even though depreciation and amortization are propertylevel expenses these noncash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves  as a result of the elimination of corporatelevel costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance  we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the periodtoperiod performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners in particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues andor expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of these hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results for these reasons we believe that comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management  80    the following table

consolidation  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of host inc host lp and their subsidiaries and controlled affiliates including joint ventures and partnerships we consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability to control the entity for the majority of our hotel and real estate investments we consider those control rights to be i approval or amendment of developments plans ii financing decisions iii approval or amendments of operating budgets and iv investment strategy decisions  we also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they are variable interest entities vies if a subsidiary is a vie it is subject to the consolidation framework specifically for vies typically the entity that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance would consolidate the vie we consider an entity a vie if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support we review our subsidiaries and affiliates at least annually to determine if i they should be considered vies and ii whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in the characteristics of these entities  102  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements   in february 2015 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201502 amendments to the consolidation analysis the asu amends the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities vies and general partners investments in limited partnerships and modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are vies or voting interest entities the asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 specifically as a result of the elimination of the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and that these partnerships should be evaluated under the vie or voting interest model we reevaluated the vie determination of our nonwhollyowned partnerships we adopted this standard on january 1 2016 and applied the changes retrospectively as a result we no longer consolidate the partnership that owns the fort lauderdale marriott harbor beach resort amp spa of which we are the managing partner and hold 499 of the partnership interests due to the voting rights of the thirdparty owner accordingly the operations assets and liabilities of the hotel no longer are included in our consolidated financial statements instead we have included our interest in the hotel based on the carrying amount on january 1 2015 in advances to and investments in affiliates and our portion of the hotels earnings are recorded to equity in earnings of affiliates with no cumulativeeffect adjustment as a result of the adoption of this asu total assets and total liabilities at december 31 2015 were reduced by 128 million and 150 million respectively in addition for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 total revenues were reduced by 37 million and 33 million respectively net income decreased by 6 million for both years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 the deconsolidation of this entity had no effect on the total equity of host inc stockholders total host lp capital or net income attributable to host inc or host lp  additionally three partnerships now are considered vies as the general partner maintains control over the decisions that most significantly impact the partnerships however this consideration did not change the consolidation determination this conclusion includes the operating partnership host lp which is consolidated by host inc of which host inc is the general partner and holds 99 of the limited partner interests host incs sole significant asset is its investment in host lp and consequently substantially all of host incs assets and liabilities represent assets and liabilities of host lp all of host incs debt is an obligation of host lp and may be settled only with assets of host lp we also determined that our consolidated partnership that owns the houston airport marriott at george bush intercontinental of which we are the general partner and hold 85 of the partnership interests is a vie the total assets of this vie at december 31 2016 are 60 million and consist of cash and property and equipment liabilities for the vie total 3 million and consist of accounts payable and deferred revenue the unconsolidated partnership that owns the philadelphia marriott downtown of which we hold 11 of the limited partner interests also is a vie the carrying amount of this investment at december 31 2016 is 6 million and is included in advances to and investments in affiliates the mortgage debt held by this vie is nonrecourse to us  use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates  cash and cash equivalents  we consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents  restricted cash  restricted cash may include reserves for debt service real estate taxes insurance and furniture fixtures and equipment replacement as well as cash collateral and excess cash flow deposits due to mortgage debt agreement restrictions and provisions and a reserve required for potential legal damages for purposes of the statements of cash flows changes in restricted cash caused by changes in required legal reserves are shown as operating activities changes in restricted cash caused by using such funds for furniture fixtures and equipment replacement are shown as investing activities the remaining changes in restricted cash are the direct result of restrictions under our loan agreements and are reflected in cash flows from financing activities  property and equipment  generally property and equipment is recorded at cost for properties we develop cost includes interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction for property and equipment acquired in a business combination we record the assets based on their fair value as of the acquisition date replacements and improvements and capital leases are capitalized while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred  103  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements   we capitalize certain inventory such as china glass silver and linen at the time of a hotel opening or acquisition or when significant inventory is purchased in conjunction with a major rooms renovation or when the number of rooms or meeting space at a hotel is expanded these amounts then are amortized over the estimated useful life of three years subsequent replacement purchases are expensed when placed in service  we maintain a furniture fixtures and equipment replacement fund for renewal and replacement capital expenditures at our hotels which generally is funded with 5 of property revenues  impairment testing we analyze our consolidated properties for impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we consider a property to be impaired when the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset we test for impairment in several situations including when a property has a current or projected loss from operations when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when other events trends contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable for impaired assets we record an impairment expense equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value to the extent that a property has a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that it is more likely than not that the property will be disposed of prior to the end of its useful life it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the propertys carrying value in the absence of other factors we assume that the estimated life is equal to the gaap depreciable life because of the continuous property maintenance and improvement capital expenditures required under our management agreements we adjust our assumptions with respect to the remaining useful life of the property if situations dictate otherwise such as an expiring ground lease or that it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold prior to its previously expected useful life we also consider the effect of regular renewal and replacement capital expenditures on the estimated life of our properties including critical infrastructure which regularly is maintained and then replaced at the end of its useful life  in the evaluation of the impairment of our assets we make many assumptions and estimates including          projected cash flows both from operations and from the eventual disposition          the expected useful life and holding period of the asset          the future required capital expenditures and           fair values including consideration of capitalization rates discount rates and comparable selling prices as well as available thirdparty appraisals  while we consider all of the above indicators as preliminary indicators to determine if the carrying value may not be recovered by undiscounted cash flows we reviewed the actual yeartodate and the projected cash flows from operations in order to identify properties with actual or projected annual operating losses or minimal operating profit as of december 31 2016 the projected cash flows consider items such as booking pace occupancy room rate and propertylevel operating costs as a result of our review we identified no properties that required further consideration of property and market specific conditions or factors to determine if it was impaired if any properties had been identified we use an undiscounted cash flow analysis considering a range of revpar and operating margins compared to the prior years operating results in evaluating the probabilityweighted projected cash flows from operations to appropriately evaluate if the carrying value of the asset is recoverable we project cash flows at a stabilized growth rate over its remaining estimated life using assumptions and estimates that we believe reflect current market conditions no impairment was recorded in 2016 and 2015 during 2014 we recognized impairment expense of 6 million on one property which is included in depreciation and amortization  classification of assets as held for sale we will classify a hotel as held for sale when the sale thereof is probable will be completed within one year and actions to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that the sale will not occur this policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner we typically classify assets as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met          host incs board of directors has approved the sale to the extent that the dollar amount of the sale requires board approval           a binding agreement to sell the property has been signed under which the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and  104  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements            no significant financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner  if these criteria are met we will cease recording depreciation and will record an impairment expense if the fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount of the hotel we will classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the balance sheet gains on sales of properties are recognized at the time of sale or are deferred and recognized as income in subsequent periods as conditions requiring deferral are satisfied or expire without further cost to us  discontinued operations we generally include the operations of a disposed hotel or a hotel that has been classified as held for sale in continuing operations including the gain or loss on the sale unless the sale represents a strategic shift that will have a major impact on our operations and financial results we adopted this policy as of january 1 2014 following the issuance of asu 201408 presentation of financial statements topic 205 and property plant and equipment topic 360  reporting discontinued operations and disclosure of disposal of components of an entity and no prior year restatements were permitted  asset retirement obligations we recognize the fair value of any liability for conditional asset retirement obligations including environmental remediation liabilities when incurred which generally is upon acquisition construction or development andor through the normal operation of the asset if sufficient information exists with which to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation  depreciation and amortization expense we depreciate our property and equipment using the straightline method depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets as well as specific market and economic conditions while management believes its estimates are reasonable a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels  intangible assets and acquired liabilities  in conjunction with our acquisitions we may identify intangible assets and other liabilities these identifiable intangible assets and liabilities typically include above and below market contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements which are recorded at fair value these contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the contract intangible assets and liabilities are amortized using the straightline method over the remaining noncancelable term of the related agreements  noncontrolling interests  other consolidated partnerships as of december 31 2016 we consolidate four majorityowned partnerships that have thirdparty noncontrolling ownership interests the thirdparty partnership interests are included in noncontrolling interestother consolidated partnerships on the consolidated balance sheets and totaled 39 million and 40 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively one of the partnerships has a finite life that terminates in 2095 and the associated noncontrolling interests are mandatorily redeemable at the end of but not prior to the finite life  net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated partnerships is included in our determination of net income loss net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of third parties was immaterial for each of the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014  host incs treatment of the noncontrolling interests of host lp host inc adjusts the noncontrolling interests of host lp each period so that the amount presented equals the greater of its carrying value based on its historical cost or its redemption value the historical cost is based on the proportional relationship between the historical cost of equity held by our common stockholders relative to that of the unitholders of host lp the redemption value is based on the amount of cash or host inc stock at our option that would be paid to the noncontrolling interests of host lp if it were terminated we have estimated that the redemption value is equivalent to the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the op units currently owned by unrelated third parties one op unit may be exchanged for 1021494 shares of host inc common stock valued at the market price of host inc common stock at the balance sheet date noncontrolling interests of host lp are classified in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet as they do not meet the requirements for equity classification because the redemption feature requires the delivery of registered shares  105  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements   the table below details the historical cost and redemption values for the noncontrolling interests              as of december 31             2016        2015       op units outstanding millions        86           91       market price per host inc common share       1884

income loss is allocated to the noncontrolling interests of host lp based on their weighted average ownership percentage during the period net income attributable to host inc has been reduced by the amount attributable to noncontrolling interests in host lp which totaled 9 million 7 million and 9 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively  investments in affiliates  otherthantemporary impairment of an investment we perform an analysis for our equity method investments for impairment based on the occurrence of triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an otherthantemporary basis triggering events can include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment a change in the expected useful life or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel properties therefore generally we will have few observable inputs and will determine fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment as well as consideration of the impact of other elements ie control premiums etc we use certain inputs such as available thirdparty appraisals and forecast net operating income for the hotel properties to estimate the expected cash flows if an equity method investment is impaired and that impairment is determined to be other than temporary an expense is recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the investment no otherthantemporary impairment was recorded in 2016 2015 or 2014 distributions from investments in affiliates we classify the distributions from our equity investments in the statements of cash flows based upon an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances of each distribution for example distributions from cash generated by property operations are classified as cash flows from operating activities however distributions received as a result of property sales are classified as cash flows from investing activities  income taxes  host inc has elected to be treated as a reit effective january 1 1999 pursuant to the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended it is our intention to continue to comply with the reit qualification requirements and to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit a corporation that elects reit status and meets certain tax law requirements regarding the distribution of its taxable income to its stockholders as prescribed by applicable tax laws and complies with certain other requirements relating primarily to the composition of its assets and the sources of its revenues generally is not subject to federal and state income taxation on its operating income that is distributed to its stockholders as a partnership for federal income tax purposes host lp is not subject to federal income tax host lp is however subject to state local and foreign income and franchise tax in certain jurisdictions additionally each of the host lp taxable reit subsidiaries is taxable as a regular c corporation subject to federal state and foreign income tax our consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes the income tax provision or benefit related to the operations of our taxable reit subsidiaries and state local and foreign income and franchise taxes incurred by host lp and its subsidiaries  deferred tax assets and liabilities under the partnership agreement host lp generally is required to reimburse host inc for any tax payments it is required to make accordingly the tax information included herein represents disclosures regarding host inc and its subsidiaries deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for net operating loss capital loss interest expense and tax credit carryovers deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which such amounts are expected to be realized or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted however deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available  106  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements   evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies  gaap prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return we must determine whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position once it is determined that a position meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold the position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement in order to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements this accounting standard applies to all tax positions related to income taxes we recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses  deferred charges  financing costs related to longterm debt are deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the debt using the effective interest method these costs are presented as a direct deduction from their related liabilities on the balance sheets   foreign currency translation  as of december 31 2016 our international operations consist of hotels located in australia brazil canada and mexico as well as investments in the euro jv and the asiapacific jv the financial statements of these hotels and our investments therein are maintained in their functional currency which generally is the local currency and their operations are translated to us dollars using the average exchange rates for the period the assets and liabilities of the hotels and the investments therein are translated to us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments are reflected in other comprehensive income loss  foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency for each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at period end exchange rates the resulting exchange differences are recorded in gain loss on foreign currency transactions and derivatives on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations except when recorded in other comprehensive income loss as qualifying net investment hedges  derivative instruments  we are subject to market exposures in several aspects of our business and may enter into derivative instruments in order to hedge the effect of these market exposures on our operations potential market exposures for which we may use derivative instruments to hedge include i changes in the fair value of our international investments due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates ii changes in the fair value of our fixedrate debt due to changes in the underlying interest rates and iii variability in interest payments due to changes in the underlying interest rate of our floatingrate debt derivative instruments are subject to fair value reporting at each reporting date and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income loss or other comprehensive income loss based on the applicable hedge accounting guidance we estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use of third party valuations which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted future cash payments prior to entering into the derivative instrument we evaluate whether the transaction will qualify for hedge accounting and continue to evaluate hedge effectiveness throughout the life of the instrument derivative instruments that meet the requirements for hedge accounting are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with offsetting changes recorded to net income loss or other comprehensive income loss based on the applicable hedge accounting guidance we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to reflect as applicable our own nonperformance risk or the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements in adjusting the fair value of our derivative instruments for the effect of nonperformance risk we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings thresholds mutual puts and accumulated guarantees the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves the values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change  107  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements   accumulated other comprehensive income loss  the components of total

loss due to foreign currency translation of 3 million that had been recognized previously in other comprehensive income loss upon the sale of the delta meadowvale hotel amp conference centre and three hotels in new zealand the losses were recognized as a reduction to the gain on sale of assets  revenues  our results of operations include revenues and expenses of our hotels revenues are recognized when the services are provided additionally we collect sales use occupancy and similar taxes at our hotels which we present on a net basis excluded from revenues on our statements of operations  fair value measurement in evaluating the fair value of both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities gaap outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market assumptions based on market data observable inputs and a reporting entitys own assumptions about market data unobservable inputs fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date in an orderly transaction an exit price assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy the three levels are as follows  level 1  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date an active market is defined as a market in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing on an ongoing basis  level 2  inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active markets with few transactions inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability ie interest rates yield curves etc and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data correlation or other means  level 3  unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the pricing of an asset or liability when observable inputs are not available  host inc earnings per common share  basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of host inc common stock outstanding diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders as adjusted for potentially dilutive securities by the weighted average number of shares of host inc common stock outstanding plus other potentially dilutive securities dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans other noncontrolling interests that have the option to convert their limited

were approximately 25 million potentially dilutive units on a weighted average basis for the year ended december 31 2015 related to our exchangeable senior debentures which were antidilutive for the period the exchangeable senior debentures were redeemed in 2015 and host lp issued 313 million units  sharebased payments  at december 31 2016 host inc maintained two stockbased employee compensation plans upon the issuance of hosts common stock under the compensation plans host lp will issue to host inc common op units of an equivalent value these liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements for host inc and host lp  we recognize costs resulting from host incs sharebased payment transactions over their vesting periods we classify sharebased payment awards granted in exchange for employee services either as equityclassified awards or liabilityclassified awards based upon cash settlement options equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period awards are classified as liabilities to the extent that settlement features allow the recipient to determine the percentage of the restricted stock awards to be withheld to meet the recipients income tax withholding requirements as these awards vest over a oneyear period ending december 31 the value is calculated as the estimated number of shares earned during the year multiplied by the stock price at year end less estimated forfeitures for performancebased awards compensation cost will be recognized when the achievement of the performance condition is considered probable if a performance condition has more than one outcome that is probable recognition of compensation cost will be based on the condition that is the most likely outcome no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite services effective january 1 2017 we implemented a new stockbased employee compensation plan based upon the cash settlement options and in conjunction with the adoption of asu no 201609 we anticipate that the awards under the new plan will be classified as equity the plan includes awards that vest over a oneyear twoyear and threeyear period  concentrations of credit risk  financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents we are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions access to our credit facility and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts at december 31 2016 and 2015 our exposure to risk related to our derivative instruments totaled 12 million and 17 million respectively and the counterparties to such instruments are investment grade financial institutions our credit risk exposure with regard to our cash and the available capacity under the revolver portion of our credit facility is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions  110  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements   business combinations  we recognize identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in a business combination at their fair values at the acquisition date based on the exit price ie the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we evaluate several factors including market data for similar assets expected cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair value of our assets property and equipment are recorded at fair value and such fair value is allocated to buildings improvements furniture fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties acquisitionrelated costs such as due diligence legal and accounting fees are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets  other items that we evaluate in a business combination include identifiable intangible assets capital lease assets and obligations and goodwill identifiable intangible assets typically consist of assumed contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements which are recorded at fair value capital lease obligations that are assumed as part of the acquisition of a leasehold interest are measured at fair value and are included as debt on the accompanying balance sheet and we record the corresponding righttouse assets classification of a lease does not change if it is part of a business combination in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we may utilize a number of sources that arise in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data including thirdparty appraisals and valuations in certain situations a deferred tax liability is recognized due to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the acquired assets at the acquisition date any consideration paid in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired would be recorded to goodwill in very limited circumstances we may record a bargain purchase gain if the consideration paid is less than the net fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired  reclassifications  certain prior year financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation  new accounting standards in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 the new standard sets forth steps to determine the timing and amount of revenue to be recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects in exchange in march april may and december 2016 the fasb issued asus nos 201608 201610 201612 and 201620 respectively all related to revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 which further clarify the application of the standard in august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201514 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 deferral of the effective date which deferred the effectiveness of asu no 201409 to reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and permitted early application for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 the new standards can be applied retrospectively or under a modified retrospective approach based on our assessment of this standard it will not materially affect the amount or timing of revenue recognition for revenues from room food and beverage and other hotel level sales however it may allow for earlier gain recognition for certain sale transactions under which we have continuing involvement upon adoption we expect to implement these standards using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect recognized and no prior period restatements  in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases topic 842 which affects aspects of accounting for lease agreements under the new standard all leases including operating leases will require recognition of the lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees on the balance sheet however the effect on the statement of operations and the statement of cash flows largely is unchanged the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 with early application permitted the standard requires a modified retrospective approach with restatement of the periods presented in the year of adoption the primary impact of the new standard will be to the treatment of our 26 ground leases which represent approximately 85 of all of our operating lease payments while we have not completed our analysis we believe that the application of this standard will result in the recording of a right of use asset and the related lease liability of between 400 million and 500 million for the ground leases although changes in discount rates ground lease terms or other variables may have a significant effect on this calculation as noted above we expect that the adoption of this standard will have minimal impact on our income statement in march 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting which is intended to simplify accounting for sharebased payment transactions and will affect the classification of certain sharebased awards and related income tax withholdings the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 with early adoption permitted as a result of the standard we anticipate that the majority of our sharebased payment awards granted in 2017 will be deemed equityclassified awards and the excess tax benefits or deficiencies that are incurred based on the difference between the  111  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements   intrinsic value of the award and the grantdate fair value will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the income statement however we do not anticipate that the implementation of this standard will have a material effect on our financial statements in november 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash which requires that on the statement of cash flows amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending total amounts thereof upon adoption of this standard amounts included in restricted cash and furniture fixtures and equipment replacement fund on our consolidated balance sheet will be included with cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows these amounts totaled 175 million and 156 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the adoption of this standard will not change our balance sheet presentation the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption permitted we plan to adopt this standard beginning january 1 2017 in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201701 business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business the standard adopts a twostep approach wherein if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single group of similar identifiable assets then the transaction would be considered an asset purchase as a result of the standard we anticipate that the majority of our hotel purchases will be considered asset purchases as opposed to business combinations although the determination will be made on a transactionbytransaction basis this standard will be applied on a prospective basis and therefore it does not affect the accounting for any of our previous transactions the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption permitted       2  property and equipment  property and equipment consists of the following in millions              as of december 31             2016        2015       land

therefore no unvested awards were outstanding at december 31 2016  restricted stock awards  vesting of restricted stock awards is based on 1 the achievement of relative total shareholder return tsr

compared to i the nareit index ii the standard amp poors index and iii a selected lodging company index that serves as a relevant industryasset specific measurement to our competitors with the remaining 50 based on the achievement of management business objectives restricted stock awards granted to us senior executives are classified as liability awards due to settlement features that allow the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet income tax requirements in excess of the statutory minimum income tax withholding requirements the fair value of these shares is adjusted at each balance sheet date and at year end is equal to the number of shares earned during the year at the december 31 2016 stock price of the awards granted in 2016 99 were classified as liability awards in contrast restricted stock awards granted to senior executives operating out of our international offices do not have this settlement feature and are considered

operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation as well as termination without sale or other condition which may require the payment of a fee these termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by ebitda require that a certain number of properties continue to maintain the brand affiliation or be restricted to a specific pool of assets      15  geographic and business segment information  we consider each one of our hotels to be an operating segment none of which meets the threshold for a reportable segment we also allocate resources and assess operating performance based on individual hotels all of our other real estate investment activities primarily our retail and office spaces are immaterial and with our operating segments meet the aggregation criteria and thus we report one segment hotel ownership our international operations consist of hotels in four countries as of december 31 2016 there were no intersegment sales during the periods presented the following table presents revenues and longlived

which consist of commitments made to third parties for leases or debt that are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements due to various dispositions spinoffs and contractual arrangements but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including the default by an unrelated party we also may have contingent environmental liabilities related to the presence of hazardous or toxic substances we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees and contingencies to be remote the guarantees and contingencies that are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements are listed below           we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested nonlodging properties these properties primarily represent certain restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately 12 million as of december 31 2016           in connection with the sale of two hotels in january 2005 we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases the future minimum lease payments are approximately 8 million through the full term of the leases including renewal options we believe that the likelihood of any material payments related to these ground leases is remote and in each case we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel in connection with the sale of the atlanta marriott marquis in january 2013 we retained a contingent liability for potential environmental liabilities which is not to exceed 5 million this amount is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet        17  legal proceedings  we are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business regarding the operation of our hotels and company matters to the extent not covered by insurance these lawsuits generally fall into the following broad categories disputes involving hotellevel contracts employment litigation compliance with laws such as the americans with disabilities act tax disputes and other general matters under our management agreements our operators have broad latitude to resolve individual hotellevel claims for amounts generally less than 150000 however for matters exceeding such threshold our operators may not settle claims without our consent  based on our analysis of legal proceedings with which we currently are involved or of which we are aware and our experience in resolving similar claims in the past we have accrued approximately 5 million as of december 31 2016 we have estimated that in the aggregate our losses related to these proceedings could be as much as 17 million we believe this range represents the maximum potential loss for all of our legal proceedings we are not aware of any other matters with a reasonably possible unfavorable outcome for which disclosure of a loss contingency is required no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings        18  quarterly financial data unaudited            2016             first        second        third        fourth             quarter        quarter
