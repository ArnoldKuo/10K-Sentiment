exchange commission and delivered to stockholders in connection with its annual meeting of stockholders to be held on may 14 2015 are incorporated by reference into part iii of this form 10k               explanatory note  this report combines the annual reports on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2014 of host hotels amp resorts inc and host hotels amp resorts lp unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires references to host inc mean host hotels amp resorts inc a maryland corporation and references to host lp mean host hotels amp resorts lp a delaware limited partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries we use the terms we or our or the company to refer to host inc and host lp together unless the context indicates otherwise we use the term host inc to specifically refer to host hotels amp resorts inc and the term host lp to specifically refer to host hotels amp resorts lp and its consolidated subsidiaries in cases where it is important to distinguish between host inc and host lp host inc owns properties and conducts operations through host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99 of the partnership interests op units as of december 31 2014 the remaining partnership interests are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners as the sole general partner of host lp host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lps daytoday management and control  we believe combining the annual reports on form 10k of host inc and host lp into this single report results in the following benefits        enhances investors understanding of host inc and host lp by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business        eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation since a substantial portion of our disclosure applies to both host inc and host lp and        creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports  management operates host inc and host lp as one enterprise the management of host inc consists of the same members who direct the management of host lp the executive officers of host inc are appointed by host incs board of directors but are employed by host lp host lp employs everyone who works for host inc or host lp as general partner with control of host lp host inc consolidates host lp for financial reporting purposes and host inc does not have significant assets other than its investment in host lp therefore the assets and liabilities of host inc and host lp are the same on their respective financial statements  there are a few differences between host inc and host lp which are reflected in the disclosure in this report we believe it is important to understand the differences between host inc and host lp in the context of how host inc and host lp operate as an interrelated consolidated company host inc is a real estate investment trust or reit and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of host lp as a result host inc does not conduct business itself other than acting as the sole general partner of host lp and issuing public equity from time to time the proceeds from which are contributed to host lp in exchange for op units host inc itself does not issue any indebtedness and does not guarantee the debt or obligations of host lp host lp holds substantially all of our assets and holds the ownership interests in our joint ventures host lp conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a limited partnership with no publicly traded equity except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by host inc host lp generates the capital required by our business through host lps operations by host lps direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of op units  the substantive difference between the filings of host inc and host lp is that host inc is a reit with public stock while host lp is a partnership with no publicly traded equity in the financial statements this difference primarily is reflected in the equity or partners capital for host lp section of the consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of equity or partners capital and in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss with respect to the manner in which income is allocated to noncontrolling interests income allocable to the holders of approximately 1 of the op units is reflected as income allocable to noncontrolling interests at host inc and within net income at host lp also earnings per share generally will be slightly less than the earnings per op unit as each host inc common share is the equivalent of 97895 op units instead of 1 op unit apart from these differences the financial statements of host inc and host lp are nearly identical  i    to help investors understand the differences between host inc and host lp this report presents the following separate sections or portions of sections for each of host inc and host lp        part ii item 5

host incs 2014 annual report to stockholders contain some forwardlooking statements that set forth anticipated results based on managements plans and assumptions from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have tried wherever possible to identify each such statement by using words such as anticipate estimate expect project intend plan believe will target forecast and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance in particular these forwardlooking statements include those relating to future actions future acquisitions or dispositions future capital expenditures plans future performance or results of current and anticipated expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates or the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings  we cannot guarantee that any future results discussed in any forwardlooking statements will be realized although we believe that we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions including those discussed in item 1a risk factors should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could differ materially from past results and those results anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements  we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make or related subjects in our reports on form 10q and form 8k that we file with the securities and exchange commission sec also note that in our risk factors we provide a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from past results and those results anticipated estimated or projected we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 it is not possible to predict or identify all such risk factors consequently you should not consider the discussion of risk factors to be a complete discussion of all of the potential risks or uncertainties that could affect our business      item 1  business  host inc was incorporated as a maryland corporation in 1998 and operates as a selfmanaged and selfadministered reit host inc owns properties and conducts operations through host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and in which it holds approximately 99 of the partnership interests op units as of december 31 2014 the remaining partnership interests are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lps daytoday management and control  as of february 20 2015 our consolidated lodging portfolio consists of 114 primarily luxury and upperupscale hotels containing approximately 59000 rooms with the majority located in the united states and with 17 of the properties located outside of the us in australia brazil canada chile mexico and new zealand in addition we own noncontrolling interests in two international joint ventures a joint venture in europe which owns 19 luxury and upper upscale hotels with approximately 6500 rooms in belgium france germany italy poland spain sweden the netherlands and the united kingdom and a joint venture in asiapacific which owns one upscale hotel in australia and minority interests in three operating hotels two upscale and one midscale in india and four additional hotels in india currently under development we also hold noncontrolling investments in two hotels and a timeshare joint venture  business strategy  our goal is to be the premier lodging real estate company and to generate superior total returns for our stockholders through a combination of appreciation in asset values growth in earnings and dividend distributions to achieve this objective we seek to       own a highquality portfolio of hotel real estate primarily located in our target markets       create value in our existing portfolio through wellintegrated asset management and capital investment       allocate and recycle capital with discipline to earn returns that exceed our cost of capital       maintain a flexible capital structure that fosters external growth even through a downturn and       align our organizational structure with our business objectives to be an employer of choice and a responsible corporate citizen 1    portfolio management we will focus on refining our portfolio to include multiple types of hotels but in a defined set of target markets that meet our investment criteria this will provide the opportunity for a more comprehensive understanding of our target markets which we believe will increase the probability of earning premium returns over time        our target markets will be those locations which we believe have strong demand generators that appeal to multiple customer segments achieve premium rates and relatively higher barriers to entry that limit new supply while we continually will evaluate and refine our target market list we generally focus on domestic gateway cities and resort markets including new york washington dc boston florida chicago los angeles san francisco san diego seattle houston and hawaii these target markets historically have outperformed the overall us lodging industry in terms of real revenue per available room revpar growth although there can be no assurances that this outperformance will continue for any number of reasons including changes in travel patterns or supply in those markets we also will continue investing internationally either through direct acquisitions or through joint ventures with strategic partners we believe international expansion provides us the opportunity to earn favorable riskadjusted returns and diversify our portfolio our international target markets include western europe through our european joint venture australia singapore mexico and brazil we believe these markets will continue to see more favorable supplydemand and pricing dynamics in the future the following chart details the longterm performance of our domestic target markets over the past 20 years        establishing a deeper foothold through a concentrated market approach is intended to create efficiencies and increase our knowledge of local market dynamics data and relationships we will continue primarily to own upper upscale and luxury hotels that we believe benefit from multiple segments of demand however we also will broaden the types of assets we consider owning to include urban selectservice hotels and lifestyle or boutique hotels which appeal to the transient customer we believe focusing on several different hotel types within our target markets will provide the opportunity to capitalize on the evolving nature of the hotel customer        we will strive for balanced market exposure our general goal is that 80 to 90 of our portfolio revenues will come from hotels located within our target markets which will allow us the flexibility to make opportunistic investments in alternative locations and to continue to hold certain legacy assets that we expect will perform well over time        through our disciplined approach to acquisitions and new development we seek to achieve unlevered returns that exceed our cost of capital generally we will look to invest capital early in the lodging cycle and benefit from the subsequent industrywide increase in values as we move further into the lodging cycle we will increase our focus on opportunities where we believe we can add value through redevelopment repositioning or new development        we will look to reallocate our portfolio toward target markets through our disposition strategy generally our dispositions will be focused on secondary or tertiary markets additionally we will dispose of properties where we believe the potential for growth is constrained or of properties with significant capital expenditures requirements where we do not believe we would generate a significant return on the investment prior to the sale of assets we will look for opportunities to increase the sales price which may include valueadded capital expenditures projects and ground lease  2         extensions we also will look to take advantage of opportunities to capture attractive pricing for hotels that have management contract flexibility we also may dispose of assets in our target markets through direct sales or through the creation of joint ventures when we have the opportunity to capitalize on value enhancement strategies and apply the proceeds to other business objectives asset management as the owner of a large and diverse portfolio of properties we believe we are in a unique position to work with our managers to drive operating profit through revenue growth strategies and cost control initiatives the size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading brands and operators in the industry allow us to benchmark similar hotels and identify best practices and efficiencies that can improve longterm profitability we also carefully evaluate and monitor our property agreements including our management and franchise agreements in an effort to obtain flexibility and drive overall value ultimately our goal is to differentiate our assets within their competitive market drive operating performance and enhance the value of the real estate       work with leading brands as well as independent operators in the lodging industry and actively seek to diversify within our portfolio we will look to capitalize on situations where we have management agreement flexibility to appropriately match a hotel and its operator brand and contract terms this will include new relationships with independent operators that may be an improved fit for smaller or unbranded products       drive revenue growth by conducting detailed strategic reviews with our managers on market pricing and segment mix to develop the appropriate grouptransient mix and market share targets for each property we also work with our managers to ensure that their brands online presence addresses a broad customer base including group customers and overseas travelers       enhance profitability by using our proprietary business intelligence system to benchmark and monitor hotel performance and cost controls and complete deepdive analytic reviews to identify new opportunities that could increase profit       improve contract flexibility through the extension or purchase of ground leases or the restructuring of management agreements to enhance overall value        strategically position food amp beverage outlets through initiatives such as combining bars and restaurants to create a more relevant experience for consumers throughout the day or outsourcing outlets when a viable partnership may improve profitability and increase our customer base capital investment we focus on creating and mining value from our existing portfolio through capital investments and value enhancement initiatives these projects may include significant changes to rooms public space and meeting space as well as a repositioning of the property under a different operator or brand we work closely with our managers to time these projects so as to attempt to reduce disruption to operations and environmental impacts        value enhancement initiatives seek to achieve the highest and best use of our properties these projects may include the development of timeshare office space or condominium units on excess land redevelopment or expansion of existing retail space and the acquisition of air rights or development entitlements       redevelopment and return on investment projects are designed to take advantage of changing market conditions and the favorable location of our properties and seek to increase profitability and enhance customer satisfaction our capital expenditures projects generally fall into the following categories redevelopment projects these projects are designed to improve the positioning of our hotels within their markets and competitive set redevelopment projects include extensive renovations of guest rooms and bathrooms lobbies food and beverage outlets expanding andor extensive renovation of ballroom and meeting rooms major mechanical system upgrades and green building initiatives and certifications  targeted return on investment roi projects these projects often are smaller and focused on increasing space profitability or lowering net operating costs typical roi projects include converting unprofitable or underutilized space into meeting space adding guestrooms and implementing energy and water conservation measures such as led lighting guestroom water efficient fixtures and building automation systems        acquisition capital expenditures projects are completed in connection with the acquisition of a property for each new acquisition we prepare capital and operational improvement plans designed to improve profitability and enhance the guest experience these projects may include required renewal and replacement projects significant redevelopment and even rebranding of the property and represent a key component of our decision to invest in a hotel these projects typically are completed within two to three years of acquisition  3          renewal and replacement capital expenditures are designed to maintain the quality and competitiveness of our hotel properties typically room renovations occur at intervals of approximately seven years but the timing may vary based on the type of property and equipment being renovated these renovations generally are divided into the following types soft goods case goods bathroom and infrastructure soft goods include items such as carpeting bed spreads curtains and wall vinyl and may require more frequent updates in order to maintain brand quality standards case goods include items such as dressers desks couches restaurant and meeting room chairs and tables which generally are not replaced as frequently bathroom renovations include the replacement of tile vanity lighting and plumbing fixtures infrastructure includes the physical plant of the hotel including the roof elevatorsescalators façade heating ventilation and air conditioning systems and fire systems  financing strategy in order to maintain its qualification as a reit host inc is required to distribute 90 of its taxable income other than net capital gain but including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash to its stockholders and as a result generally relies on external sources of capital as well as cash from operations to finance growth we use a variety of debt and equity instruments to fund our external growth including senior notes and mortgage debt exchangeable debentures common and preferred stock offerings issuances of op units and joint ventureslimited partnerships to take advantage of the prevailing market conditions        management believes that a strong balance sheet is a key competitive advantage that affords us a lower cost of capital and positions us for external growth while we may issue debt at any time generally we will target a net debttoebitda ratio or leverage ratio as defined in our credit facility of 25x to 30x and to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt we believe the investment grade rating and lower leverage will deliver the most consistent access to capital thereby providing us with the necessary flexibility to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging cycle        we seek to structure our debt profile to allow us to access different forms of financing primarily senior notes and exchangeable debentures as well as mortgage debt particularly outside of the us when debt is priced reasonably and can be denominated in the local currency generally this means we look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt minimize nearterm maturities and maintain a balanced maturity schedule we may seek to issue debt in foreign currencies to match the proceeds with their intended use in order to reduce the potential costs of international investing related to currency fluctuation and local taxes depending on market conditions we also may utilize variable rate debt which can provide greater protection during a decline in the lodging industry generally we will target our floating rate debt to be 20 to 35 of total debt in part depending on our outlook on future interest rates       we expect to continue to utilize joint ventures to finance external growth we believe joint ventures provide a significant means to access external capital and spread the inherent risk of hotel ownership our primary focus for joint ventures is in international markets which helps to diversify exposure to market risk  corporate responsibility our corporate responsibility program is managed by our corporate responsibility team led by our executive vice president human resources and managing director global development design and construction and overseen by our ceo and the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors our corporate responsibility program focuses on the management of the environmental social and governance risks and opportunities for our business and is organized around the following themes and objectives        responsible investment we incorporate sustainability into our asset management approach during the acquisition of new properties we assess both sustainability opportunities and climate change related risks as part of our due diligence process during the ownership of our properties we seek to invest in proven sustainability practices in our redevelopment and roi projects that can enhance asset value while also improving environmental performance        environmental stewardship we seek to improve the environmental footprint of our properties we have established goals to reduce energy use and carbon emissions from 2008 levels by 12 percent and water use by 15 percent by 2017 across our portfolio as part of our asset management approach we work closely with our hotel managers to monitor environmental performance and support implementation of operational best practices in our redevelopment and roi projects we target specific environmental efficiency projects equipment upgrades and replacements that reduce energy and water consumption and offer appropriate returns on investment       corporate citizenship we are committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and strengthening our local communities we do this through financial support community engagement volunteer service and industry collaboration our approach to corporate citizenship is reinforced by our code of business conduct and ethics and periodic engagement with key stakeholders to understand their corporate responsibility priorities   4     the lodging industry  the lodging industry in the united states consists of private and public entities that operate in an extremely diversified market under a variety of brand names the lodging industry has several key participants        ownersown the hotel and typically enter into an agreement for an independent third party to manage the hotel these properties may be branded and operated under the managers brand or branded under a franchise agreement and operated by the franchisee or by an independent hotel manager the properties also may be operated as an independent hotel by an independent hotel manager        ownermanagersown the hotel and operate the property with their own management team these properties may be branded under a franchise agreement operated as an independent hotel or operated under the owners brand we are prohibited from operating and managing hotels under applicable reit rules        franchisorsown a brand or brands and strive to grow their revenues by expanding the number of hotels in their franchise system franchisors provide their hotels with brand recognition marketing support and centralized reservation systems for the franchised hotels        franchisormanagersown a brand or brands and also operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner or franchisee        managersoperate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner but do not themselves own a brand the hotels may be operated under a franchise agreement or as an independent hotel  the hotel manager is responsible for the daytoday operation of the hotel including the employment of hotel staff the determination of room rates the development of sales and marketing plans the preparation of operating and capital expenditures budgets and the preparation of financial reports for the owner the hotel manager typically receives fees based on the revenues and profitability of the hotel  supply and demand trends our industry is influenced by the cyclical relationship between the supply of and demand for hotel rooms lodging demand growth typically is related to the vitality of the overall economy in addition to local market factors that stimulate travel to specific destinations in particular trends in economic indicators such as gdp growth business investment and employment growth are key indicators of the relative strength of lodging demand  lodging supply growth generally is driven by overall lodging demand as extended periods of strong demand growth tend to encourage new development however the rate of supply growth also is influenced by a number of additional factors including the availability of capital interest rates construction costs and unique market considerations the relatively long leadtime required to complete the development of hotels makes supply growth easier to forecast than demand growth but increases the volatility of the cyclical behavior of the lodging industry as illustrated in the charts below for the us lodging industry at different points in the cycle demand may increase when there is no new supply or supply may grow when demand is declining  5    our portfolio primarily consists of upper upscale hotels and accordingly its performance is best understood in comparison to the upper upscale segment rather than the entire industry the charts below detail the historical supply demand and revpar growth for the us lodging industry and for the us upper upscale segment for 2010 to 2014 and forecast data for 2015  us lodging industry supply demand and revpar growth    us upper upscale supply demand and revpar growth       6    managers and operational agreements all of our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements with some of such hotels also subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operation under the designated brand under these agreements the managers generally have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the daytoday operation of the hotels including establishing room rates securing and processing reservations procuring inventories supplies and services providing periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers technical and operational experts and promoting and publicizing the hotels the managers provide all managerial and other employees for the hotels review the operation and maintenance of the hotels prepare reports budgets and projections and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels these support services include planning and policy services divisional financial services product planning and development employee staffing and training corporate executive management and certain inhouse legal services we have certain approval rights over budgets capital expenditures significant leases and contractual commitments and various other matters  these management agreements can affect the value of the property associated with it based on the pricing and flexibility of the agreement in addition to customary performance termination rights certain of our agreements with starwood and marriott have limited special termination rights as detailed below that can lend to the flexibility of the agreement we often will seek to negotiate the terms of an agreement to provide greater value to the associated asset see termination rights and special termination rights described below general terms and provisions  agreements governing the management and operation of our hotels typically include the terms described below        term and fees for operational services the initial term of our management and operating agreements generally is 15 to 25 years with one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager the majority of our management agreements condition the managers right to exercise options for specified renewal terms upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria the manager typically receives compensation in the form of a base management fee which is calculated as a percentage generally 23 of annual gross revenues and an incentive management fee which typically is calculated as a percentage generally 1020 of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the hotel in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the base management fee is only 1 of annual gross revenues but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable to starwood under a separate license agreement as described below        license services in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the operation of the hotels is governed by separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to the designated brand including rights to use trademarks service marks and logos matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services although the term of these license agreements with starwood generally is coterminous with the corresponding operating agreements the license agreements contemplate the potential for continued brand affiliation even in the event of a termination of the operating agreement as noted above the starwood licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees generally 5 of gross revenues attributable to room sales and 2 of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales which amounts supplement the lower base management fee of 1 of gross revenues received by starwood under the operating agreements        chain or system programs and services managers are required to provide chain or system programs and services generally that are furnished on a centralized basis such services include the development and operation of certain computer systems and reservation services regional or other centralized management and administrative services marketing and sales programs and services training and other personnel services and other centralized or regional services as may be determined to be more efficiently performed on a centralized regional or group basis rather than on an individual hotel basis costs and expenses incurred in providing these chain or system programs and services generally are allocated on a cost reimbursement basis among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates or that otherwise benefit from these services        working capital and fixed asset supplies we are required to maintain working capital for each hotel and to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies for example linen china glassware silver and uniforms we also are responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds available from working capital are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels for certain hotels the working capital accounts which would otherwise be maintained by the managers for each of such hotels are maintained on a pooled basis with managers being authorized to make withdrawals from such pooled account as otherwise contemplated with respect to working capital in accordance with the provisions of the management or operating agreements        furniture fixtures and equipment replacements we are required to provide the managers with all furniture fixtures and equipment ffampe necessary for the operation of the hotels including funding any required ffampe replacements on an annual basis the managers prepare budgets for ffampe to be acquired and certain routine repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the necessary funds which budgets are subject to our review and approval for purposes of funding such expenditures a specified percentage typically 5 of the gross revenues of each hotel is deposited by the manager into an escrow or reserve account in our name to which the manager has access in the case of  7         our starwoodmanaged hotels our operating agreements contemplate that this reserve account also may be used to fund the cost of certain major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building as described below for certain of our marriottmanaged hotels we have entered into an agreement with marriott to allow for such expenditures to be funded from one pooled reserve account rather than funds being deposited into separate reserve accounts at each hotel with the minimum required balance maintained on an ongoing basis in that pooled reserve account being significantly below the amount that would have been maintained otherwise in such separate hotel reserve accounts for certain of our starwoodmanaged hotels the periodic reserve fund contributions which otherwise would be deposited into reserve accounts maintained by managers for each hotel are distributed to us and as to this pool of hotels we are responsible for providing funding of expenditures which otherwise would be funded from reserve accounts for each of the subject hotels        building alterations improvements and renewals the managers are required to prepare an annual estimate of the expenditures necessary for major repairs alterations improvements renewals and replacements to the structural mechanical electrical heating ventilating air conditioning plumbing and elevators of each hotel along with alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required in the managers reasonable judgment to keep the hotel in a competitive efficient and economical operating condition that is consistent with brand standards we generally have approval rights as to such budgets and expenditures which we review and approve based on our managers recommendations and on our judgment expenditures for these major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building typically are funded directly by owners although as noted above our agreements with starwood contemplate that certain such expenditures may be funded from the reserve account        treatment of additional owner funding as additional owner funding becomes necessary either for expenditures generally funded from the ffampe replacement funds or for any major repairs or improvements to the hotel building which may be required to be funded directly by owners most of our agreements provide for an economic benefit to us through an impact on the calculation of incentive management fees payable to our managers one approach frequently utilized at our marriottmanaged hotels is to provide such owner funding through loans which are repaid with interest from operational revenues with the repayment amounts reducing operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees another approach that is used at our starwoodmanaged hotels as well as with certain capital expenditures projects at our marriottmanaged hotels is to treat such owner funding as an increase to our investment in the hotel resulting in an increase to owners priority return with a corresponding reduction to the amount of operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees for our starwoodmanaged hotels that are subject to the pooled arrangement described above the amount of any additional reserve account funding is allocated to each of such hotels on a pro rata basis determined with reference to the net operating income of each hotel and the total net operating income of all such pooled hotels for the most recent operating year        territorial protections certain management and operating agreements impose restrictions for a specified period which limit the manager and its affiliates from owning operating or licensing a hotel of the same brand within a specified area the area restrictions vary with each hotel from city blocks in urban areas to up to a multimile radius from the hotel in other areas        sale of the hotel subject to specific agreements as to certain hotels see below under special termination rights we generally are limited in our ability to sell lease or otherwise transfer the hotels by the requirement that the transferee assume the related management agreements and meet specified other conditions including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the manager        performance termination rights in addition to any right to terminate that may arise as a result of a default by the manager most of our management and operating agreements include reserved rights by us to terminate management or operating agreements on the basis of the managers failure to meet certain performancebased metrics typically including a specified threshold return on owners investment in the hotel along with a failure of the hotel to achieve a specified revpar performance threshold established with reference to other competitive hotels in the market typically such performancebased termination rights arise in the event the operator fails to achieve specified performance thresholds over a consecutive twoyear period and are subject to the managers ability to cure and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts or in some instances waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees we have agreed in the past and may agree in the future to waive certain of these termination rights in exchange for consideration from a manager or its affiliates which consideration may include cash compensation or amendments to management agreements        special termination rights in addition to any performancebased or other termination rights set forth in our management and operating agreements we have specific negotiated termination rights as to certain management and operating agreements with respect to our marriott portfolio subject to certain timing and other limitations these rights include termination rights applicable to 15 properties with respect to our starwood portfolio subject to certain timing and other limitations these rights include termination rights applicable to 10 properties we also have similar termination rights applicable to 8 other properties while the brand affiliation of a property may increase the value of a hotel the ability to dispose of a property unencumbered by a management agreement or even brand affiliation also can increase the value for  8         prospective purchasers these termination rights can take a number of different forms including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation as well as termination without sale or other condition which may require the payment of a fee these termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by ebitda require that a certain number of properties continue to maintain the brand affiliation or be restricted to a specific pool of assets  operating structure  host inc operates through an umbrella partnership structure in which substantially all of its assets are held by host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and holds approximately 99 of the op units as of december 31 2014 a reit is a corporation that has elected to be treated as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code and that meets certain ownership organizational and operating requirements set forth under the code in general through payments of dividends to stockholders a reit is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level each op unit owned by holders other than host inc is redeemable at the option of the holder for an amount of cash equal to the market value of one share of host inc common stock multiplied by the current conversion factor of 1021494 host inc has the right to acquire any op unit offered for redemption directly from the holder in exchange for 1021494 shares of host inc common stock instead of host lp redeeming such op unit for cash additionally for every share of common stock issued by host inc host lp will issue 97895 op units to host inc in exchange for the consideration received from the issuance of the common stock as of december 31 2014 noncontrolling limited partners held 93 million op units which were convertible into 94 million host inc common shares assuming that all op units held by noncontrolling limited partners were converted into common shares there would have been 7652 million common shares of host inc outstanding at december 31 2014  our operating structure is as follows     because host inc has elected to be treated as a reit certain tax laws limit the amount of nonqualifying income that host inc and host lp can earn including income derived directly from the operation of hotels as a result we lease substantially all of our consolidated properties to certain of our subsidiaries designated as taxable reit subsidiaries trs for federal income tax purposes or to third party lessees our trs are subject to income tax and are not limited as to the amount of nonqualifying income they can generate our trs enter into agreements with third parties to manage the operations of the hotels our trs also may own assets engaging in other activities that produce nonqualifying income such as the development of timeshare or condominium units subject to certain restrictions the difference between the hotels net operating cash flow and the aggregate rents paid to host lp is retained by our trs as taxable income accordingly the net effect of the trs leases is that while as a reit host inc generally does not pay federal and state income tax to the extent that it meets specific distribution requirements among other reit requirements a portion of the net operating cash flow from our properties is subject to federal state and if applicable foreign income tax  9    our consolidated hotel portfolio  as of february 20 2015 we owned a portfolio of 114 hotel properties of which 97 are located in the united states and 17 are located in australia brazil canada chile mexico and new zealand our consolidated hotels located outside the united states collectively contain approximately 4200 rooms approximately 5 of our revenues were attributed to the operations of these foreign properties in each of 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different segments each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs luxury upper upscale upscale midscale with and without food and beverage service and economy our portfolio primarily consists of luxury and upper upscale properties that are located in the central business districts of major cities near airports and resortconference destinations which are operated under internationally recognized brand names such as marriott hyatt starwood and accor there also has been a trend towards more specialized smaller boutique hotels that are customized towards a particular customer profile generally these properties will be operated by an independent third party and either will have no brand affiliation or will be associated with a major brand while maintaining the majority of its independent identity which we refer to as softbranded properties we have expanded our investments to include independent and softbranded properties where we believe that the manager and independent identity is the best fit for the hotel  revenues earned at our hotels consist of three broad categories rooms food and beverage and other revenues while approximately 65 of our revenue is generated from room sales many of our properties feature a variety of amenities that help drive demand and profitability our hotels typically include meeting and banquet facilities a variety of restaurants and lounges swimming pools exercise facilities andor spas gift shops and parking facilities the combination of which enable them to serve business leisure and group travelers  thirtynine of our consolidated hotels representing approximately 62 of our revenues have in excess of 500 rooms the average age of our properties is 32 years although substantially all of the properties have benefited from significant renovations or major additions as well as regularly scheduled renewal and replacement and other capital improvements  by brand the following table details our consolidated hotel portfolio by brand as of february 20

in the property 14    competition  the lodging industry is highly competitive competition often is specific to individual markets and is based on a number of factors including location brand guest facilities and amenities level of service room rates and the quality of accommodations the lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different segments each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs luxury upper upscale upscale midscale with and without food and beverage service and economy the classification of a property is based on lodging industry standards which take into consideration many factors such as guest facilities and amenities level of service and quality of accommodations most of our hotels operate in urban and resort markets either as luxury properties under such brand names as fairmont grand hyatt jw marriott ritzcarlton st regis the luxury collection and w or as upper upscale properties under such brand names as embassy suites hilton hyatt le méridien marriott executive apartments marriott marquis marriott suites pullman renaissance sheraton swissôtel and westin we also may selectively invest in upscale and midscale properties such as courtyard by marriott crowne plaza four points by sheraton hyatt place ibis novotel or residence inn by marriott particularly in international markets 11 while our hotels primarily compete with other hotels in the luxury and upper upscale segments they also may compete with hotels in other lowertier segments in addition many management contracts for our hotels do not prohibit our managers from converting franchising or developing other hotel properties in our markets as a result our hotels compete with other hotels that our managers may own invest in manage or franchise  we believe our properties enjoy competitive advantages associated with the hotel brands under which they operate the international marketing programs and reservation systems of these brands combined with the strong management systems and expertise they provide should enable our properties to perform favorably in terms of both occupancy and room rates in addition repeat guest business is enhanced by guest reward or guest recognition programs offered by most of these brands we also compete with other reits and other public and private investors for the acquisition of new properties and investment opportunities both in domestic and international markets as we attempt to position our portfolio to take best advantage of changes in markets and travel patterns of our customers  seasonality  our hotel sales traditionally have experienced moderate seasonality which varies based on the individual property and the region hotel sales for our consolidated portfolio averaged approximately 24 27 24 and 25 for the first second third and fourth calendar quarters respectively in 2014  environmental and regulatory matters  under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances these laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances in addition certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of hazardous or toxic materials and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released hazardous or toxic materials environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated and these restrictions may require corrective or other expenditures in connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels we potentially may be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities although currently we are not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us we can offer no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future  employees  as of february 20 2015 we had 251 employees of which 228 work in the united states we had 23 employees located in our offices in london amsterdam and singapore none of hosts employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements the number of employees referenced above does not include the hotel employees of our 11 hotels in brazil new zealand and australia which while technically are host employees are under the direct supervision and control of our thirdparty hotel managers our thirdparty managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels although we do not manage employees at our consolidated hotels we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force particularly those hotels with unionized labor we believe relations with the employees of these third party managers are positive for a discussion of these relationships see part i item 1a risk factorswe are subject to risks

our website is not incorporated by reference in or considered to be a part of any document unless expressly incorporated by reference therein       item 1a  risk factors  the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995  financial risks and risks of operation  our revenues and the value of our properties are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry  the performance of the lodging industry traditionally has been affected by the strength of the general economy and specifically growth in gross domestic product gdp changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers particularly during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth may create difficulties for the industry over the longterm and adversely affect our results of operations the majority of our hotels are classified as luxury or upper upscale and generally target business and highend leisure travelers in periods of economic difficulties business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel or seeking to reduce costs on their trips consequently our luxury or upper upscale hotels may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenue during an economic downturn as compared to hotels in other categories that have lower room rates for instance reductions in overall travel during the recession in 2008 and 2009 significantly affected our results of operations other circumstances affecting the lodging industry which may affect our performance and the forecasts we make include       changes in the international national regional and local economic climate       the effect of terrorist attacks and terror alerts in the united states and internationally as well as other geopolitical disturbances       supply growth in markets where we own hotels which may adversely affect demand at our properties        the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers relative to competing hotels       the performance of the managers of our hotels       outbreaks of disease and the impact on travel of natural disasters and weather       physical damage to our hotels as a result of earthquakes hurricanes or other natural disasters or the income lost as a result of the damage 16          changes in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors       unionization of the labor force at our hotels and       political uncertainty and changes in government policies in particular with respect to us economic policy us federal budget deficit concerns or a reduction in travel by us government employees and contractors as a result of spending cuts we cannot assure you that adverse changes in the general economy or other circumstances that affect the lodging industry will not have an adverse effect on the hotel revenue or earnings at our properties a reduction in our revenue or earnings as a result of the above risks may reduce our working capital and revenue impact our longterm business strategy and impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet certain covenants in our existing debt agreements in addition we may incur impairment charges in the future which charges will affect negatively our results of operations we can provide no assurance that any impairment loss recognized would not be material to our results of operations we depend on external sources of capital for future growth therefore any disruption to our ability to access capital at times and on terms reasonably acceptable to us may affect adversely our business and results of operations  unlike regular c corporations host inc must finance its growth and fund debt repayments largely with external sources of capital because it is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of its taxable income other than net capital gain in order to qualify as a reit including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which it does not receive cash funds used by host inc to make required distributions are provided by distributions from host lp our ability to access external capital could be hampered by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control including       price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the us and global equity and credit markets such as occurred during 2008 and 2009       changes in market perception of our growth potential including rating agency downgrades by moodys investors service standard amp poors ratings services or fitch ratings       decreases in our current and estimated future earnings       decreases or fluctuations in the market price of the common stock of host inc        increases in interest rates and       the terms of our existing indebtedness which under certain circumstances restrict our incurrence of debt the occurrence of any of these factors individually or in combination could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our future growth and our results of operations and financial condition potential consequences of disruptions in us and global equity and credit markets and as a result an inability for us to access external capital at times and on terms reasonably acceptable to us could include       a need to seek alternative sources of capital with less attractive terms such as more restrictive covenants and shorter maturity       adverse effects on our financial condition and liquidity and our ability to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital debt service and capital expenditures       higher costs of capital        an inability to enter into derivative contracts in order to hedge risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates or        an inability to execute on our acquisition strategy we have substantial debt and may incur additional debt  as of december 31 2014 we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately 40 billion our substantial indebtedness requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our annual cash flow from operations to debt service payments which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures expansion efforts dividends and distributions and other general corporate needs additionally our substantial indebtedness could        make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness        limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or to obtain financing for expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate needs on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all or  17          affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions  if our cash flow and working capital are not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness we will be required to raise additional funds through        sales of host lps op units or host incs common stock        the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by host lp or        the sale of our assets  we cannot make any assurances that any of these sources of funds will be available to us or if available will be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient to meet our obligations or fulfill our business plan under certain circumstances we would be required to use the cash from some of the events described above to repay other indebtedness  the terms of our indebtedness and preferred units place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and these restrictions reduce our operational flexibility and create default risks  we are and may in the future become party to agreements and instruments that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries for instance the covenants in the documents governing the terms of our senior notes and our credit facility restrict among other things our ability to       conduct acquisitions mergers or consolidations unless the successor entity in such transaction assumes our indebtedness       incur additional debt in excess of certain thresholds and without satisfying certain financial metrics       incur liens securing indebtedness unless an effective provision is made to secure our other indebtedness by such liens       sell assets without using the proceeds from such sales for certain permitted uses or to make an offer to repay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness       pay dividends on classes and series of host inc capital stock and pay distributions on host lps classes of units without satisfying certain financial metrics concerning leverage fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage and       conduct transactions with affiliates other than on an arms length basis and in certain instances without obtaining opinions as to the fairness of such transactions in addition certain covenants in our credit facility also require us and our subsidiaries to meet financial metrics the restrictive covenants in the applicable indentures the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt including our mortgage debt will reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt in addition certain of our mortgage debt requires that to the extent cash flow from the hotels which secure such debt drops below stated levels we escrow cash flow after the payment of debt service until operations improve above the stated levels in some cases the lender may apply the escrowed amount to the outstanding balance of the mortgage debt if such provisions are triggered the amounts required to be escrowed may affect negatively our liquidity from these mortgaged properties by limiting our access to cash flow after debt service for a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsfinancial condition an increase in interest rates would increase the interest costs on our credit facility and on our floating rate debt and could impact adversely our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets  interest payments for borrowings on our credit facility the mortgages on certain properties and fixedtofloating interest rate swaps linked to two other properties are based on floating rates as a result an increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes including investments in our portfolio rising interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures and increase interest costs on any debt that is refinanced we may from time to time enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps caps floors and other interest rate hedging contracts currently the majority of our mortgages with floating rates are fully or partially hedged through the use of floatingtofixed interest rate swaps or interest rate caps and floors while these agreements may lessen the impact of rising interest rates they also expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to dispose of assets as part of our business strategy  18    our expenses may not decrease if our revenue decreases  many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels such as debtservice payments property taxes insurance utilities and employee wages and benefits are relatively inflexible they do not necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in revenue at the hotels and may be subject to increases that are not tied to the performance of our hotels or the increase in the rate of inflation generally also as of december 31 2014 35 of our hotels are subject to thirdparty ground leases which generally require periodic increases in ground rent payments our ability to pay these rents could be affected adversely if our hotel revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases  additionally certain costs such as wages benefits and insurance may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period in the event of a significant decrease in demand our hotel managers may not be able to reduce the size of hotel work forces in order to decrease wages and benefits our managers also may be unable to offset any fixed or increased expenses with higher room rates any of our efforts to reduce operating costs also could adversely affect the future growth of our business and the value of our hotel properties our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations  as part of our business strategy we seek to acquire primarily luxury and upper upscale hotel properties we may acquire properties through various structures including transactions involving portfolios single assets joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits or similar real estate entities we anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods and a variety of sources of external capital including proceeds from host inc equity offerings issuance of limited partnership interests of host lp advances under our credit facility the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness and proceeds from the sales of assets our inability to access external sources of capital may limit our ability to finance acquisitions for a discussion of factors that may limit our access to sources of capital see we depend on external sources of capital for future growth therefore any disruption to our ability to access capital at times and on terms reasonably acceptable to us may affect adversely our business and results of operations in addition certain of these factors such as disruption in the global capital markets may limit the ability of purchasers to finance their acquisition of our hotels and therefore our ability to use disposition proceeds to finance our acquisitions we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations these adverse effects may occur because the performance of the property does not justify the additional indebtedness and related interest expense that we incurred as a result of the acquisition in addition assets and entities that we have acquired or may in the future acquire may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse or only limited recourse against the sellers in general the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements may not survive long enough for us to become aware of such liabilities and seek recourse against our sellers and indemnification covering representations and warranties often is limited and subject to various materiality thresholds a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses as a result there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with acquired hotels and entities may exceed our expectations plus we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects all of which may affect adversely our revenues expenses operating results and financial condition finally indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the assets and entities acquired by us while the sellers generally are contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities without regard to survival limitations materiality thresholds deductibles or caps on losses there can be no guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses in addition to those incurred by the sellers we may not achieve the value we anticipate from new hotel developments or value enhancement projects at our existing hotels we currently are and in the future may be involved in the development of hotel properties timeshare units or other alternate uses of portions of our existing properties including the development of retail office or apartments including through joint ventures there are risks inherent in any new development including       we may not obtain the zoning occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations necessary to complete the development a delay in receiving these approvals could affect adversely the returns we expect to receive        any new construction involves the possibility of construction delays and cost overruns that may increase project costs       defects in design or construction may result in delays and additional costs to remedy the defect or require a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the defect 19          we may not be able to meet the loan covenants in any financing obtained to fund the new development creating default risks        the development of timeshare units could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for residential fractional or interval ownership increases in mortgage rates andor decreases in mortgage availability market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell the timeshares for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate  in addition to the extent that developments are conducted through joint ventures this creates additional risks including the possibility that our partners may not meet their financial obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours see we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts  any of the above factors could affect adversely our and our partners ability to complete the developments on schedule and along the scope that currently is contemplated or to achieve the intended value of these projects for these reasons there can be no assurances as to the value to be realized by the company from these transactions or any future similar transactions we do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels  to maintain our status as a reit we are not permitted to operate any of our hotels as a result we have entered into management agreements with thirdparty managers to operate our hotel properties for this reason we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of our hotels such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates food and beverage pricing and certain similar matters although we consult with our hotel operators with respect to strategic business plans the hotel operators are under no obligation to implement any of our recommendations with respect to these matters while we monitor the hotel managers performance we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately the cash flow from our hotels may be affected adversely if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name because our management agreements are longterm agreements we also may not be able to terminate these agreements if we believe the manager is not performing adequately  from time to time we have had and continue to have differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements we generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations however if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to thirdparty dispute resolution failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements or the failure of our managers to adequately manage the risks associated with hotel operations could affect adversely our results of operations  in addition our hotel managers or their affiliates manage and in some cases own have invested in or provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete with our hotels all of which may result in conflicts of interest as a result our hotel managers have in the past made and may in the future make decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest  furthermore our management agreements generally have provisions that can restrict our ability to sell lease or otherwise transfer our hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions our ability to finance or sell our properties depending upon the structure of such transactions may require the managers consent similarly decisions with respect to a repositioning of a hotel such as the outsourcing of food and beverage outlets may require the managers consent  we are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor  our thirdparty managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our consolidated hotels other than employing but not managing or supervising the associates at our properties in brazil new zealand and australia we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force particularly at those hotels with unionized labor from time to time hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes lockouts public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity we also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes involving our thirdparty managers and their labor force or other events the resolution of labor disputes or renegotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs a significant component of our hotel operating costs either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs as we are not the employer nor bound by any collective bargaining agreement we do not negotiate with any labor organization and it is the responsibility of each propertys manager to enter into such labor contracts our ability if any to have any material impact on the  20    outcome of these negotiations is restricted by and dependent on the individual management agreement covering a specific property and we may have little ability to control the outcome of these negotiations our hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive in the marketplace maintain brand standards or to comply with applicable laws or regulations the timing and costs of such renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments  we are required by our loan agreements or agreements with our hotel managers to make agreed upon capital expenditures in addition we will need to make further capital expenditures in order to remain competitive with other hotels to maintain the economic value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations the timing of these improvements can affect hotel performance particularly if the improvements require closure of a significant number of rooms or other features of the hotels such as ballrooms meeting space and restaurants these capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost overruns and delays in addition because we depend on external sources of capital we may not have the necessary funds to invest and if we fail to maintain our properties in accordance with brand standards set by our managers the manager may terminate the management agreement moreover we may not necessarily realize a significant or any improvement in the performance of the hotels in which we make these investments  our hotels are geographically concentrated in a limited number of large urban gateway cities and accordingly we could be disproportionately harmed by adverse changes to these markets a natural disaster or threat of a terrorist attack  the concentration of our hotels in a limited number of large urban gateway cities exposes us to greater risk to local economic or business conditions changes in hotel supply in these cities and other conditions than more geographically diversified hotel companies hotels in new york washington dc san diego san francisco boston florida hawaii atlanta and los angeles represented approximately 71 of our 2014 revenues an economic downturn an increase in hotel supply in these cities a natural disaster a terrorist attack or similar disaster in any one of these cities likely would cause a decline in the hotel market and adversely affect occupancy rates the financial performance of our hotels in these cities and our overall results of operations for example in october 2012 our operations in new york city and other east coast properties were impacted negatively by hurricane sandy in 2013 decreased us government demand for hotel rooms approximately 5 of our business in markets such as washington dc had a negative impact on our results of operations for the year in addition certain of our hotels are located in markets that are more susceptible to natural disasters than others which could adversely affect those hotels the local economies or both for instance our hotels in florida may be susceptible to hurricanes while our hotels in california may be susceptible to earthquakes  the threat of terrorism also may negatively impact hotel occupancy and average daily rate due to resulting disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and concerns about travel safety hotels in major metropolitan areas such as the gateway cities that represent our target markets may be particularly adversely affected due to concerns about travel safety the possibility of future attacks may hamper business and leisure travel patterns and accordingly the performance of our business and our operations  the ownership of hotels outside the united states and the expansion of our business into new markets outside of the united states will expose us to risks related to owning hotels in those international markets  part of our business strategy is to expand our presence outside of the united states as of december 31 2014 we own directly 17 hotels located outside of the united states we also are party to a joint venture that owns 19 hotels in europe and to a joint venture that owns one hotel in australia and a noncontrolling interest in three hotels currently open and four hotels in development in india we may have difficulty managing our expansion into new geographic markets where we have limited knowledge and understanding of the local economy an absence of business relationships in the area or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures and regulations there are risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states which include        risks of noncompliance with varied and unfamiliar employment laws and practices        tax laws which may provide for income or other taxes or tax rates that exceed those of the us and which may provide that foreign earnings that are repatriated directly or indirectly are subject to dividend withholding tax requirements or other restrictions and which may affect our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a tax efficient manner        compliance with and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy        the willingness of domestic or international lenders to provide financing and changes in the availability cost and terms of such financing        adverse changes in local political economic and market conditions  21          insurance coverage related to terrorist events        changes in interest rates andor currency exchange rates and difficulties in hedging these risks        regulations regarding the incurrence of debt       difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries and        difficulties in complying with us rules governing reits while operating outside of the united states  any of these factors could affect adversely our ability to obtain all of the intended benefits of our international expansion if we do not effectively manage this expansion and successfully integrate the international hotels into our organization our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected  we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts  we have made investments in joint ventures and are exploring further investment opportunities in the united states asia europe and latin america we may from time to time invest as a coventurer in other entities holding hotel properties instead of purchasing hotel properties directly we also may sell interests in existing properties to a third party as part of forming a joint venture with such third party investments in joint ventures may involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions coventurers often share control over the operation of a joint venture actions by a coventurer also could subject the assets to additional risks as a result of any of the following circumstances        our coventurer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our or the joint ventures interests or goals or        our coventurer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives  although generally we will seek to maintain sufficient control of any joint venture in order to permit our objectives to be achieved we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and may negatively impact operations  we may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance program for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts and neither u s nor foreign terrorism insurance laws or regulations ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future  we generally obtain terrorism insurance to cover property damage caused by acts of terrorism under separate standalone policies of insurance as well as policies on us properties which currently are subject to us federal government cost sharing as provided in the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act tripra on january 12 2015 president obama signed into law hr 26 which extended tripra through december 31 2020 we also have terrorism insurance under our general liability program and in our program for directors and officers coverage we also obtain terrorism insurance to cover some of our foreign properties through insurance programs involving or administered by foreign governments we may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance policies for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts and neither us nor foreign terrorism insurance legislation or regulations ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future  while tripra allows direct insurers to be reimbursed for certain losses they incur on us properties resulting from nuclear biological chemical and radiological nbcr perils tripra does not require insurers to offer coverage for these perils and to date insurers are not willing to provide this coverage even with government reimbursement any damage related to war and to nbcr incidents therefore is excluded under policies covering our us properties moreover many of our foreign properties are not covered against nbcr perils we obtain a certain amount of property insurance coverage on our us properties for nbcr perils through our whollyowned subsidiary that acts as our direct insurer against such perils to the extent of reimbursement under tripra we ultimately are responsible for any loss borne by our insurance subsidiary  as a result of the above there remains uncertainty regarding the adequacy and cost of terrorism coverage that will be available to protect our interests in the event of terrorist attacks that impact our properties  22    some potential losses are not covered by insurance  we or our hotel managers carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability property business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties these policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar types of properties generally our allrisk property policies provide coverage that is available on a peroccurrence basis and that for each occurrence has an overall limit as well as various sublimits on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive sublimits exist for certain types of claims such as service interruption debris removal expediting costs landscaping replacement and natural disasters such as earthquakes floods and hurricanes and may be subject to annual aggregate coverage limits the dollar amounts of these sublimits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit in this regard hotels in certain of our markets including california florida and new zealand have in the past been and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters recovery under the applicable policies also is subject to substantial deductibles and complex calculations of lost business income there is no assurance that this insurance where maintained will fully fund the rebuilding or restoration of a hotel that is impacted by an earthquake hurricane or other natural disaster or the income lost as a result of the damage our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined together for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sublimits contained in our policies have been exceeded and in the case where the manager of one of our hotels provides this coverage any such claims will be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the managers program for the same purpose therefore if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels or in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by the manager affects hotels owned by others the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sublimits depending on the type of claim have been reached each affected hotel only may receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available we may incur losses in excess of insured limits and as a result we may be even less likely to receive complete coverage for risks that affect multiple properties such as earthquakes hurricanes or certain types of terrorism  in addition there are other risks such as certain environmental hazards that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify coverage we also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier we could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel in that event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property  cyber threats and the risk of data breaches or disruptions of our managers or our own information technology systems could materially adversely affect our business our third party hotel managers are dependent on information technology networks and systems including the internet to access process transmit and store proprietary and customer information these complex networks include reservation systems vacation exchange systems hotel management systems customer databases call centers administrative systems and third party vendor systems these systems require the collection and retention of large volumes of personally identifiable information of hotel guests including credit card numbers our hotel managers may store and process such proprietary and customer information both on systems located at the hotels we own and other hotels operated by our third party managers their corporate locations and at thirdparty owned facilities including for example in a thirdparty hosted cloud environment these information networks and systems can be vulnerable to threats such as system network or internet failures computer hacking or business disruption cyberterrorism viruses worms or other malicious software programs and employee error negligence or fraud the risks from these cyber threats are significant we rely on the security systems of our mangers to protect proprietary and customer information from these threats any compromise of our managers networks could result in a disruption to operations such as disruptions in fulfilling guest reservations delayed bookings or sales or lost guest reservations any of these events could in turn result in disruption of the operations of the hotels we own that our managed by them in increased costs and in potential litigation and liability in addition public disclosure or loss of customer or proprietary information could result in damage to the managers reputation and a loss of confidence among hotel guests and result in reputational harm for the hotels owned by us and managed by them which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  in addition to the information technologies and systems of our managers used to operate our hotels we have our own corporate technologies and systems that are used to access store transmit and manage or support a variety of business processes there can be no assurance that the security measures we have taken to protect the contents of these systems will prevent failures inadequacies or interruptions in system services or that system security will not be breached through physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and attacks by hackers disruptions in service system shutdowns and security breaches in the information technologies and systems we use including unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our business our financial reporting and compliance and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties which could be significant 23    litigation judgments or settlements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition  we are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business and are vigorously defending these claims however no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings we believe based on currently available information that the results of such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but might be material to our operating results for any particular period depending in part upon the operating results for such period we also could become the subject of future claims by the operators of our hotels individuals or companies who use our hotels our investors our joint venture partners or regulating entities and these claims could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and performance  we depend on our key personnel our continued success depends on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key personnel none of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers these individuals are important to our business and strategy and to the extent that any of them departs and is not replaced with a qualified substitute such persons departure could harm our operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations could affect adversely our financial results  as a result of the expansion of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position we generate revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the euro the canadian dollar the mexican peso the australian dollar the new zealand dollar the british pound sterling the polish zloty swedish krona the brazilian real the indian rupee and the chilean peso although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of these and other foreign currencies these transactions if entered into will not eliminate entirely that risk to the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in that same currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate revenues or earnings in other currencies the conversion of such amounts to us dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our revenues or earnings  similarly changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies against the us dollar can result in increases or decreases in demand at our us properties from international travelers coming to the united states because of the concentration of our hotels in us gateway cities we may have more exposure to fluctuations in international travel to the united states than other lodging companies not located as heavily in these markets applicable reit laws may restrict certain business activities  as a reit host inc is subject to various restrictions on the types of income it can earn assets it can own and activities in which it can engage business activities that could be restricted by applicable reit laws include but are not limited to activities such as developing alternative uses of real estate including the development andor sale of timeshare or condominium units due to these restrictions we anticipate that we will conduct certain business activities including those mentioned above in one or more of our taxable reit subsidiaries our taxable reit subsidiaries are taxable as regular c corporations and are subject to federal state local and if applicable foreign taxation on their taxable income  environmental problems are possible and can be costly  we believe that our properties comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws unidentified environmental liabilities could arise however and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance additionally even after we have sold a property we may be liable for environmental liabilities that occurred during our ownership federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property the owner or operator may be required to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site environmental laws also govern the presence maintenance and removal of toxic or hazardous substances these laws require that owners or operators of buildings properly manage and maintain these substances and notify and train those who may come into contact with them and undertake special precautions these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to toxic or hazardous materials  24    compliance with other government regulations can be costly  our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation including title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons these laws and regulations may be changed from timetotime or new regulations adopted resulting in additional costs of compliance including potential litigation for example the ada was revised substantially in september 2010 and our facilities were required to comply with the new regulations by march 15 2012 a determination that we are not in compliance with the ada could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance imposition of civil penalties in cases brought by the justice department or an award of attorneys fees to private litigants compliance with the ada and other laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations  in addition the operations of our international properties are subject to a variety of united states and international laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws but we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international properties might be subject and the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted risks of ownership of host incs common stock  there are limitations on the acquisition of host inc common stock and changes in control  host incs charter and bylaws the partnership agreement of host lp and the maryland general corporation law the mgcl contain a number of provisions the exercise or existence of which could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for host incs stockholders or host lps unitholders or otherwise be in their best interests including the following        restrictions on transfer and ownership of host incs stock to maintain host incs qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of host incs outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned in the last half of the taxable year directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals which as defined in the code may include certain entities in addition if host inc or one or more owners of 10 or more of host inc actually or constructively owns 10 or more of a tenant of host inc or a tenant of any partnership in which host inc is a partner the rent received by host inc either directly or through any such partnership from such tenant generally will not be qualifying income for purposes of the reit income qualification tests of the code and therefore could jeopardize host incs qualification as a reit unless the tenant qualifies as a trs and certain other requirements are met accordingly host incs charter prohibits ownership directly or by attribution by any person or persons acting as a group of more than 98 in value or number whichever is more restrictive of shares of host incs outstanding common stock preferred stock or any other class or series of stock each considered as a separate class or series for this purpose together these limitations are referred to as the ownership limit  stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the intended acquirer of the stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any distributions thereon to vote those shares of stock or to receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the stock in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the stock or the amount realized from the sale a transfer of shares of host incs stock to a person who as a result of the transfer violates the ownership limit may be void under certain circumstances and in any event would deny that person any of the economic benefits of owning shares of host incs stock in excess of the ownership limit these restrictions will not apply if host incs board of directors determines that it no longer is in host incs best interests to continue to qualify as a reit or that compliance with the restrictions on transfer and ownership no longer is required for host inc to qualify as a reit        removal of members of the board of directors host incs charter provides that except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or series of shares of capital stock other than common stock directors may be removed only for cause and by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors vacancies on host incs board of directors may be filled at any regular meeting or at any special meeting called for that purpose by the affirmative vote of the remaining directors except that a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the entire board of directors any vacancy resulting from the removal of a director by the stockholders may be filled by the affirmative vote of holders of at least twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors  25          preferred shares classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval host incs charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that host inc has authority to issue is 1100000000 consisting of 1050000000 shares of common stock and 50000000 shares of preferred stock host incs board of directors has the authority without a vote of stockholders to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock and to establish the terms preferences conversion or other rights voting powers restrictions limitations as to dividends and other distributions qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series because host incs board of directors has this power it may give the holders of any class or series of stock terms preferences powers and rights including voting rights senior to the rights of holders of existing stock        certain provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a thirdparty to acquire control of host inc certain provisions of the mgcl may have the effect of inhibiting a thirdparty from acquiring host inc including     o  business combination provisions that subject to limitations prohibit certain business combinations between a corporation and an interested stockholder defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of the corporations then outstanding shares of voting stock or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who at any time within the twoyear period immediately prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation or an affiliate of any interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and thereafter imposes two supermajority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations and      o  control share provisions that provide that holders of control shares of a corporation defined as voting shares of stock that if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned or controlled by the acquirer would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors acquired in a control share acquisition defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding all interested shares       host inc is subject to the maryland business combination statute our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share provisions of the mgcl there can be no assurance that this bylaw provision exempting us from the control share provisions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future        merger consolidation share exchange and transfer of host incs assets under maryland law and host incs charter subject to the terms of any outstanding class or series of capital stock we can merge with or into another entity consolidate with one or more other entities participate in a share exchange or transfer host incs assets within the meaning of the mgcl if approved 1 by host incs board of directors in the manner provided in the mgcl and 2 by host incs stockholders holding twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter except that any merger of host inc with or into a trust organized for the purpose of changing host incs form of organization from a corporation to a trust requires only the approval of host incs stockholders holding a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the merger under the mgcl specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange only is required to be approved by the board of directors of a maryland corporation if the corporation is the successor entity host incs voluntary dissolution also would require approval of stockholders holding twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter        certain charter and bylaw amendments host incs charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transfer and ownership of host incs stock fixing the size of the board of directors within the range set forth in the charter removal of directors the filling of vacancies exculpation and indemnification of directors calling special stockholder meetings and others all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the board of directors and approved by host incs stockholders holding twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter other charter amendments generally require approval of the board and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter as permitted under the mgcl host incs charter and bylaws provide that the board of directors has the exclusive right to amend host incs bylaws these provisions may make it more difficult to amend host incs charter and bylaws to alter the provisions described herein that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control or the acquisition of host inc common stock without the approval of the board of directors  shares of host incs common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share price of host incs common stock  we have in the past and may in the future issue additional shares of common stock to raise the capital necessary to finance hotel acquisitions fund capital expenditures refinance debt or for other corporate purposes sales of a substantial number of shares of host incs common stock or the perception that sales could occur could affect adversely prevailing market prices for host incs common stock in addition holders of op units who redeem their units and receive at host incs election shares of host inc common stock will be able to sell those shares freely as of december 31 2014 there are approximately 93 million op units outstanding owned by third parties that are redeemable which represents approximately 1 of all outstanding units further a substantial number of shares of host incs common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit  26    plans we currently maintain two stockbased compensation plans i the comprehensive stock plan whereby we may award to participating employees and directors restricted shares of common stock options to purchase common stock and deferred shares of common stock and ii an employee stock purchase plan at december 31 2014 there were approximately 17 million shares of host incs common stock reserved and available for issuance under the comprehensive stock plan and employee stock purchase plan and 08 million outstanding options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of 1735 per share  also as of december 31 2014 host lp had outstanding 400 million principal amount of exchangeable senior debentures that currently are exchangeable for cash shares of host incs common stock or any combination thereof assuming the holders elected to exchange and we elected to settle in shares of host inc common stock the debentures would be exchangeable for approximately 311 million shares based on the current exchange price the exchange price is adjusted proportionately based on dividends paid on host inc common stock while these debentures currently are exchangeable through march 31 2015 based on past trading prices of host inc common stock whether they remain exchangeable after march 31 2015 will depend on the then current trading prices of host inc common stock our earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of host incs common stock  we believe that the market value of a reits equity securities is based primarily upon the markets perception of the reits growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions whether from operations sales acquisitions development or refinancings and secondarily is based upon the value of the underlying assets for that reason shares of host incs common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may impact negatively the market price of host incs common stock our failure to meet the markets expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would affect adversely the market price of host incs common stock  federal income tax risks  adverse tax consequences would occur if host inc or any of its subsidiary reits fail to qualify as a reit we believe that host inc has been organized and has operated in such a manner so as to qualify as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year beginning january 1 1999 and host inc currently intends to continue to operate as a reit during future years in addition host inc owns through host lp two entities that have elected to be treated as reits as the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a reit are limited no assurance can be provided that host inc currently qualifies as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit or that each of host incs subsidiary reits qualify as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit if any of the subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit it is possible that host inc would fail to qualify as a reit unless it or the subsidiary reit could avail itself of certain relief provisions new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change significantly the tax laws with respect to an entitys qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of its reit qualification if host inc or any of its subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit and any available relief provisions did not apply the nonqualifying reit would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates moreover unless entitled to statutory relief the nonqualifying reit would not qualify as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which reit qualification was lost  to qualify as a reit host inc is required to satisfy several asset and income tests our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals our compliance with the reit income and quarterly asset test requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not contend that our hotel leases interests in subsidiaries or interests in securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the reit requirements any determination that host inc or one of its subsidiary reits does not qualify as a reit will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce materially the value of host incs common stock the additional tax liability of host inc or the subsidiary reit for the year or years in which the relevant entity did not qualify as a reit would reduce its net earnings available for investment debt service or distributions to stockholders furthermore the nonqualifying entity no longer would be required to make distributions to its stockholders as a condition to reit qualification and all of its distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary c corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that if host inc were to fail to qualify as a reit host incs stockholders currently taxed as individuals would be taxed on those dividends at capital gain rates and host incs corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the code host incs failure to qualify as a reit also  27    would cause an event of default under host lps credit facility which default could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due thereunder which in turn would constitute an event of default under host lps outstanding debt securities  if our hotel managers do not qualify as eligible independent contractors or if our hotels are not qualified lodging facilities host inc will fail to qualify as a reit each hotel with respect to which our trs lessee pays rent must be a qualified lodging facility a qualified lodging facility is a hotel motel or other establishment more than onehalf of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient basis including customary amenities and facilities provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who legally is authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility we believe that all of the hotels leased to our trs are qualified lodging facilities although we intend to monitor future acquisitions and improvements of hotels the reit provisions of the code provide only limited guidance for making determinations under the requirements for qualified lodging facilities and there can be no assurance that these requirements will be satisfied in all cases if our hotel managers do not qualify as eligible independent contractors host inc likely will fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes each of the hotel management companies that enters into a management contract with our trs must qualify as an eligible independent contractor under the reit rules in order for the rent paid to us by our trs to be qualifying income for our reit income test requirements among other requirements in order to qualify as an eligible independent contractor a hotel manager must not own more than 35 of our outstanding shares by value and no person or group of persons can own more than 35 of our outstanding shares and the ownership interests of the hotel manager taking into account only owners of more than 5 of our shares and with respect to ownership interests in such hotel managers that are publicly traded only holders of more than 5 of such ownership interests complex ownership attribution rules apply for purposes of these 35 thresholds although we monitor ownership of our shares by our hotel managers and their owners and certain provisions of our charter are designed to prevent ownership of our shares in violation of these rules there can be no assurance that these ownership levels will not be exceeded our ownership of our trs will be limited and our transactions with our trs will cause us to be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain income or deductions if those transactions are not conducted on armslength terms a reit may own up to 100 of the equity interest of an entity that is a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the entity is a trs a trs may hold assets and earn income that would not be considered as qualifying assets or as qualifying income if held or earned directly by a reit including gross operating income from hotel operations pursuant to hotel management agreements both the subsidiary and the reit must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a trs a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than 35 of the voting power or value of the stock automatically will be treated as a trs overall no more than 25 of the value of a reits assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trs in addition the trs rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit in order to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation our trs will pay federal income tax and applicable state and local income tax and if applicable foreign income tax on its taxable income and its aftertax net income will be available for distribution to us but is not required to be distributed by such trs to us we believe that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of our trs has been and will be less than 25 of the value of our total assets including our trs stock and securities furthermore we monitor the value of our investments in our trs for the purpose of ensuring compliance with trs ownership limitations there can be no assurance however that we will be able to comply with the 25 limitation discussed above rents paid to us by our trs may not be based on net income or profits to qualify as rents from real property we receive percentage rents calculated based on gross revenues of the hotels subject to leases to our trs  not on net income or profits if the irs determines that the rents charged under our leases with our trs are excessive their deductibility may be challenged at the trs level and we could be subject to a 100 excise tax on redetermined rent or redetermined deductions to the extent rents exceed an arms length amount we believe that our rents reflect normal business practices in this regard but there can be no assurance that the irs will agree despite the reit status of each of host inc and its subsidiary reits we remain subject to various taxes  one of the subsidiary reits of host inc will be required to pay federal income tax at the highest regular corporate rate on builtin gain recognized as a result of the sale of one or more of its hotels prior to the expiration of the applicable 10year holding period including certain hotels acquired from starwood and its affiliates in 2006 the total amount of gain on which the subsidiary reit would be subject to corporate income tax if all of its builtin gain assets were sold in a taxable transaction prior to the expiration of the applicable 10year holding period would be material to it recently enacted legislation however has reduced the 10year period  28    to five years in the case of dispositions of assets in 2012 2013 and 2014 in addition we expect that we could recognize other substantial deferred tax liabilities in the future without any corresponding receipt of cash  notwithstanding host incs status as a reit host inc and our subsidiaries including our subsidiary reits are subject to federal state local and foreign taxes on their income and property in certain cases  host lp is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes and any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc  risks relating to redemption of op units  a holder who offers its op units for redemption may have adverse tax consequences a holder who elects to redeem their op units will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as having sold the op units the sale of these units is a taxable event and the holder thereof will be treated as realizing an amount equal to the sum of 1 the value of the common stock or cash the holder receives and 2 the amount of host lps nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units the gain or loss recognized by the holder of op units is measured by the difference between the amount realized by the holder and the holders tax basis in the op units redeemed which tax basis includes the amount of host lps nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units it is possible that the amount of gain andor the tax liability related thereto that the holder recognizes and pays could exceed the value of the common stock or cash that the holder receives  differences between an investment in shares of host inc common stock and host lp op units may affect redeemed holders of op units if a holder elects to redeem their op units we will determine whether the holder receives cash or shares of host incs common stock in exchange for the op units although an investment in shares of host incs common stock

for a discussion of our hotels      item 3   legal proceedings  in 2005 we initiated a lawsuit against keystonetexas property holding corporation keystone seeking a declaration that a provision of the ground lease for the property under the san antonio marriott rivercenter was valid and claiming that keystone had breached that lease provision keystone filed an amended counterclaim and later a third party claim alleging that we had tortiously interfered with keystones attempted sale of the property and that we slandered keystones title to the property  in 2010 we received an adverse jury verdict in the 166th judicial district court of bexar county texas the jury found that we tortiously interfered with the attempted sale by keystone of the land under the san antonio marriott rivercenter and awarded keystone 343 million in damages plus statutory interest in addition the jury found that we slandered keystones title to the property and awarded keystone 39 million in damages plus statutory interest keystone was only entitled to receive one of these damage awards the jury also awarded keystone 75 million in exemplary damages with respect to the second claim in 2011 a threejudge panel of the san antonio court of appeals issued its memorandum opinion denying our appeal of the trial courts final judgment  in 2012 we filed a petition for review in the texas supreme court on june 13 2014 the texas supreme court reversed the court of appeals judgment and host was no longer liable for the jury verdict and punitive damages award keystone requested a rehearing of the texas supreme courts decision but that motion was denied on october 3 2014 finalizing the texas supreme courts decision as a result in the third quarter of 2014 we reversed the 69 million loss contingency previously recorded related to this litigation and the initial adverse verdict in addition a courtordered bond of 25 million was released on october 17 2014 we are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business including but not limited to disputes involving hotellevel contracts employment litigation compliance with laws such as the americans with disabilities act tax disputes and other  29    general matters we are vigorously defending these claims however no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings we believe based on currently available information that the results of such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but might be material to our operating results for any particular period depending in part upon the operating results for such period we record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated     item 4  mine safety

of properties classified as held for sale the results of operations of properties prior to their disposition and the gain or loss on those dispositions we adopted asu 201408 as of january 1 2014 pursuant to which we only report discontinued operations if a disposal represents a strategic shift no prior year restatements are permitted for this change in policy   36        item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report  overview  host inc operates as a selfmanaged and selfadministered reit that owns properties and conducts operations through host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and in which it holds approximately 99 of its common op units as of december 31 2014 the remainder of host lps common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lps daytoday management and control  host inc is the largest lodging reit in nareits composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotel properties as of february 20 2015 we own 114 hotels in the united states and internationally and have minority ownership interests in an additional 25 hotels through joint ventures in the united states europe and the asiapacific region these hotels are primarily operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry the majority are located in central business districts of major cities near airports and in resortconference destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors since 2004 the percentage of revenues from our target markets has increased from approximately 65 to 80 in 2014 as we have focused our acquisition efforts on these locations and similarly disposed of noncore assets while hotels in these markets still are subject to competitive pressures we believe this strategy of combining quality assets with superior locations provides opportunities to achieve room rate and occupancy premiums in excess of our competitors  our customers fall into three broad groups transient business group business and contract business which accounted for approximately 61 34 and 5 respectively of our 2014 room sales transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels therefore we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than trends in leisure demand for a discussion of our customer categories see   our customers  understanding our performance  our revenues and expenses our hotels are operated by thirdparty managers under longterm agreements pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel we provide operating funds or working capital which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages utilities property taxes and other hotellevel expenses we generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month which distribution reflects hotellevel sales less propertylevel operating expenses excluding depreciation  the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue               of 2014revenues            rooms revenue occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue the business mix of the hotel group versus transient and retail versus discount business is a significant driver of room rates     64                            food and beverage revenue food amp beverage revenues consist of revenues from group functions which may include both banquet revenue and audio and visual revenues as well as outlet revenues from the restaurants and lounges at our properties     29                            other revenue occupancy the nature of the property eg resort etc and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue such as parking golf course spa entertainment and other guest services this category also includes retail and apartment rental revenue     7     37    hotel operating expenses represent approximately 99 of our total operating costs and expenses the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses               of 2014operatingcosts andexpenses            rooms expense these costs include housekeeping reservation systems room supplies laundry services and front desk costs occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages as well as on the level of service and amenities that are provided     20                             food and beverage expense these expenses primarily include food beverage and the associated labor costs and will correlate closely with food and beverage revenues group functions with banquet sales and audio and visual components will generally have lower overall costs as a percentage of revenues than outlet sales     24                             other departmental and support expenses these expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenue such as parking golf courses spas entertainment and other guest services as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments sales and marketing repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs     27                             management fees base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels     5                             other propertylevel expenses these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes ground rent equipment rent and property insurance many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenue at our hotels     8                             depreciation and amortization expense this is a noncash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of past capital expenditures     15      the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations it also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items taken separately these costs represent approximately 55 of our hotel operating expenses  key performance indicators revenue per available room revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved revpar does not include food and beverage parking or other guest service revenues generated by the property although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues it is considered the key indicator of core revenues for many hotels  revpar changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels as well as incremental operating profit than do changes that are driven by average room rate for example increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues such as food and beverage revenue as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services utilities and room amenity costs revpar increases due to higher room rates however will not result in additional roomrelated costs with the exception of those charged as a percentage of revenue as a result changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in revpar caused by occupancy levels  in discussing our operating results we present revpar and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and which operations have been included in our consolidated results comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage or large scale capital improvements we also present revpar separately for our comparable consolidated domestic and international both on a nominal and constant dollar basis hotels as well as for our joint venture in europe we provide revpar results in constant currency due to the number of consolidated properties we have internationally and the effect that exchange rates have on our reporting we use constant currency because we believe it is useful to investors as it provides clarity on how the hotels are performing in their local markets for all other measures net income operating profit ebitda ffo etc our discussion refers only to nominal us which is consistent with our financial statement presentation under gaap 38    we also evaluate the performance of our business through certain nongaap financial measures each of these nongaap financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues operating profit net income and earnings per share we provide a more detailed discussion of these nongaap financial measures how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in nongaap financial measures our nongaap financial measures include        nareit funds from operations ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share we use nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share as supplemental measures of companywide profitability nareit adopted ffo in order to promote an industrywide measure of reit operating performance we also adjust nareit ffo for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt acquisition costs and litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business        comparable hotel ebitda hotel ebitda measures propertylevel results before debt service depreciation and corporate expenses as this is a property level measure and is a supplemental measure of aggregate propertylevel profitability we use hotel ebitda and associated margins to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels        ebitda and adjusted ebitda earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is a supplemental measure of our operating performance and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits hotel owners who are not reits and other capitalintensive companies we also adjust ebitda for gains and losses

presentation see comparable hotel operating statistics 39    in 2014 on a constant us basis revpar at our comparable hotels increased 57 compared to 2013 marking the fifth straight year of comparable revpar growth in excess of 55 our results were impacted by a number of key factors starting with the improving us economy which saw gdp growth and a decline in unemployment though this was partially offset by limited wage growth which tempered consumer spending corporate business a key demand driver of our portfolio experienced slower but solid growth in 2014 when compared to 2013 our domestic gateway properties have benefited from increases in demand from travel to the us as international arrivals increased though we expect that to moderate as a result of the strengthening dollar lastly many of our hotels results were impacted by increased capital expenditures projects in the fourth quarter of 2014 which slowed revpar and profit growth a trend that we expect will be more significant throughout 2015 rooms revpar growth in 2014 at our comparable hotels was both rate and occupancy driven as room rates improved 48 on a constant us basis and occupancy improved 60 basis points to 77 our highest occupancy since our prior peak our operators have been able to leverage the higher occupancy levels in order to gradually increase room rates particularly for our transient business which increased 51 group revenue increased 56 driven by a 27 increase in room nights coupled with a 28 increase in rates group business was inconsistent throughout the year as strong growth in the first and third quarters were each followed by slower growth in the second quarter and a decline in the fourth quarter partially due to renovations comparable revpar at our domestic portfolio increased 54 for the year driven by a 46 improvement in room rates our san francisco and seattle hotels led our domestic portfolio with revpar increases of 152 and 128 respectively as already high levels of demand and solid group business allowed for average room rate increases of approximately 12 in both markets our new york and washington dc markets lagged the portfolio with revpar increases of 33 and 19 respectively as both markets have had a recent influx of new supply the impact of which will continue into 2015 on a constant us basis revpar at our comparable consolidated international hotels increased 102 in 2014 led by our latin american properties with an 184 increase in average room rate and a 233 increase in revpar on a constant us basis the jw marriott hotel rio de janeiro benefited from the fifa world cup resulting in a revpar increase of 273 for the full year comparable revpar in constant euros for the euro jv properties which are unconsolidated increased 25 for the full year reflecting the continued slow growth of the region  rooms expenses increased 48 for the full year on a comparable hotel basis driven by an increase in travel agent commissions and an increase in the rooms hourly wage rate of 31 as a result cost per occupied room increased 40 at our comparable hotels for the year rooms department profit at our comparable hotels increased 55 food and beverage food and beverage revenues at our comparable hotels increased 38 for 2014 the increase was driven primarily by a positive mix shift to banquet and audio visual revenues which provide higher overall operating margins than outlet revenue as catered functions generally are more profitable for the year banquet and audio visual revenues at our comparable hotels increased 51 overall total food and beverage revenues increased by 29 compared to 2013 increased productivity along with the shift of business to banquet and audio visual revenues contributed to a 68 increase in food and beverage department profit for the year other revenues other revenues at our comparable hotels increased 59 due to an increase in garage revenues coupled with higher rents throughout the portfolio  operating profit operating margins calculated based on gaap operating profit as a percentage of gaap revenues increased 340 basis points for the full year 2014 these operating margins are affected significantly by several items including operations from recently acquired hotels dispositions depreciation impairments and corporate expenses our comparable hotel ebitda margins which exclude these items increased 120 basis points to 265 the improvements were driven by the increase in average room rate as well as the 68 increase in comparable food and beverage profit described above additionally declines in several of our expense categories at our comparable hotels including incentive management fees and property insurance as well as below inflationary growth in utilities and nearly flat ground rent contributed to the growth in operating profit margins during 2014 these expense categories are expected to increase at a more normalized level in 2015 which will slow overall margin growth  40    net income for host inc improved 422 million in 2014 to 747 million host incs diluted income per common share improved 054 per common share to 096 per common share net income and diluted income per share benefited from the following       adjusted ebitda increased 96 million or 74 to 14 billion reflecting improvement in hotel operations and an increase in adjusted ebitda from our unconsolidated joint ventures partially offset by a decline due to the net effect of our recent acquisitions and dispositions       a decrease in interest expense of 90 million due to a reduction in the overall debt balance and weighted average interest rate combined with a decline in debt extinguishments costs compared to the prior year the growth in earnings coupled with the decrease in interest expense resulted in an increase in host incs adjusted ffo per diluted share of 145 to 150 per diluted share        an increase in gains on asset sales of 105 million in 2013 certain of the gains are included in discontinued operations and       a gain of 71 million recorded in 2014 for the successful resolution of litigation the trends and transactions described above for host inc affected similarly the operating results for host lp as the only significant difference between the host inc and host lp statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the outside partners of host lp for the year host lps net income improved 422 million to 747 million and the diluted income per common unit improved 056 per common unit to 099 per common unit  2015 outlook  for 2015 we expect continued strength in the us lodging industry as overall growth in gdp driven by strong employment consumer confidence and business investment is expected to continue to drive consistent demand growth at the same time we anticipate that supply growth will increase compared to recent years but will remain below historical levels for the industry overall although growth in individual markets may vary as a result we anticipate solid revpar growth in the us lodging industry during 2015 as occupancy levels at our properties in target markets and gateway cities are currently at or near prior peak levels we expect that the majority of the growth will be rate driven which should lead to improvements in our operating margins and results we anticipate that our results will be driven by strong transient demand and improvement in group performance  in the nearterm we are anticipating that certain trends will negatively impact our 2015 results our portfolio has a large exposure to new york and washington dc which represent 27 of our revenues these markets recently have experienced above market levels of supply growth we continue to believe that these are strong gateway markets that will drive longterm value however the recent supply growth is expected to cause these markets to underperform in 2015 we also expect the growth in international travel to our gateway markets to slow in 2015 due to the relative strength in the us dollar and weakness in the global economy further we will be completing several significant renovations at many of our largest hotels in 2015 as our redevelopment and return on investment capital expenditures are expected to more than double over 2014 levels when operating at high occupancy these renovations have more noticeable disruption effects based on these factors we anticipate that the overall strength of the lodging industry partially offset by shortterm challenges in our portfolio will lead to domestic yearoveryear growth in revpar of 475 to 575 we expect the increase in united states lodging demand to outpace international growth in europe while there are areas of growth the overall economy remains in a tenuous position as strategies to promote overall growth compete with sovereign debt issues additionally the slowdown in chinas growth and the decline in oil prices are expected to impact lodging demand in commodity driven countries such as australia canada chile and brazil where we have direct investments difficult yearoveryear comparisons such as the world cup in brazil in 2014 also will weigh on revpar growth as a result we expect our revpar for our consolidated international portfolio to be flat to an increase of 20 compared to 2014 on a constant dollar basis  for the portfolio as a whole we anticipate that revpar on a constant us basis will increase 45 to 55 however growth in net income operating profit and adjusted ebitda will be affected negatively by hotel sales and renovation disruption at several of our properties despite the growth in revpar while we believe that the lodging industry will continue to improve there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons including but not limited to slower than anticipated growth in the economy greater than anticipated disruption from renovations to our hotels and changes in travel patterns see part i item 1a risk factors 41    strategic initiatives portfolio  acquisitions and development we continue to seek investment opportunities in our target markets which we have identified as those that are expected over the long term to have the greatest lodging demand growth the fewest additions to supply and the strongest potential for revenue growth we see increased competition for acquisitions in our target markets due to the accessibility of capital and the current availability of inexpensive financing consequently pricing for upper upscale and luxury assets has become more aggressive and recent transaction values have approached replacement cost levels a trend we expect to continue in 2015 in 2014 we acquired one hotel in each of our target markets of san francisco and miami and both hotels are managed by independent operators as follows       on january 21 2014 we acquired the 151room powell hotel in san francisco including the fee simple interest in the land for 75 million the property is located in the heart of downtown san francisco two blocks from union square three blocks from the moscone convention center and across from the historic cable car turnaround the property includes a significant longterm retail lease with sephora a leading provider of perfume and cosmetics the hotel operated by kokua hospitality currently is closed for renovation and will reopen in september 2015 and will be renamed the axiom hotel        on august 11 2014 we acquired the 242room b2 miami downtown hotel for approximately 58 million the hotel is located in miamis business and financial district within walking distance of the american airlines arena across from bayfront park and with unobstructed water views the hotel has been renamed the yve hotel miami and is being managed by destination hotels amp resorts        in the fourth quarter of 2014 we opened the 149room novotel and 256room ibis rio de janeiro parque olimpico in barra da tijuca both managed by accor our total investment in the development project was r139 million 65 million  dispositions  we sold five properties in 2014 for a total sales price of 519 million including an 89 interest of the philadelphia marriott downtown these properties are noncore assets where we believe the potential for growth is constrained or where we were able to take advantage of attractive pricing in the market for further detail see liquidity and capital resources during 2015 we believe the disposition market should remain favorable including increased interest in secondary markets as a result of increased liquidity  capital investment  value enhancement we also look to enhance the value of our portfolio by identifying and executing strategies seeking to achieve the highest and best use of all aspects of our properties this may include extending ground leases or restructuring management agreements as well as developing or disposing of underutilized space connected to our properties we believe that the successful execution of these projects will create significant value for the company significant value enhancement initiatives include       in december 2014 we opened hyatt kaanapali beach a hyatt residence club in which we hold a 67 noncontrolling interest the 131unit vacation ownership project in maui hawaii is adjacent to our hyatt regency maui resort amp spa the total development cost of the project as of december 31 2014 was approximately 180 million of which 86 million was financed through a construction loan in 2014 the maui jv recognized 54 million in sales of the timeshare units        in collaboration with vornado realty trust on november 18 2014 we unveiled a 25000 square foot highdefinition digital advertising display alongside the new york marriott marquis the remaining redevelopment and leasing of the retail space of the hotel is scheduled to be completed by late 2015        we have extended the ground lease by 30 years through 2104 at the atlanta marriott suites midtown and obtained flexibility with respect to lease provisions that govern the brand operator and sublease provisions of the asset in return for a small increase in minimum rent additionally in february 2015 we completed the purchase of the ground lease at the sheraton indianapolis hotel at keystone crossing along with two outparcels for 46 million capital expenditures projects we continue to pursue opportunities to enhance asset value through select capital improvements including projects that are designed specifically to increase the ecoefficiency of our hotels incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology capital expenditures have totaled approximately 24 billion

operating statistics revpar improvements were led by properties in our west coast markets including san francisco and seattle where comparable revpar increased 152 and 128 respectively both markets benefited from already high levels of demand and solid group business allowing for significant rate improvements for both group and transient business our hotels in these markets also benefited from postrenovation improvements 50    additionally our los angeles and san diego markets experienced a 74 and 61 growth in revpar respectively the los angeles revpar growth was driven by an 89 improvement in rate the result of strong group and transient demand which allowed for a reduction in discounted room nights the revpar growth at our san diego hotels was due to a combination of rate growth of 38 and an increase in occupancy of 18 percentage points steady transient demand at these hotels led to a favorable business mix shift to higherrated transient segments with average occupancy over 80 for full year 2014 our hawaii hotels experienced a 71 increase in average rate as the business mix shifted to higherrated leisure travelers including customers previewing the new timeshare project adjacent to the hyatt regency maui resort amp spa  in comparison our east coast properties lagged the portfolio primarily reflecting results in new york and washington dc where recent new supply has limited revpar growth to 33 and 19 respectively our boston market generally was inline with the portfolio with revpar improvement of 50 this improvement reflected an increase in rate of 78 offset by a decrease in occupancy of 21 percentage points partially due to less favorable comparisons due to the world series events in 2013 our florida market outperformed for the year with an increase in comparable revpar of 85 compared to 2013 due to the combination of an increase in average room rate of 51 and an increase in occupancy of 25 percentage points as our resort properties performed well benefiting from an increase in both transient and group business our central markets were led by our denver properties as comparable revpar increased 112 driven by a mix of strong citywide demand driving a 57 increase in rate as well as an increase in occupancy of 33 percentage points our chicago and houston markets underperformed with revpar increases of 27 and 09 respectively the chicago market was affected by severe winter weather and a decrease in citywide events while the houston market was affected by renovation activity at some of our larger properties and the decline in oil prices  our international markets experienced a strong growth in revpar of 102 led by our latin american properties with revpar growth of 233 on a constant us basis as the jw marriott hotel rio de

comparable hotel operating statistics our airport properties led the portfolio for the year with revpar growth of 98 driven by strong rate growth at our west coast airport properties our urban properties experienced revpar growth of 42 as some of our more concentrated urban markets such as new york and washington dc experienced slower growth due to increased supply the revpar improvements at our suburban properties of 73 was driven by an increase in rates of 61 as high occupancy levels in urban markets has helped drive demand in adjacent suburban markets an increase in leisure travel and corporate group demand in 2014 led to a 72 increase in revpar at our resort properties reflecting a 56 increase in rate growth and improvement in occupancy of more than 1 percentage point hotel sales by business mix our customers fall into three broad categories transient group and contract business the information below is derived from business mix results from 106 comparable hotels for

growth in the first and third quarters offset by slow growth in the second quarter and a slight decline in the fourth quarter the inconsistency primarily can be attributed to timing of holidays throughout the year as well as significant renovation activity in the fourth quarter  51    overall group revenues improved 56 compared to the prior year consisting of a 28 average room rate increase coupled with a 27 growth in group room nights sold corporate and association group revenue increased by a combined 50 while other groups revenue both leisure and government groups grew by a combined 74 during 2014 transient revenues increased 51 when compared to 2013 reflecting an increase in average room rate of 49 and a 02 increase in nights sold the transient average room rate increase

operations in february compared to 2013 due to the leap year in 2012 for 2013 our top performing markets were houston seattle and san francisco with revpar increases of 151 109 and 102 respectively the increase in our houston market primarily resulted from higher average room rates as these hotels shifted  52    from lowerrated group and transient business to higherrated segments as well as aggressive pricing increases in group for both retail and special corporate business the increase in our seattle market reflects a 67 increase in average room rate and a 30 percentage point increase in average occupancy driven by higherrated group and transient demand revpar growth in our san francisco market was driven entirely by rate improvements from an improved business mix occupancy declined slightly during the year but still remained at over 80 as strong transient and group demand throughout the city have translated to revpar gains at our properties  revpar for our atlanta hotels increased 96 for 2013 reflecting a strong citywide and special event calendar during the year that drove group and transient demand for 2013 our los angeles market revpar increased 78 primarily due to improved average room rates as a result of increased transient business driven by a mix shift to higherrated segments and increased corporate group business for 2013 our florida hotels increased revpar 73 as a result of a 54 increase in average room rate and a 13 percentage point increase in average occupancy driven by strong leisure demand our boston market revpar increased 72 as a result of a 35 percentage point increase in average occupancy and a 24 increase in average room rate due to strong group performance and transient business due in part to major league baseballs playoff and world series events and the favorable 2012 comparisons related to hurricane sandy  our new york hotels increased revpar 60 as a result of a 31 percentage point increase in average occupancy and a 22 increase in average room rate in 2012 revpar growth was affected negatively by hurricane sandy in the fourth quarter and renovation disruption at several of our new york hotels in 2013 revpar results have been tempered by supply growth in this market for 2013 our washington dc market revpar increased only 10 due to a 10 percentage point increase in average occupancy resulting from transient room nights for 2013 the sequestration and us federal government shutdown negatively impacted this market by lowering demand for government and related industry business revpar in our asiapacific and canadian markets increased 81 and 65 respectively on a constant us basis for 2013 the increase at our asiapacific hotels resulted from a 48 increase in average room rate and a 25 percentage point increase in average occupancy driven by transient demand and the results of renovations completed in 2012 the improvement in revpar at our canadian hotels primarily was driven by an increase in average room rate revpar at our latin american properties decreased 19 on a constant us basis largely due to a decrease in occupancy the nominal revpar results of our international

year      2  for a discussion of our property types see comparable hotel operating statistics 53    for 2013 our suburban properties led the portfolio with a 71 increase in revpar as stable average occupancy levels at these properties have allowed operators to increase average daily room rates we believe strong demand that has led to high average occupancy and increasing rates in adjacent urban markets has contributed to an increase in demand at our suburban properties for 2013 our resortconference hotels experienced revpar growth of 67 driven by a 48 increase in average room rate and a 12 percentage point increase in average occupancy due to higher demand our urban properties experienced a revpar growth of 52 for 2013 as results were mixed throughout these markets strength in several of our west coast markets as well as in our houston and atlanta markets partially were offset by weakness in our washington dc and philadelphia markets  hotel sales by business mix  the information below is derived from business mix results from 102 comparable hotels for which 2013 and 2012 business mix information is available in 2013 overall revenue growth was due mainly to transient revenues improving 75 compared to the prior year consisting of a 40 average room rate increase coupled with a 34 growth in transient room nights sold the transient average room rate increase resulted from a combination of segment price increases and an increasingly favorable business mix higherrated retail and nonqualified discount transient room nights increased 91 for the year while lowerrated special corporate government and discount segments decreased 09 during 2013 group revenues increased 26 when compared to 2012 reflecting an increase in average room rate of 28 while group room nights sold declined 02 corporate and association group revenues increased 99 and 26 respectively while discount group revenue decreased 84  liquidity and capital resources  liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp the liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp are derived primarily from the activities of host lp which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations the incurrence of debt the issuance of op units or the sale of properties host inc is a reit and its only significant asset is the ownership of partnership interests of host lp therefore its financing and investing activities are conducted through host lp except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock proceeds from stock issuances by host inc are contributed to host lp in exchange for op units additionally funds used by host inc to pay dividends or to repurchase stock are provided by host lp therefore while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between host inc and host lp we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion applies both to host inc and host lp  overview we look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash debt and equity in order to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry we believe this strategy will result in a lower overall cost of capital allow us to complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions at all times in the lodging cycle and will position us to manage potential declines in operations caused by the inherent volatility in the lodging industry as operations have improved in the past several years we have executed successfully on our strategy to decrease our leverage as measured by our net debttoebitda ratio and reduce our debt service obligations leading to an increase in our fixed charge coverage ratio currently these financial metrics as defined in in our credit facility are stronger than at any point since we split from marriott international in 1993 these improvements were due to stronger operations but also were accomplished through acquisitions and other investments the majority of which were completed with available cash and proceeds from equity issuances and the repayment and refinancing of senior notes and mortgage debt in order to extend maturity dates and obtain lower interest rates  as we continue to achieve our balance sheet objectives we intend to use available cash predominantly for acquisitions or other investments in our portfolio to the extent that we are able to find suitable investment opportunities that meet our return requirements if we are unable to find appropriate investment opportunities and assuming operations continue to improve we may over time consider other uses of any available cash such as a return of capital through dividends or common stock repurchases  we have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt we have access to multiple types of financing as approximately 90 of our debt consists of senior notes exchangeable debentures and borrowings under our credit facility none of which are collateralized by specific hotel properties our senior unsecured debt is rated investment grade by moodys investor services fitch ratings and standard amp poors rating service which management believes will allow us to borrow capital at better rates than previously achieved in 2014 we were able to amend and restate our senior unsecured credit facility lowering the margin on our allin pricing by 30 basis points on the revolver portion and 325 basis points on the term loan and extending the maturity date we also repaid 371 million of senior notes and draws on our credit facility and 384 million of mortgage and other debt additionally 96 of our hotels as measured by revenues are unencumbered by mortgage debt  54    we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our portfolio withstand declines in operating cash flow pay nearterm debt maturities and fund our capital expenditures programs we may continue to access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist in order to further enhance our liquidity and to fund cash needs the table below details our significant cash flows for the three years ended december 31 in millions              2014        2013        2012       cash

facility and debt and equity issuances  the following graph summarizes our aggregate debt maturities as of february 20 2015                        1  the debt maturing in 2015 assumes the exercise of a put option by the holders of our exchangeable senior debentures     2  the term loan and credit facility agreements contain extension options that would extend the maturity of both instruments to 2019 subject to meeting certain conditions  55    capital resources we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth including acquisitions as a result the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure our financial flexibility including our ability to incur debt make distributions and make investments is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of such indebtedness which include among other things the allowable amounts of leverage interest coverage and fixed charges  if at any time we determine that market conditions are favorable after taking into account our liquidity requirements we may cause host lp to issue senior notes or debentures exchangeable for shares of host inc common stock given our total debt level and maturity schedule we also will continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time taking advantage of favorable market conditions in february 2015 host incs board of directors authorized repurchases of up to 500 million of senior notes exchangeable debentures and mortgage debt other than in accordance with its terms we may purchase senior notes and exchangeable debentures for cash through open market purchases privately negotiated transactions a tender offer or in some cases through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and ffo per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs in addition while we intend to use any available cash predominantly for acquisitions or other investments in our hotel portfolio to the extent we do not identify appropriate investments we may elect in the future to use available cash for other uses including share repurchases accordingly in light of our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets we may at any time subject to applicable securities laws be considering or be in discussions with respect to the repurchase or issuance of exchangeable debentures andor senior notes or the repurchase or sale of common stock any such transactions may subject to applicable securities laws occur simultaneously  we continue actively to explore potential acquisitions and anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from sales of properties but also potentially from equity offerings of host inc or by issuances of op units by host lp the incurrence of debt available cash or advances under our credit facility given the nature of these transactions we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review bid on or negotiate to purchase we may acquire additional properties through various structures including transactions involving single assets portfolios joint ventures and acquisitions of the securities or assets of other reits  counterparty credit risk we are subject to counterparty credit risk which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential nonperformance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price we assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligation to determine the impact if any of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition we are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions access to our credit facility and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited our exposure with regard to our cash and the 796 million available under our credit facility is mitigated as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions at december 31 2014 the exposure risk related to our derivative contracts totaled 13 million and the counterparties were investment grade financial institutions  sources and uses of cash in 2014 our sources of cash included cash from operations and proceeds from asset sales uses of cash during the year consisted of acquisitions investments in our joint ventures capital expenditures operating costs debt repayments and repurchases and distributions to equity holders we anticipate that our sources and uses of cash will be similar during 2015  cash provided by operations our cash provided by operations for 2014 increased 131 million to 1150 million compared to 2013 primarily due to improved operations at our hotels and a decrease in cash interest payments  cash used in investing activities approximately 93 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2014 compared to 75 million in 2013 in addition to the acquisition investment and disposition activity detailed in the charts below we spent approximately 436 million on capital expenditures the same level as in 2013 our renewal and replacement capital expenditures for 2014 were approximately 324 million which reflects an increase of approximately 7 from 2013 levels our renewal and replacement capital expenditures generally are funded by the furniture fixture

million of our exchangeable senior debentures that are subject to a put option by holders in that year  senior notes the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issued by host lp to which we refer collectively as the senior notes indenture we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semiannually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above under the terms of our senior notes indenture our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of host lps unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host lp  59    pledges and guarantees under the senior notes indenture all host lp subsidiaries which guarantee host lp debt are required to similarly guarantee debt issuances under the indenture also to the extent the equity of any subsidiaries of host lp is pledged to secure borrowings under the credit facility such collateral likewise is required to secure senior note issuances under the senior notes indenture while the credit facility currently does not include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests such guarantees or pledges subsequently will be required in the event that host lps leverage ratio exceeds 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility as well as the senior notes issued under the senior notes indenture and certain hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility if triggered the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain us and canadian subsidiaries of host lp and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would not provide guarantees or pledges of equity interests further if at any time our leverage ratio falls below 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters or host lp has an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating such guarantees and pledges may be released  series d senior notes restrictive covenants  in march 2013 we completed an underwritten public offering of 400 million aggregate principal amount of series d senior notes bearing interest at a rate of 375 per year due in 2023 the series d senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the october 15 2023 maturity date except at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium as set forth in the senior notes indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date the notes were issued under our existing senior notes indenture and have covenants customary for investment grade debt primarily limitations on our ability to incur debt there are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends because these senior notes were issued after we attained an investment grade rating while all other series of our senior notes were issued before we had attained an investment grade rating the covenants of these senior notes are different than the covenants applicable to our other senior notes  under the terms of the series d senior notes host lps ability to incur indebtedness is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions including the achievement of an ebitdatointerest coverage ratio of at least 15x by host lp as calculated this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on host lps consolidated statement of operations in addition the calculation is based on host lps pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to certain transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period other covenants limiting host lps ability to incur indebtedness include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65 of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values maintaining secured indebtedness of less than 40 of adjusted total assets and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150 of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured indebtedness of host lp and its subsidiaries so long as host lp maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture it may incur additional debt  we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants applicable to our series d senior notes the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture for our series d senior notes and our actual credit ratios as of december 31 2014              actual ratio        covenant requirement    unencumbered assets tests        489       minimum ratio of 150    total indebtedness to total assets        21       maximum ratio of 65    secured indebtedness to total assets        2       maximum ratio of 40    ebitdatointerest coverage ratio        73  x     minimum ratio of 15x   prior series of senior notes restrictive covenants currently our senior notes have an investment grade rating from both moodys and standard amp poors as a result many of the restrictive covenants contained in the senior notes indenture and the supplemental indentures for our prior series of senior notes are not applicable as they do not apply for so long as such series of notes maintain an investment grade rating from both moodys and standard amp poors the following primary covenants continue to apply to our existing senior notes other than our series d senior notes       restrict our ability to sell all or substantially all of our assets or merge with or into other companies and       require us to make an offer to repurchase the existing senior notes then currently outstanding upon the occurrence of a change of control 60    if our senior notes no longer are rated investment grade by either or both of moodys and standard amp poors then the following covenants and other restrictions will be reinstated for our existing senior notes but will not apply to the series d senior notes which have different covenants        our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions will be subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions including the achievement of an ebitdatointerest coverage ratio of at least 20x we will be able to make distributions to enable host inc to pay dividends on its preferred stock if any under the senior notes indenture when our ebitdatointerest coverage ratio is above 17 to 10 this ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture applicable to our existing senior notes based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan in order to establish the debt at fair value and during the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 16 million of noncash interest which represents interest expense recorded as a result of the implementation in 2009 of an accounting requirement relating to our outstanding exchangeable senior debentures these amounts are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations       other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions would include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65 of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values excluding intangible assets and maintaining secured indebtedness and subsidiary indebtedness of less than 45 of adjusted total assets so long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture applicable to our existing senior notes we may make preferred or common op unit distributions and incur additional debt including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and make distributions when our senior notes no longer are rated investment grade we still will be permitted to incur certain types of debt including i credit facility debt ii refinancing debt iii up to 400 million of mortgage debt which proceeds would be used to repay debt under the credit facility and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount and iv up to 150 million of other debt we also will be permitted to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain host incs reit status       a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets based on undepreciated book values of not less than 125 of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other debt not secured by mortgages this coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or make distributions discussed above which consequences where we fall below the coverage level are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or make distributions but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture and       our ability to make distributions on redeem or repurchase our op units permit payment or distribution restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries sell assets enter into transactions with affiliates and create certain liens will be restricted the following summarizes the actual credit ratios for our existing senior notes other than the series d senior notes as of december 31 2014 and the covenant requirements contained in the senior notes indenture that would be applicable at such times as our existing senior notes no longer are rated investment grade by either of moodys or standard amp poors even if we were to lose the investment grade rating we would be in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the senior notes indenture

between our series d senior notes and our other senior notes our actual ratios as reported can be slightly different  exchangeable debentures as of december 31 2014 we have 400 million of 2½ exchangeable senior debentures outstanding that were issued on december 22 2009 the 2009 debentures the 2009 debentures are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes holders have the right to require us to purchase the 2009 debentures at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest the put option on october 15 2015 and on certain other subsequent dates holders of the 2009 debentures also have the right to exchange the 2009 debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions including at any time at which the closing price of host incs common stock is more than 130 of the exchange price per share for at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the calendar quarter or at any time up to two days prior to the date on which the 2009 debentures have been called for redemption we can redeem for cash all or part of the 2009 debentures at any time subsequent  61    to october 20 2015 at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus accrued interest if at any time we elect to redeem the 2009 debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price we would expect the holders to elect to exchange the 2009 debentures at the respective exchange value rather than receive the cash redemption price the exchange value is equal to the applicable exchange rate multiplied by the price of host incs common stock upon exchange the 2009 debentures would be exchanged for host incs common stock cash or a combination thereof at our option as of december 31 2014 the closing price of host incs common stock exceeded 130 of the exchange price for more than 20 of 30 consecutive prior trading days therefore the 2009 debentures are exchangeable by holders through march 31 2015 whether the 2009 debentures continue to be exchangeable after march 31 2015 will depend on future trading prices of host incs common stock currently each 1000 debenture would be exchanged for 778265 host inc common shares for an equivalent per share price of 1285 for a total of 311 million shares for additional detail on the initial valuation of the 2009 debentures and the related interest expense see item 8

and warranties  credit facility term loan the june 2014 credit facility contained a term loan facility of 500 million which replaced and refinanced the term loan under our prior facility of like amount the term loan facility contains an option for us to increase the aggregate principal amount of the term loan facility by up to 500 million in the future subject to obtaining additional loan commitments and the satisfaction of the other conditions specified in the credit facility the term loan facility has an initial scheduled maturity of june 2017 with two oneyear renewal options subject to certain conditions including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties  the term loan does not require any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity the term loan otherwise is subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees and pledges of security interests in subsidiaries operational covenants financial covenants and events of default as discussed below  collateral and guarantees the credit facility does not currently include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests in our subsidiaries or any other security and the guarantees and pledges are required only in the event that host lps leverage ratio exceeds 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility as well as the notes outstanding under host lps senior notes indenture interest rate and currency hedges and certain other hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility even when triggered the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain us and canadian subsidiaries of host lp and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would provide neither guarantees nor pledges of equity interests further if at any time our leverage ratio falls below 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters or host lp has an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating such guarantees and pledges may be released  prepayments voluntary prepayments of the loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty the loans under the credit facility are required to be prepaid in the event that asset sales reduce adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values to below 10 billion if we do not reinvest the proceeds of those asset sales in new properties at december 31 2014 we have adjusted total assets as defined in our credit facility of 19 billion  financial covenants  the credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 725x our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 175x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 125x the financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility hence so long as there are no amounts outstanding thereunder and the term loan is repaid we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the credit facility in the future if we were ever to regain compliance with the financial covenants these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period under the terms of the credit facility interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of  62    debt deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan in order to establish its fair value and noncash interest expense due to the implementation in 2009 of accounting standards relating to our exchangeable debentures all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations additionally total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a net debt concept pursuant to which cash and cash equivalents in excess of 100 million are deducted from our total debt balance  we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility as of december 31

are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 60x as currently is the case in particular at any time that our leverage ratio is below 60x we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures and the limitations on acquisitions investments dividends and distributions contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture additionally the credit facilitys restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and distributions generally are consistent with our senior notes indenture these provisions under certain circumstances limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain host incs tax status as a reit  the credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature and provides that upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders commitments may be terminated in addition upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default all amounts due under the credit facility will automatically become due and payable and the lenders commitments automatically will terminate

these expenditures into later years      3  the amounts shown include deferred management fees and the estimated amount of tax expense under terms of our management agreements we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owners priority to us the timing of the payments if any is based on future operations the termination of the management agreement or the sale of the hotel and is therefore not determinable the estimated amount of tax expense relates to uncertain tax liabilities  67    tax sharing arrangements under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies such as marriott international inc hms host and barceló crestline corporation we are obligated to pay certain taxes federal state local and foreign including any related interest and penalties relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us for example a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us this adjustment could produce a tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement additionally under the partnership agreement between host inc and host lp host lp is obligated to pay certain taxes federal state local and foreign including any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc as well as any liabilities the irs may successfully assert against host inc we do not expect any amounts paid under these tax sharing arrangements to be material  tax indemnification agreements as a result of certain federal and state income tax considerations of the former owners of two hotels currently owned by host lp we have agreed to restrictions on selling such hotels or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods one of these agreements expires in 2028 and the other in 2031  guarantees we have entered into certain guarantees which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt that are not recorded on our books due to various dispositions spinoffs and contractual arrangements but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote for a discussion of the largest guarantees by dollar amount see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 16 guarantees and contingencies  critical accounting policies  our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates we evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to the impairment of longlived assets on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the following critical accounting policies

additionally see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 8 employee stock plans for more information application of new accounting standards in april 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu 201408 presentation of financial statements topic 205 and property plant and equipment topic 360  reporting discontinued operations and disclosure of disposal of components of an entity asu 201408 reporting for discontinued operations under this standard a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations only if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results in addition it requires an entity to present for each comparative period the assets and liabilities of a disposal group that includes a discontinued operation separately in the asset and liability sections respectively of the statement of financial position as a result the operations through the  68    date of the disposal and the gain or loss on the sale of properties will be included in continuing operations unless the sale represents a strategic shift we adopted this standard as of january 1 2014 no prior year restatements are permitted for this change in policy  in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 which affects virtually all aspects of an entitys revenue recognition the core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 we have not yet completed our assessment of the effect of the new standard on our financial statements including possible transition alternatives   our customers  our customers fall into three broad groups transient business group business and contract business similar to the majority of the lodging industry we further categorize business within these broad groups based on characteristics they have in common as follows  transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels therefore we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than trends in leisure demand the four key subcategories of the transient business group are        retail this is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the general public it typically is the rate charged to travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discounted rates it includes the rack rate which typically is applied to rooms during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available retail room rates will fluctuate more freely depending on anticipated demand levels eg seasonality and weekday vs weekend stays        nonqualified discount these include special rates offered by the hotels including packages advancepurchase discounts and promotional offers these also include rooms booked through online travel agencies otas        special corporate this is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally these rates typically are negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated retail rate in addition this category includes rates offered at the prevailing per diem for approved government travel       qualified discount this category encompasses all discount programs such as aaa and aarp discounts rooms booked through wholesale channels frequent guest program redemptions and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel  group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together usually with a minimum of 10 rooms the three key subcategories of the group business category are        association group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions        corporate group business related to corporate meetings eg product launches training programs contract negotiations and presentations        other group business predominately related to social military education religious fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams otherwise known as smerf business  contract business refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our airport hotels additionally contract rates may be utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand  comparable hotel operating statistics  to facilitate a yeartoyear comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics ie revpar average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues expenses hotel ebitda and associated margins for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance  69    because these statistics and operating results relate only to our hotel properties they exclude results for our nonhotel properties and other real estate investments we define our comparable hotels as properties      i  that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and      ii  that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone largescale capital projects as further defined below during the reporting periods being compared  the hotel business is capitalintensive and renovations are a regular part of the business generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels a large scale capital project that would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set is an extensive renovation of several core aspects of the hotel such as rooms meeting space lobby bars restaurants and other public spaces both quantitative and qualitative factors are taken into consideration in determining if the renovation would cause a hotel to be removed from the comparable hotel set including unusual or exceptional circumstances such as a reduction or increase in room count rebranding a significant alteration of the business operations or the closing of the hotel during the renovation  we do not include an acquired hotel in our comparable hotel set until the operating results for that hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year for example we acquired the hyatt place waikiki beach in may of 2013 the hotel will not be included in our comparable hotel set until january 1 2015 hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption or commence a largescale capital project in each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after completion of the repair of the property damage or cessation of the business interruption or the completion of largescale capital projects as applicable  of the 114 hotels that we owned on december 31 2014 106 have been classified as comparable hotels the operating results of the following hotels that we owned or leased as of december 31 2014 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods        novotel rio de janeiro parque olimpico

in october 2013 including renovations of 450 rooms including 35 suites restaurant façade and windows       hyatt place waikiki beach acquired in may 2013       novotel christchurch cathedral square business interruption due to the closure of the hotel following an earthquake in february 2011 and the subsequent extensive renovations which hotel reopened in august 2013 and       orlando world

main pool and a complete restoration and enhancement of the hotel including new water slides and activity areas new pool dining facilities and the renovation of one tower of guestrooms meeting space and restaurants  the operating results of ten hotels disposed of in 2014 and 2013 are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein  as of december 31 2013 105 of our 115 hotels were classified as comparable the operating results of the following hotels that we owned or leased as of december 31 2013 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods        the ritzcarlton naples       hyatt place waikiki beach       grand hyatt washington acquired in july 2012        the westin new york grand central business interruption due to rebranding of the hotel

indianapolis hotel at keystone crossing removed in the first quarter of 2011 business interruption due to extensive renovations that were completed in january 2013 including the conversion of one tower of the hotel into apartments reducing the room count and the renovation of the remaining guest rooms lobby bar and meeting space  we evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels

airports  71    constant us nominal us and constant euros operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period for comparative purposes we also present the revpar results for 2013 assuming the results of our foreign operations were translated using the same exchange rates that were effective for the comparable periods in 2014 thereby eliminating the effect of currency fluctuation for the yearoveryear comparisons we believe this presentation is useful to investors as it provides clarity with respect to the growth in revpar in the local currency of the hotel consistent with the manner in which we would evaluate our domestic portfolio however the effect of changes in foreign currency has been reflected in the actual results of net income ebitda earnings per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share nominal us results include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation we also present revpar results for our joint venture in europe in constant euros using the same methodology as used for the constant us presentation  nongaap financial measures  we use certain nongaap financial measures which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap within the meaning of applicable sec rules these measures are as follows i ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp ii funds from operations ffo and ffo per diluted share both nareit and adjusted as a measure of performance for host inc and iii comparable hotel property level operating results as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp  we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the nareit definition of ffo or do not calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance in addition although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to nonreits we also calculate adjusted ffo per diluted share which measure is not in accordance with nareit guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other reits ebitda and adjusted ebitda as presented also may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with gaap cash expenditures for various longterm assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures interest expense for ebitda and adjusted ebitda purposes only and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the ebitda adjusted ebitda nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share presentations management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our nongaap financial measures additionally nareit ffo per diluted share adjusted ffo per diluted share ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions in addition nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as a measure of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders benefit the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance  ebitda and adjusted ebitda  ebitda  earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries management believes ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization management also believes the use of ebitda facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits hotel owners that are not reits and other capitalintensive companies management uses ebitda to evaluate propertylevel results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs  72    adjusted ebitda  historically management has adjusted ebitda when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of adjusted ebitda when combined with the primary gaap presentation of net income is beneficial to an investors complete understanding of our operating performance adjusted ebitda also is a relevant measure in calculating certain credit ratios we adjust ebitda for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as adjusted ebitda        real estate transactions  we exclude the effect of gains and losses including the amortization of deferred gains recorded on the disposition or acquisition of depreciable assets and property insurance gains in our consolidated statement of operations because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets in addition material gains or losses from the depreciated book value of the disposed assets could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value often does not reflect its market value as noted below for ffo        equity investment adjustments  we exclude the equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated investments in partnerships and joint ventures as presented in our consolidated statement of operations because it includes our pro rata portion of depreciation amortization and interest expense which are excluded from ebitda we include our pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our equity investments as we believe this more accurately reflects the performance of our investments the pro rata adjusted ebitda of equity investments is defined as the ebitda of our equity investments adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by our percentage ownership in the partnership or joint venture        consolidated partnership adjustments  we deduct the noncontrolling partners pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our consolidated partnerships as this reflects the noncontrolling owners interest in the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships the pro rata adjusted ebitda of noncontrolling partners is defined as the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by the noncontrolling partners positions in the partnership or joint venture        cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  infrequently the financial accounting standards board fasb promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle we exclude these onetime adjustments because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period        impairment losses  we exclude the effect of impairment expense recorded because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets in addition we believe that impairment expense which is based on historical cost book values is similar to gains losses on dispositions and depreciation expense both of which also are excluded from ebitda        acquisition costs  under gaap costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company        litigation gains and losses  effective april 1 2013 we have excluded the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business which is consistent with the definition of adjusted ffo that we adopted effective january 1 2011 we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance in unusual circumstances we also may adjust ebitda for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance for example in the first quarter of 2013 management excluded the 11 million gain from the eminent domain claim for land adjacent to the atlanta marriott perimeter center for which we received the cash proceeds in 2007 but pending the resolution of certain contingencies was not recognized until 2013 typically gains from the disposition of nondepreciable property are included in the determination of adjusted ebitda 73    the following table provides a reconciliation of net income to adjusted

2  net income ebitda adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and adjusted ffo include a gain of 3 million for the year ended december 31 2014 for the sale of the portion of land attributable to individual units sold by the maui timeshare joint venture these metrics also include a gain of 21 million for the year ended december 31 2013 for the sale of excess land adjacent to our newport beach marriott hotel amp spa      3  reflects the sale of an 89 controlling interest in one hotel in 2014 the sale of four hotels in 2014 and the sale of five hotels in 2013      4  during the first quarter of 2013 we recognized a previously deferred gain of approximately 11 million related to the eminent domain claim by the state of georgia for 29 acres of land at the atlanta marriott perimeter center for highway expansion for which we received cash proceeds in 2007 we have included the gain in nareit ffo per diluted share which is consistent with the treatment of gains recognized on the disposition of nondepreciated assets however due to the significant passage of time since we received the proceeds we have excluded the gain from adjusted ffo per diluted share and adjusted ebitda for 2013      5  we exclude the net effect of litigation recoveriesgains or losses that we consider outside of the ordinary course of business from our determination of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ffo for 2014 and 2013 the amounts primarily reflect activity for the litigation concerning the ground lease for the san antonio marriott rivercenter started in 2005 over time we had accrued litigation losses totaling 69 million including 8 million accrued in 2013 for this litigation on october 3 2014 the final motion for rehearing by keystonetexas property holding corporation to the texas supreme court was denied as a result in the third quarter of 2014 we reversed the 69 million loss contingency which is included as a reduction to corporate expense in net income consistent with our definition of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ffo we have excluded 59 million of the gain as the related accrual for this amount was similarly excluded in prior years we are including 10 million of the gain in adjusted ebitda and adjusted ffo which represents periodic interest accrued on the judgments since 2010 as this amount was included as a reduction in adjusted ebitda and adjusted ffo in prior years see part i item 3 legal proceedings for more information on the resolution of this case      6  an adjustment of 15 million is included for the year ended december 31 2013 for our portion of the noncash impairment charges related to one of the hotels in our joint venture in europe the impairment charge has no effect on adjusted ebitda nareit ffo or adjusted ffo nareit ffo nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share we present nareit ffo and nareit ffo per diluted share as nongaap measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share as our nareit ffo defined as set forth below for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with nareit guidelines nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains losses from sales of real estate the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles real estaterelated depreciation amortization and impairments and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the ffo of those entities on the same basis  we believe that nareit ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of nareit ffo per diluted share when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairments and gains and losses from sales of real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other  74    reits even though nareit ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as noted by nareit in its april 2002 white paper on funds from operations since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves for these reasons nareit adopted the ffo metric in order to promote an industrywide measure of reit operating performance  we also present adjusted ffo per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs we believe that the presentation of adjusted ffo per diluted share when combined with both the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share and ffo per diluted share as defined by nareit provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investors complete understanding of our operating performance we adjust nareit ffo per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as adjusted ffo per diluted share        gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period we also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock we believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs        acquisition costs under gaap costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company        litigation gains and losses  we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance  in unusual circumstances we also may adjust nareit ffo for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance for example in the first quarter of 2013 management excluded the 11 million gain from the eminent domain claim for land adjacent to the atlanta marriott perimeter center for which we received the cash proceeds in 2007 but pending the resolution of certain contingencies was not recognized until 2013 typically gains from the disposition of nondepreciable property are included in the determination of nareit and adjusted ffo  75    the following table provides a reconciliation of net income to

property level operating results we present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses ebitda and ebitda margin on a comparable hotel or same store basis as supplemental information for investors our comparable hotel results present operating results for hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions significant property damage or large scale capital improvements during these periods we present comparable hotel ebitda to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable properties after removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and its asset base primarily depreciation and amortization other corporatelevel costs and expenses are also removed to arrive at propertylevel results we believe these propertylevel results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels we eliminate depreciation and amortization because even though depreciation and amortization are propertylevel expenses these noncash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves  as a result of the elimination of corporatelevel costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance  we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the periodtoperiod performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners in particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues andor expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of these hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results for these reasons we believe that comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management  77    the following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our comparable

principles of consolidation  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of host inc host lp and their subsidiaries and controlled affiliates including joint ventures and partnerships we consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability to control the entity for the majority of our hotel and real estate investments we consider those control rights to be i approval or  99  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements   amendment of developments plans ii financing decisions iii approval or amendments of operating budgets and iv investment strategy decisions for those partnerships and joint ventures where we are the general partner we review the rights of the limited partners to determine if those rights would overcome the presumption of control as the general partner limited partner rights which would overcome presumption of control by the general partner include the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause and substantive participating rights over activities considered most significant to the business of the partnership or joint venture primarily voting rights  we also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they are variable interest entities vies if a subsidiary is a vie it is subject to the consolidation framework specifically for vies typically the entity that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance would consolidate the vie we consider an entity a vie if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support we review our subsidiaries and affiliates at least annually to determine if i they should be considered vies and ii whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in the characteristics of these entities  use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates  cash and cash equivalents  we consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents  restricted cash  restricted cash includes reserves for debt service real estate taxes insurance and furniture fixtures and equipment replacement as well as cash collateral and excess cash flow deposits due to mortgage debt agreement restrictions and provisions and a reserve required for potential legal damages for purposes of the statements of cash flows changes in restricted cash caused by changes in required legal reserves are shown as operating activities changes in restricted cash caused by using such funds for furniture fixtures and equipment replacement are shown as investing activities the remaining changes in restricted cash are the direct result of restrictions under our loan agreements and are reflected in cash flows from financing activities  property and equipment  generally property and equipment is recorded at cost for properties we develop cost includes interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction for property and equipment acquired in a business combination we record the assets based on their fair value as of the acquisition date replacements and improvements and capital leases are capitalized while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred we depreciate our property and equipment using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets  we capitalize certain inventory such as china glass silver and linen at the time of a hotel opening or acquisition or when significant inventory is purchased in conjunction with a major rooms renovation or when the number of rooms or meeting space at a hotel is expanded these amounts are then amortized over the estimated useful life of three years subsequent replacement purchases are expensed when placed in service  we maintain a furniture fixtures and equipment replacement fund for renewal and replacement capital expenditures at certain hotels which generally is funded with 5 of property revenues  impairment testing we analyze our consolidated properties for impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we consider a property to be impaired when the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset we test for impairment in several situations including when a property has a current or projected loss from operations when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when other events trends contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and the carrying value of an asset may not be  100  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements   recoverable for impaired assets we record an impairment expense equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value to the extent that a property has a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that it is more likely than not the property will be disposed of prior to the end of its useful life it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the propertys carrying value in the absence of other factors we assume that the estimated life is equal to the gaap depreciable life because of the continuous property maintenance and improvement capital expenditures required under our management agreements we adjust our assumptions with respect to the remaining useful life of the property if situations dictate otherwise such as an expiring ground lease or that it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold prior to its previously expected useful life we also consider the effect of regular renewal and replacement capital expenditures on the estimated life of our properties including critical infrastructure which regularly is maintained and then replaced at the end of its useful life  in the evaluation of the impairment of our assets we make many assumptions and estimates including       projected cash flows both from operations and the eventual disposition       the expected useful life and holding period of the asset        the future required capital expenditures and        fair values including consideration of capitalization rates discount rates and comparable selling prices as well as available thirdparty appraisals  while we consider all of the above indicators as preliminary indicators to determine if the carrying value may not be recovered by undiscounted cash flows we reviewed the actual yeartodate and the projected cash flows from operations in order to identify properties with actual or projected annual operating losses or minimal operating profit as of december 31 2014 the projected cash flows consider items such as booking pace occupancy room rate and propertylevel operating costs as a result of our review we identified two properties that required further consideration of property and market specific conditions or factors to determine if the property was impaired using an undiscounted cash flow analysis management considered a range of revpar and operating margins compared to prior years operating results in evaluating the probabilityweighted projected cash flows from operations to appropriately evaluate if the carrying value of the assets was recoverable we projected cash flows such that the individual properties would return to normalized levels of operations generally within five years and thereafter grow at a stabilized rate of approximately 3 over the remaining estimated lives of the properties this stabilized growth rate is lower than the projected growth rate for the urban upper upscale properties which we believe is most representative of our portfolio over the period from 2013 through 2023 based on this testing none of the properties previously identified required further analysis management believes its assumptions and estimates reflect current market conditions during 2014 2013 and 2012 we recognized impairment expenses of 6 million 1 million and 60 million respectively on one property each year which impairment expenses are included in depreciation and amortization based on changes in estimated holding periods  classification of assets as held for sale we will classify a hotel as held for sale when the sale thereof is probable will be completed within one year and actions to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that the sale will not occur this policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner we typically classify assets as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met       host incs board of directors has approved the sale to the extent that the dollar amount of the sale requires board approval        a binding agreement to sell the property has been signed under which the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and        no significant financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner  if these criteria are met we will cease recording depreciation and will record an impairment expense if the fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount of the hotel we will classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the balance sheet gains on sales of properties are recognized at the time of sale or deferred and recognized as income in subsequent periods as conditions requiring deferral are satisfied or expire without further cost to us  discontinued operations in april 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu 201408 presentation of financial statements topic 205 and property plant and equipment topic 360  reporting discontinued  101  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements   operations and disclosure of disposal of components of an entity asu 201408 reporting for discontinued operations under this standard a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations only if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results in addition it requires an entity to present for each comparative period the assets and liabilities of a disposal group that includes a discontinued operation separately in the asset and liability sections respectively of the statement of financial position as a result the operations through the date of disposal and the gain or loss on sale of properties will be included in continuing operations unless the sale represents a strategic shift we adopted this standard as of january 1 2014 no prior year restatements are permitted for this change in policy  asset retirement obligations we recognize the fair value of any liability for conditional asset retirement obligations including environmental remediation liabilities when incurred which generally is upon acquisition construction or development andor through the normal operation of the asset if sufficient information exists with which to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation  depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets as well as specific market and economic conditions while management believes its estimates are reasonable a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels  intangible assets and liabilities  in conjunction with our acquisitions we may identify intangible assets and liabilities identifiable intangible assets and liabilities typically include contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements which are recorded at fair value these contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the contract intangible assets and liabilities are amortized using the straightline method over the remaining noncancelable term of the related agreements  noncontrolling interests  other consolidated partnerships as of december 31 2014 we consolidate six majorityowned partnerships that have thirdparty noncontrolling ownership interests the thirdparty partnership interests are included in noncontrolling interestother consolidated partnerships on the consolidated balance sheets and totaled 32 million and 34 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively two of the partnerships have finite lives that terminate between 2081 and 2095 and the associated noncontrolling interests are mandatorily redeemable at the end of but not prior to the finite life at december 31 2014 and 2013 the fair values of the noncontrolling interests in the partnerships with finite lives were approximately 85 million and 68 million respectively  net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated partnerships is included in our determination of net income loss net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of third parties is 6 million 4 million and 1 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively  host incs treatment of the noncontrolling interests of host lp host inc adjusts the noncontrolling interests of host lp each period so that the amount presented equals the greater of its carrying value based on its historical cost or its redemption value the historical cost is based on the proportional relationship between the historical cost of equity held by our common stockholders relative to that of the unitholders of host lp the redemption value is based on the amount of cash or host inc stock at our option that would be paid to the noncontrolling interests of host lp if it were terminated we have estimated that the redemption value is equivalent to the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the op units currently owned by unrelated third parties one op unit may be exchanged for 1021494 shares of host inc common stock valued at the market price of host inc common stock at the balance sheet date noncontrolling interests of host lp are classified in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet as they do not meet the requirements for equity classification because the redemption feature requires the delivery of registered shares  102  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements   the table below details the historical cost and redemption values for the noncontrolling interests              as of december 31             2014        2013       op units outstanding

value recorded is equal to the greater of the redemption value or the historical cost  net income loss is allocated to the noncontrolling interests of host lp based on their weighted average ownership percentage during the period net income attributable to host inc has been reduced by the amount attributable to noncontrolling interests in host lp which totaled 9 million 4 million and 1 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively  investments in affiliates  otherthantemporary impairment of an investment we perform an analysis for our equity method investments for impairment based on the occurrence of triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an otherthantemporary basis triggering events can include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment a change in the expected useful life or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel properties therefore generally we will have few observable inputs and will determine fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment as well as consideration of the impact of other elements ie control premiums etc we use certain inputs such as available thirdparty appraisals and forecast net operating income for the hotel properties to estimate the expected cash flows if an equity method investment is impaired and that impairment is determined to be other than temporary an expense is recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the investment no otherthantemporary impairment was recorded in 2014 2013 or 2012 distributions from investments in affiliates we classify the distributions from our equity investments in the statements of cash flows based upon an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances of each distribution for example distributions from cash generated by property operations are classified as cash flows from operating activities however distributions received as a result of property sales are classified as cash flows from investing activities  income taxes  host inc has elected to be treated as a reit effective january 1 1999 pursuant to the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended it is our current intention to adhere to the reit qualification requirements and to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit a corporation that elects reit status and meets certain tax law requirements regarding the distribution of its taxable income to its stockholders as prescribed by applicable tax laws and complies with certain other requirements relating primarily to the composition of its assets and the sources of its revenues generally is not subject to federal and state income taxation on its operating income that is distributed to its stockholders as a partnership for federal income tax purposes host lp is not subject to federal income tax host lp is however subject to state local and foreign income and franchise tax in certain jurisdictions in addition to paying federal and state income tax on any retained income one of our subsidiary reits is subject to a tax on builtin gains on sales of certain assets additionally each of the host lp taxable reit subsidiaries is taxable as a regular c corporation subject to federal state and foreign income tax our consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes the income tax provision or benefit related to the operations of our taxable reit subsidiaries and state local and foreign income and franchise taxes incurred by host lp  deferred tax assets and liabilities under the partnership agreement host lp generally is required to reimburse host inc for any tax payments it is required to make accordingly the tax information included herein represents disclosures regarding host inc and its subsidiaries deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for net operating loss capital loss and tax credit carryovers deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which such amounts are expected to be realized or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted however deferred tax assets are recognized  103  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements   only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies  gaap prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return we must determine whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position once it is determined that a position meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold the position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement in order to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements this accounting standard applies to all tax positions related to income taxes we recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses  deferred charges  financing costs related to longterm debt are deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the debt using the effective interest method  foreign currency translation  as of december 31 2014 our international operations consist of hotels located in australia brazil canada chile mexico and new zealand as well as investments in the euro jv and the asiapacific jv the financial statements of these hotels and our investments therein are maintained in their functional currency which generally is the local currency and their operations are translated to us dollars using the average exchange rates for the period the assets and liabilities of the hotels and the investments therein are translated to us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments are reflected in other comprehensive income loss  foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency for each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at period end exchange rates the resulting exchange differences are recorded in gain loss on foreign currency transactions and derivatives on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations except when recorded in other comprehensive income loss as qualifying net investment hedges  derivative instruments  we are subject to market exposures in several aspects of our business and may enter into derivative instruments in order to hedge the effect of these market exposures on our operations potential market exposures for which we may use derivative instruments to hedge include i changes in the fair value of our international investments due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates ii changes in the fair value of our fixedrate debt due to changes in the underlying interest rates and iii variability in interest payments due to changes in the underlying interest rate for our floatingrate debt derivative instruments are subject to fair value reporting at each reporting date and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income loss or other comprehensive income loss based on the applicable hedge accounting guidance we estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use of third party valuations which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted future expected cash payments prior to entering into the derivative instrument we evaluate whether the transaction will qualify for hedge accounting and continue to evaluate hedge effectiveness throughout the life of the instrument derivative instruments that meet the requirements for hedge accounting are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with offsetting changes recorded to net income loss or other comprehensive income loss based on the applicable hedge accounting guidance we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to reflect as applicable our own nonperformance risk or the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements in adjusting the fair value of our derivative instruments for the effect of nonperformance risk we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings thresholds mutual puts and accumulated guarantees the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves the values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change  104  host hotels amp

present on a net basis excluded from revenues on our statements of operations  fair value measurement in evaluating the fair value of both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities gaap outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market assumptions based on market data observable inputs and a reporting entitys own assumptions about market data unobservable inputs fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date in an orderly transaction an exit price assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy the three levels are as follows  level 1  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date an active market is defined as a market in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing on an ongoing basis  level 2  inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active markets with few transactions inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability ie interest rates yield curves etc and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data correlation or other means  level 3  unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the pricing of an asset or liability when observable inputs are not available  host inc earnings per common share  basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of

transactions over their vesting periods we classify sharebased payment awards granted in exchange for employee services either as equity awards or liability awards based upon cash settlement options equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period awards are classified as liability awards to the extent that settlement features allow the recipient to determine percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet the recipients tax withholding requirements as these awards vest over a oneyear period ending december 31 the value is calculated as the estimated number of shares earned during the year times the stock price at year end less estimated forfeitures for

services concentrations of credit risk  financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents we are exposed

combinations  we recognize identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in a business combination at their fair values at the acquisition date based on the exit price ie the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we evaluate several factors including market data for similar assets expected cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an  107  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements   appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair value of our assets property and equipment are recorded at fair value and such fair value is allocated to buildings improvements furniture fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties acquisitionrelated costs such as due diligence legal and accounting fees are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets  other items that we evaluate in a business combination include identifiable intangible assets capital lease assets and obligations and goodwill identifiable intangible assets typically consist of assumed contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements which are recorded at fair value capital lease obligations that are assumed as part of the acquisition of a leasehold interest are measured at fair value and are included as debt on the accompanying balance sheet and we record the corresponding righttouse assets classification of a lease does not change if it is part of a business combination in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we may utilize a number of sources that arise in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data including thirdparty appraisals and valuations in certain situations a deferred tax liability is recognized due to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the acquired assets at the acquisition date any consideration paid in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired would be recorded to goodwill in very limited circumstances we may record a bargain purchase gain if the consideration paid is less than the net fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired  reclassifications  certain prior year financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform

leverage fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage as defined in our credit facility currently we are permitted to borrow and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 725x our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 175x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 125x the financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility therefore so long as there are no amounts outstanding we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the credit facility in the future if we were to regain compliance with the financial covenants these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period under the terms of the credit facility interest expense excludes items such as gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan in order to establish the debt at fair value and noncash interest expense due to the implementation in 2009 of accounting standards related to our exchangeable debentures all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations additionally total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a net debt concept under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of 100 million are deducted from our total debt balance as of december 31 2014 we are in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit facility  collateral and guarantees the credit facility initially does not include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests in our subsidiaries and the guarantees and pledges are required only in the event that host lps leverage ratio exceeds 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered the guarantees and pledges ratably would benefit the credit facility as well as the notes outstanding under host lps senior notes indenture interest rate and currency hedges and certain other hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility even when triggered the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain us and canadian subsidiaries of host lp and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would provide neither guarantees nor pledges of equity interests as of december 31 2014 our leverage ratio was 26x  interest and fees we pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to libor plus a margin ranging from 875 to 155 basis points depending on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating we also pay a facility fee ranging from 125 to 30 basis points depending on our rating and regardless of usage based on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating as of december 31 2014 we are able to borrow at a rate of libor plus 100 basis points and pay a facility fee of 20 basis points interest on the term loan consists of floating rates plus a margin ranging from 90 to 175 basis points depending on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating based on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating at december 31 2014 the margin is 1125 basis points for an allin interest rate of 129  other covenants and events of default the credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters certain covenants become less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below 60x in particular at any time that our leverage ratio is below 60x we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures and the limitations on acquisitions investments and dividends contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture additionally the credit facilitys restrictions on the incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends generally are consistent with our senior notes indenture for our series d senior notes these provisions under certain circumstances limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain host incs tax status as a reit our senior notes and credit facility have cross default provisions that would trigger a default under those agreements if we were to have a payment default or an acceleration prior to maturity of other debt of host lp or its subsidiaries the amount of other debt in default needs to exceed certain thresholds in order to trigger a cross default and the thresholds are greater for secured debt than for unsecured debt the credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature and provides that upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default payment of all amounts owed under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders commitments may be terminated in addition upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default all amounts owed under the credit facility will become due and payable and the lenders commitments will terminate  114  host hotels amp

and the employee stock purchase plan espp at december 31 2014 there were approximately 17 million shares of host incs common stock reserved and available for issuance under the 2009 comprehensive plan  we recognize costs resulting from sharebased payments in our financial statements over their vesting periods no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite services we classify sharebased payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity or liability awards equity awards are measured based on their fair value as of the date of grant in contrast liability awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period  during 2014 2013 and 2012 we recorded stockbased compensation expense of approximately 22 million 18 million and 16 million respectively shares granted in 2014 2013 and 2012 totaled 20 million 22 million and 18 million respectively while 13 million 12 million and 09 million shares respectively vested during those years  senior executive plan  during 2014 host inc granted 15 million shares of restricted stock awards and 04 million shares of stock option awards to senior executives the annual plan which amount represents the maximum number of shares that can be earned during the year if performance is at the high level of achievement the stock option awards have an exercise price of 1957 per share for performance year 2014 the restricted stock awards and stock option awards vest on an annual basis therefore no awards were outstanding at december 31 2014  restricted stock awards  vesting of restricted stock awards is based on 1 the achievement of relative total shareholder return tsr and 2 the company and personal performance of employees attributable to specific management business objectives approximately 50 of the restricted stock awards are based on the satisfaction of the tsr compared to i the nareit index ii the standard amp poors index and iii a selected lodging company index that serves as a relevant industryasset specific measurement to our competitors with the remaining 50 based on the achievement of management business objectives restricted stock awards granted to us senior executives are classified as liability awards due to settlement features that allow the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax requirements in excess of the statutory minimum withholding requirements the fair value of these shares is adjusted at each balance sheet date and at year end is equal to the number of shares earned during the year at the december 31 2014 stock price of the awards granted in 2014 94 were classified as liability awards in contrast restricted stock awards granted to senior executives operating out of our international offices do not have this settlement feature and are considered equity awards the fair value of these equity awards is based on the fair value on the grant date and is not adjusted for

interest rates and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited and our expected dividend yield to calculate the fair value of stock option awards granted from 2012 to 2014 we assumed i a

third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements with some of our hotels also being subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operation under the designated brand the hotel brands of three of our managers marriott starwood and hyatt represent 56 25 and 12 of our total revenues respectively under these agreements the managers generally have sole responsibility for all activities necessary for the daytoday operation of the hotels including establishing room rates processing reservations and promoting and publicizing the hotels the managers also provide all employees for the hotels prepare reports budgets and projections and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels for the majority of our properties we have approval rights over budgets capital expenditures significant leases and contractual commitments and various other matters  the initial term of our agreements generally is 15 to 25 years with one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager the majority of our agreements condition the managers right to exercise options for renewal upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria the manager typically receives a base management fee which is calculated as a percentage generally 23 of annual gross revenues and an incentive management fee which typically is calculated as a percentage generally 1020 of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the base management fee only is 1 of annual gross revenues but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable to starwood under a separate license agreement pertaining to the designated brand including rights to use trademarks service marks and logos matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services under the license agreement starwood generally receives 5 of gross revenues attributable to room sales and 2 of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales in addition to a base management fee  as part of the agreements the manager furnishes the hotels with certain chain services which generally are provided on a central or regional basis to all hotels in the managers hotel system chain services include central training advertising and promotion national reservation systems computerized payroll and accounting services and such additional services as needed which may be more efficiently performed on a centralized basis costs and expenses incurred in providing such services are allocated among the hotels managed owned or leased by the manager on a fair and equitable basis in addition our managers generally will sponsor a guest rewards program the costs of which will be charged to all of the hotels that participate in such program  we are obligated to provide the manager with sufficient funds generally 5 of the revenue generated at the hotel to cover the cost of a certain nonroutine repairs and maintenance to the hotels which normally are capitalized and b replacements and renewals to the hotels furniture fixtures and equipment under certain circumstances we will be required to establish escrow accounts for such purposes under terms outlined in the agreements  128  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements   we generally are limited in our ability to sell lease or otherwise transfer the hotels unless the transferee assumes the related management agreement however most agreements include owner rights to terminate the agreements on the basis of the managers failure to meet certain performancebased metrics typically these criteria are subject to the managers ability to cure and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts or in some instances waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees  in addition to any performancebased or other termination rights we have negotiated with marriott starwood and some of our other managers specific termination rights related to specific agreements these termination rights can take a number of different forms including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation as well as termination without sale or other condition which may require the payment of a fee these termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by ebitda require that a certain number of properties continue to maintain the brand affiliation or be restricted to a specific pool of assets      14  geographic and business segment information  we consider each one of our hotels to be an operating segment none of which meets the threshold for a reportable segment we also allocate resources and assess operating performance based on individual hotels all of our other real estate investment activities primarily our office buildings are immaterial and with our operating segments meet the aggregation criteria and thus we report one segment hotel ownership our international operations consist of hotels in six countries there were no intersegment sales during the periods presented the following table

   11588            15  guarantees and contingencies  we have certain guarantees which consist of commitments made to third parties for leases or debt that are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements due to various dispositions spinoffs and contractual arrangements but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including the default by an unrelated party we also may have contingent environmental liabilities related to the presence of hazardous or toxic substances we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees and contingencies to be remote the guarantees and contingencies that are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements are listed below        we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested nonlodging properties these primarily represent certain restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately 13 million as of december 31 2014        in connection with the sale of two hotels in january 2005 we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases the future minimum lease payments are approximately 12 million through the full term of the leases including renewal options we believe that the likelihood of any material payments related to these ground leases is remote and in each case we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel  129  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements   guarantees and environmental liabilities that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include       in connection with the sale of the atlanta marriott marquis in january 2013 we retained 5 million of contingent liabilities related to potential environmental liabilities        in connection with the sale of the ritzcarlton san francisco hotel in june 2013 we agreed to guarantee the hotels operating income through december 31 2016 during this period we will make support payments of up to 4 million a year not to exceed 11 million for the life of the agreement in 2014 we recognized approximately 3 million on the deferred gain as of december 31 2014 we have accrued 8 million for the guarantee       16  legal proceedings  we are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business regarding the operation of our hotels and company matters to the extent not covered by insurance these lawsuits generally fall into the following broad categories disputes involving hotellevel contracts employment litigation compliance with laws such as the americans with disabilities act tax disputes and other general matters under our management agreements our operators have broad latitude to resolve individual hotellevel claims for amounts generally less than 150000 however for matters exceeding such threshold our operators may not settle claims without our consent  based on our analysis of legal proceedings with which we currently are involved or of which we are aware and our experience in resolving similar claims in the past we have accrued approximately 35 million as of december 31 2014 we have estimated that in the aggregate our losses related to these proceedings could be as much as 57 million we believe this range represents the maximum potential loss for all of our legal proceedings we are not aware of any other matters with a reasonably possible unfavorable outcome for which disclosure of a loss contingency is required no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings  san antonio litigation in 2005 we initiated a lawsuit against keystonetexas property holding corporation keystone seeking a declaration that a provision of the ground lease for the property under the san antonio marriott rivercenter was valid and claiming that keystone had breached that lease provision keystone filed an amended counterclaim and later a third party claim alleging that we had tortiously interfered with keystones attempted sale of the property and that we slandered keystones title to the property  in 2010 we received an adverse jury verdict in the 166th judicial district court of bexar county texas the jury found that we tortiously interfered with the attempted sale by keystone of the land under the san antonio marriott rivercenter and awarded keystone 343 million in damages plus statutory interest in addition the jury found that we slandered keystones title to the property and awarded keystone 39 million in damages plus statutory interest keystone was only entitled to receive one of these damage awards the jury also awarded keystone 75 million in exemplary damages with respect to the second claim in 2011 a threejudge panel of the san antonio court of appeals issued its memorandum opinion denying our appeal of the trial courts final judgment  in 2012 we filed a petition for review in the texas supreme court on june 13 2014 the texas supreme court reversed the court of appeals judgment and host was no longer liable for the jury verdict and punitive damages award keystone requested a rehearing of the texas supreme courts decision but that motion was denied on october 3 2014 finalizing the texas supreme courts decision as a result in the third quarter of 2014 we reversed the 69 million loss contingency previously recorded related to this litigation and the initial adverse verdict in addition a courtordered bond of 25 million was released on october 17 2014    130  host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements       17  quarterly financial data
