jv expired in march 2012 we did not extend the commitment period beyond the expiration date however as we continue to invest in asia we may offer gic re opportunities to participate in certain acquisitions through the joint venture or a separate joint venture  as of december 31 2012 the asiapacific jv partners have invested approximately 65 million of which our share was 16 million in a joint venture in india with accor sa and interglobe enterprises limited in which the asiapacific jv holds a 36 interest the joint venture in india is developing seven properties in india totaling approximately 1750 rooms two of which opened in bangalore in 2012 and five of which are under various stages of development in chennai and delhi the hotels will be managed by accor under the pullman

million the asiapacific jv invested approximately a17 million 18 million to upgrade and rebrand the hotel as a four points by sheraton we have contributed a10 million 11 million to the asiapacific jv in connection with this acquisition on august 10 2012 the asiapacific jv entered into a a305 million 32 million mortgage loan with commonwealth bank of australia that is secured by the four points by

credit facility    74    table of contents maui joint venture on november 9 2012 we entered into a joint venture with hyatt residential group the maui jv to develop sell and operate a 131unit vacation ownership project in maui hawaii adjacent to our hyatt regency maui resort amp spa we have a 67 ownership interest in the maui jv which is a noncontrolling interest as a result of the significant economic rights held by the hyatt member who also is the managing member the total estimated development costs are 200 million which we expect will be funded with a 110 million construction loan and member contributions we anticipate that hosts investment in the maui jv will be approximately 80 million the joint venture has secured the 110 million construction loan which is jointly and severally guaranteed by both partners as of december 31 2012 we have contributed land valued at 36 million and approximately 8 million in preformation expenditures as of december 31 2012 the book value of our investment in the maui jv is 15 million which represents our portion of the historical cost basis of the land plus the preformation expenditures during 2012 we recognized a gain on the sale of the land to the maui jv of approximately 8 million construction has begun and the project is expected to open in late 2014  hyatt place joint venture in may 2012 we entered into a joint venture agreement in which we are a 50 partner with white lodging services to develop the 255room hyatt place in downtown nashville tennessee for approximately 46 million including the purchase of the land the joint venture has secured a 348 million construction loan for this project but as of december 31 2012 had not drawn on this facility along with white lodging services we have jointly and severally guaranteed the payment of the loan we have invested approximately 5 million for our investment in the joint venture due to the significant control rights of our partner we will not consolidate the joint venture in our financial statements  tax sharing arrangements under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies such as marriott international inc hms host and barceló crestline corporation we are obligated to pay certain taxes federal state local and foreign including any related interest and penalties relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us for example a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us this adjustment could produce a tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement additionally under the partnership agreement between host inc and host lp host lp is obligated to pay certain taxes federal state local and foreign including any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc as well as any liabilities the irs may successfully assert against host inc we do not expect any amounts paid under these tax sharing arrangements to be material  tax indemnification agreements as a result of certain federal and state income tax considerations of the former owners of two hotels currently owned by host lp we have agreed to restrictions on selling such hotels or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods one of these agreements expires in 2028 and the other in 2031  guarantees we have certain guarantees which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt that are not recorded on our books due to various dispositions spinoffs and contractual arrangements but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote the largest guarantees by dollar amount are listed below            we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested nonlodging properties these primarily represent certain restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately 21 million as of december 31 2012            in 1997 we owned leisure park venture limited partnership which currently owns and operates a senior living facility we no longer have an ownership interest in the partnership but remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with respect to 147 million of municipal bonds issued by the new jersey economic development authority through their maturity in 2027 however to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee we have been indemnified by barceló crestline corporation who in turn is indemnified by the current owner of the facility    75    table of contents         in connection with the sale of two hotels in january 2005 we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases the future minimum lease payments are approximately 12 million through the full term of the leases including renewal options we believe that the likelihood of any liability arising related to these ground leases is remote and in each case we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel            in connection with the sale of the atlanta marriott marquis in january 2013 we retained 5 million of contingent liabilities related to potential

                        1 the amounts shown include amortization of principal debt maturities and estimated interest payments interest payments have been included in this category based on the weighted average interest rate    2 our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels under our contracts we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years    3 the amounts shown include deferred management fees and the estimated amount of tax expense under terms of our management agreements we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owners priority to us the timing of the payments if any is based on future operations the termination of the management agreement or the sale of the hotel and is therefore not determinable the estimated amount of tax expense relates to uncertain tax liabilities from prior years  critical accounting policies  our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates we evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to the impairment of longlived assets on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates  hotels acquired in a business combination we record our investments in hotel properties based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition date property and equipment are recorded at fair value and allocated to buildings improvements furniture fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties fair values are based on the exit price ie the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we evaluate several factors including market data for similar assets expected cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair value of our assets    76    table of contents other items that we evaluate in a business combination include identifiable intangible assets capital lease assets and obligations and goodwill identifiable intangible assets are typically assumed contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements which are recorded at fair value abovemarket and belowmarket contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the contract intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the remaining noncancelable term of the related agreements capital lease obligations that are assumed as part of the acquisition of a leasehold interest are measured at fair value and included as debt on the accompanying balance sheet and we record the corresponding righttouse assets classification of a lease does not change if it is part of a business combination in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data including thirdparty appraisals and valuations in certain situations a deferred tax liability may be created due to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the asset at the acquisition date any consideration paid in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired would be recorded to goodwill in very limited circumstances we may record a bargain purchase gain if the consideration paid is less than the net fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired furthermore acquisitionrelated costs such as due diligence legal and accounting fees are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets  impairment testing we analyze our assets for impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying values thereof may not be recoverable we consider a property to be impaired when the sum of future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset for impaired assets we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the propertys carrying value over its fair value to the extent that a property has a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that it is more likely than not the property will be disposed of prior to the end of its useful life it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the propertys carrying value in the absence of other factors we assume that the estimated life is equal to the gaap depreciable life because of the continuous property maintenance and improvement capital expenditures required under our management agreements we adjust our assumptions with respect to the remaining useful life of the property if situations dictate otherwise such as an expiring ground lease or it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold prior to its previously expected useful life we also consider the effect of regular renewal and replacement capital expenditures on the estimable life of our properties including critical infrastructure which is regularly maintained and then replaced at the end of its useful life  we test for impairment in several situations including when a property has a current or projected loss from operations when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when other events trends contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in the evaluation of the impairment of our assets we make many assumptions and estimates including            projected cash flows both from operations and the eventual disposition            expected useful life and holding period            future required capital expenditures and            fair values including consideration of capitalization rates discount rates and comparable selling prices  while we consider all of the above indicators as a preliminary indicator to determine if the carrying value may not be recovered by undiscounted cash flows we reviewed the actual yeartodate and the projected cash flows from operations to identify properties with actual or projected annual operating losses or minimal operating profit as of december 31 2012 the projected cash flows consider items such as booking pace occupancy room rate and propertylevel operating costs as a result of our review we identified five properties that required further consideration of property and market specific conditions or factors to determine if the property was impaired using an undiscounted cash flow analysis management considered a range of revpar and operating margins compared to prior years operating results in evaluating the probabilityweighted projected cash flows from operations to appropriately evaluate if the carrying value of the assets was recoverable we projected cash flows such that the    77    table of contents  individual properties would return to normalized levels of operations generally within five years and thereafter grow at a stabilized rate of approximately 3 over the remaining estimable lives of the properties this stabilized growth rate is lower than the projected growth rate for the urban upper upscale properties which we believe is most representative of our portfolio over the period from 2012 through 2022 based on this test one property exhibited an impaired value at december 31 2012 for purposes of this test if we had assumed a growth rate of 50 basis points lower after the return to normalized levels of operations none of the other four properties identified above would have required further analysis management believes its assumptions and estimates reflect current market conditions we recognized impairment expense in the aggregate amount of 60 million and 8 million for 2012 and 2011 respectively based on a change in their estimated hold periods  otherthantemporary impairment of an investment we review our equity method investments for otherthantemporary impairment based on the occurrence of any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an otherthantemporary basis triggering events can include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment a change in the expected hold period or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel properties therefore we generally will have few observable inputs and will determine the fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment as well as considering the impact of other elements ie control premiums etc we use certain inputs such as available thirdparty appraisals and forecast net operating income for the hotel properties to estimate the expected cash flows if an equity method investment is impaired a loss is recorded for the difference between its fair value and its carrying value based on this test no otherthantemporary impairment was recorded in 2012  classification of assets as held for sale our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale of the asset is probable prior to classifying it as such will be completed within one year and that actions required to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that it is unlikely the planned sale will not occur this policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner specifically we typically will classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met            host incs board of directors has approved the sale to the extent that the dollar amount of the sale requires board approval            a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed            the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and            no significant contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner  to the extent that a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property we will record an impairment loss  depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets as well as specific market and economic conditions while management believes its estimates are reasonable a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels  valuation of deferred tax assets we have approximately 90 million net of a valuation allowance of 63 million of deferred tax assets as of december 31 2012 the objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a companys financial statements or tax returns we have considered various factors including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation    78    table of contents  allowance for our deferred tax assets and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the 90 million of net deferred tax assets in the future when a determination is made that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period  valuation of derivative contracts we occasionally will enter into derivative products including interest rate and foreign currency swaps caps and collars derivative instruments are subject to fair value reporting at each reporting date and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income loss or accumulated other comprehensive income loss based on the applicable hedge accounting guidance we estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use of third party valuations which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted future expected cash payments we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings thresholds mutual puts and guarantees the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves the values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations the fair value of our derivatives is likely to fluctuate from yeartoyear based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity  stock compensation we recognize costs resulting from host incs sharebased payment transactions over their vesting periods we classify sharebased payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity awards or liability awards the classification of host incs restricted stock awards as either an equity award or a liability award is based upon cash settlement options equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period awards are classified as liability awards to the extent that settlement features allow the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax withholding requirements the value of these restricted stock awards less estimated forfeitures is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  the requisite service period usually the vesting period no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite services  on january 20 2012 the compensation policy committee of the board of directors adopted a new compensation plan for senior management the 2012 plan that replaces the expired 2009 compensation program components of the 2012 plan include the following awards            restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions these awards vest based on the total shareholder return tsr relative to i the nareit index ii the sampp index and iii a selected lodging company index that serves as a relevant industryasset specific measurement to our competitors us based senior management may elect to have amounts withheld for taxes in excess of minimum statutory tax requirements and as result tsr awards granted to these employees are classified as liability awards and are remeasured to fair value each reporting period in contrast senior management located outside of the us are limited as to the amount of shares they may use for statutory tax requirements and as result tsr awards granted to these employees are classified as equity awards and are recorded at fair value as of the grant date the valuation of these awards is a custom calculation that is based on common valuation techniques such as the lattice binomial and blackscholes valuation methodologies the utilization of this model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of host incs common stock riskfree interest rates actual tsr from the beginning of the performance period through the measurement date host incs stock beta as compared to the risk to the average risk of the peer groups            restricted stock awards with vesting based on performance conditions these awards are earned based on the employee achieving a specified performance target which will be based on the employees specific management business objectives compensation cost will be recognized when the achievement of the performance condition is considered probable if a performance condition has more than one outcome that is probable recognition of compensation cost will be based on the condition that is the most likely outcome for us based senior management these awards are classified as liability awards due to their cash settlement provisions therefore the value of the shares to be issued by host inc will be based on host incs share price on the reporting date            stock option awards the stock option awards are equity classified awards as they do not include cash settlement features therefore the value of the award is determined on the grant date using a binomial pricing model and is not adjusted for future changes in fair value vesting for these awards is based on service conditions the utilization of the binomial model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock riskfree interest rates and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited and our expected dividend yield    79    table of contents on january 20 2012 host inc granted senior management 16 million restricted shares for performance year 2012 which represent the maximum number of shares that can be earned during the year if performance is at the high level of achievement vesting of these shares is subject to meeting the performance measures outlined above approximately 50 of the restricted shares granted are marketbased with the remaining performancebased in addition the company awarded approximately 02 million stock options with an exercise price of 1623 per share for performance year 2012 during 2012 we recorded approximately 16 million of stock compensation expense associated with the 2012 grant  consolidation policies judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in terms of the evaluation of control including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests we consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the subsidiary for the majority of our hotel and real estate investments we consider those rights to be i approval or amendment of developments plans ii financing decisions iii approval or amendments of operating budgets and iv investment strategy decisions for those partnerships and joint ventures of which we are the general partner we review the rights of the limited partners to determine if those rights would preclude the presumption of control as the general partner limited partner rights which would preclude presumption of control by the general partner include the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the limited partnership or otherwise remove us as the general partner without cause and substantive participating rights primarily through voting rights  we also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they should be considered variable interest entities vies if a subsidiary is a vie it is subject to the consolidation framework specifically for vies we consider an entity a vie if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support we review our subsidiaries and affiliates annually to determine if i they should be considered vies and ii whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in their characteristics  foreign currency translation the operations of international subsidiaries are maintained in their functional currency which generally is the local currency and are translated to us dollars using the average exchange rates for the period the assets and liabilities are translated to us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency of each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at period end exchange rates the resulting exchange differences are recorded in gain loss on foreign currency transactions and derivatives except when deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as qualifying net investment hedges  comparable hotel operating statistics  to facilitate a yeartoyear comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics ie revpar average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues expenses adjusted operating profit and associated margins for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis because these statistics and operating results are for our hotel properties they exclude results for our nonhotel properties and other real estate investments we define our comparable hotels as properties        i that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and        ii that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone largescale capital projects as further defined below during the reporting periods being compared    80    table of contents the hotel business is capitalintensive and renovations are a regular part of the business generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels a large scale capital project that would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set is an extensive renovation of several core aspects of the hotel such as rooms meeting space lobby bars restaurants and other public spaces both quantitative and qualitative factors are taken into consideration in determining if the renovation would cause a hotel to be removed from the comparable hotel set including unusual or exceptional circumstances such as a reduction or increase in room count rebranding a significant alteration of the business operations or the closing of the hotel during the renovation  we do not include an acquired hotel in our comparable hotel set until the operating results for that hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year for example we acquired the westin chicago river north in august of 2010 the hotel was not included in our comparable hotels until january 1 2012 hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption or commence a largescale capital project in each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after completion of the repair of the property damage or cessation of the business interruption or the completion of largescale capital projects as applicable  of the 119 hotels we owned on december 31 2012 103 have been classified as comparable hotels the operating results of the following hotels that we owned or leased as of december 31 2012 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods            grand hyatt washington acquired in july 2012            hilton melbourne south wharf acquired in april 2011            the westin new york grand central acquired in march 2011

we disposed of in 2012 and 2011 as well as the 53 courtyard by marriott properties previously leased from hpt are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein    81    table of contents we evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both geographic region and property type these divisions are generally consistent with groupings recognized in the lodging industry  geographic regions consist of the following only states in which we own hotels are listed            pacific  california hawaii oregon and washington            mountain  arizona

florida hawaii and southern california and            airport  hotels located at or near airports  reporting periods effective january 1 2013 marriott announced that it will convert from a 5253 week fiscal year to a 12month calendar year while our annual financial statements have always been reported on a calendar basis and are unaffected by this change our quarterly results have not been on a 3month calendar quarter basis as they followed marriotts period schedule however beginning with the first quarter of 2013 we will report annual and quarterly operating results on a calendar reporting cycle which is consistent with the majority of companies in the lodging industry we will not restate any previously reported quarterly financial statements to conform to the new presentation accordingly investors may find the following discussion useful when evaluating quarterly operations in 2013 with prior year quarterly results for both financial statement presentation and hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results  for consolidated statement of operations the results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers our hotel managers use different reporting periods marriott international inc the manager of a significant percentage of our properties prior to january 1 2013 used a fiscal year ending on the friday closest to december 31 and reported twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its us and canadian marriottmanaged hotels in contrast other managers of our hotels such as hyatt and starwood report results on a monthly basis host inc as a reit is required by federal income tax law to report results on a calendar year basis as a result we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by marriott modified so that our fiscal year always ends on december 31 in order to comply with reit rules our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as marriott but our fourth quarter ends on december 31 and our full year results as reported in our statement of operations always includes the same number of days as the calendar year    82    table of contents two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted for periods prior to january 1 2013 are 1 quarterly start dates will usually differ between years except for the first quarter which always commences on january 1 and 2 our first and fourth quarters of operations and yeartodate operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years for example set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for 2012 and 2011 note that the second and third quarters of each year both reflect twelve weeks of operations in contrast the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations                     2012    2011       startend dates   no of days    startend dates   no of days   first quarter   january 1  march

september 8  december 31   115   september 10  december 31   113  while the reporting calendar we adopted for periods prior to january 1 2013 is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by marriott another consequence of our calendar is that we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarterend until the following quarter because our hotel managers that use a monthly reporting period do not make midmonth results available to us hence the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarterend is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following quarter for those hotel managers covering approximately 48 of total revenues of our hotels as a result our quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows first quarter january february second quarter march to may third quarter june to august and fourth quarter september to december while this does not affect full year results it does affect the reporting of quarterly results for years prior to 2013  for hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results in contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statement of operations our 2011 and 2012 hotel operating statistics ie revpar average daily rate and average occupancy and our 2011 and 2012 comparable hotel results are reported based on the reporting cycle used by marriott in those years for our marriottmanaged hotels this facilitates yeartoyear comparisons as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year this means however that the reporting periods we used for hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results for 2012 and 2011 will differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates that are used for our hotel

nongaap financial measures  we use certain nongaap financial measures which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap within the meaning of applicable sec rules these measures are as follows i ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp ii funds from operations ffo and ffo per diluted share both nareit and adjusted as a measure of performance for host inc and iii comparable hotel operating results as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp    83    table of contents we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the nareit definition of ffo or do not calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance in addition although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to nonreits we also calculate adjusted ffo per diluted share which is not in accordance with nareit guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other reits ebitda and adjusted ebitda as presented may also not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with gaap cash expenditures for various longterm assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures interest expense for ebitda and adjusted ebitda purposes only and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the ebitda adjusted ebitda nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share presentations management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our nongaap financial measures additionally nareit ffo per diluted share adjusted ffo per diluted share ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions in addition nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as a measure of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders benefit the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance  ebitda and adjusted ebitda  ebitda  earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries management believes ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization management also believes the use of ebitda facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits hotel owners who are not reits and other capitalintensive companies management uses ebitda to evaluate propertylevel results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs  adjusted ebitda  historically management has adjusted ebitda when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of adjusted ebitda when combined with the primary gaap presentation of net income is beneficial to an investors complete understanding of our operating performance adjusted ebitda is also a relevant measure in calculating certain credit ratios we adjust ebitda for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as adjusted ebitda            real estate transactions  we exclude the effect of gains and losses including the amortization of deferred gains recorded on the disposition or acquisition of depreciable assets and property insurance gains in our consolidated statement of operations because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets in addition material gains or losses from the depreciated value of the disposed assets could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset value often does not reflect its market value as noted below for ffo            equity investment adjustments  we exclude the equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated investments in partnerships and joint ventures as presented in our consolidated statement of operations because it includes our pro rata portion of depreciation amortization and interest expense which are    84    table of contents       excluded from ebitda we include our pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our equity investments as we believe this more accurately reflects the performance of our investments the pro rata adjusted ebitda of equity investments is defined as the ebitda of our equity investments adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by our percentage ownership in the partnership or joint venture            consolidated partnership adjustments  we deduct the noncontrolling partners pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our consolidated partnerships as this reflects the noncontrolling owners interest in the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships the pro rata adjusted ebitda of noncontrolling partners is defined as the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by the noncontrolling partners positions in the partnership or joint venture            cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  infrequently the financial accounting standards board fasb promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle we exclude these onetime adjustments because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period            impairment losses  we exclude the effect of impairment losses recorded because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets in addition we believe that impairment charges which are based off of historical cost account values are similar to gains losses on dispositions and depreciation expense both of which are also excluded from ebitda            acquisition costs  under gaap costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company  the following table provides a reconciliation of net income

diluted share we present nareit ffo and nareit ffo per diluted share as nongaap measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share as our nareit ffo defined as set forth below for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with nareit guidelines nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains losses from sales of real estate the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles real estaterelated depreciation amortization and impairments and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata ffo of those entities on the same basis  we believe that nareit ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of nareit ffo per diluted share when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairments and gains and losses from sales of real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other reits even though nareit ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as noted by nareit in its april 2002 white paper on funds from operations since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves for these reasons nareit adopted the ffo metric in order to promote an industrywide measure of reit operating performance  we also present adjusted ffo per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs we believe that the presentation of adjusted ffo per diluted share when combined with both the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share and ffo per diluted share as defined by nareit provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investors complete understanding of our operating performance we adjust nareit ffo per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as adjusted ffo per diluted share            gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired we also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock we believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs            acquisition costs  under gaap costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company            litigation gains and losses  we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing

without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions significant property damage or large scale capital improvements during these periods we present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporatelevel costs including expenses related to our capital structure as well as depreciation and amortization we eliminate corporatelevel costs and expenses to arrive at property level results because we believe propertylevel results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels we eliminate depreciation and amortization because even though depreciation and amortization are propertylevel expenses these noncash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves  as a result of the elimination of corporatelevel costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance  we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the periodtoperiod performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners in particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues andor expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of these hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based

flow hedges we have designated our floatingtofixed interest rate swap derivatives as cash flow hedges the purpose of the interest rate swaps is to hedge against changes in cash flows interest payments attributable to fluctuations in benchmark interest rates associated with variable rate debt the derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement we also evaluate counterparty credit risk when we calculate the fair value of the swaps changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded to other comprehensive income loss on the accompanying balance

interest rate swap derivatives designated as fair value hedges we have designated our fixedtofloating interest rate swap derivatives as fair value hedges we enter into these derivative instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt that occur as a result of changes in market interest rates the derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement we also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps the change in the fair value of the derivative is offset largely by the corresponding change in the fair value of the underlying debt due to change in the 3month libor rate which is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt any difference between the change in the fair value of the swap and the change in the fair value in the underlying debt which was not significant for the periods presented is considered the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship and is recorded in net income loss  we have three fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount of 300 million during 2012 and 2011 the fair value of the swaps decreased 35 million and increased 03 million respectively as a result we will pay a floating interest rate equal to the 3month libor plus a spread which ranges from 27 to 32 as opposed to the fixed rate of 5531 on the notional amount of 300 million through march 1 2014 during each of 2012 and 2011 the cash settlement received under the swap agreement decreased interest expense by 6 million if we were to increase the interest rates from the prevailing market yield curve which for our reverse swaps is 3month libor by 25 at december 31 2012 then the fair value of the swap would decrease 03 million similarly if we were to decrease the interest rates from the prevailing market yield curve by 25 at december 31 2012 then the fair value of the swap would increase by 03 million  exchange rate

to manage the currency exchange risk applicable to ownership in nonus hotels where possible we may enter into forward or option foreign currency purchase contracts or designate a portion of the foreign currency draws on our credit facility as hedges of net investments in foreign operations the foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into were strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes  as of december 31 2012 we have six foreign currency forward sale contracts that hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in foreign operations these derivatives are considered hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation and are markedtomarket with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss within the equity portion of our balance sheets the forward sale contracts are valued based on the forward yield curve of the foreign currency to us dollar forward exchange rate on the date of measurement pursuant to these contracts we will sell the euro or nz dollar amount as applicable and receive the us dollar amount
