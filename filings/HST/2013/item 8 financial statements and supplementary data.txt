financial statements include the consolidated accounts of host inc host lp and their subsidiaries and controlled affiliates including joint ventures and partnerships we consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity for those partnerships and joint ventures where we are the general partner we review the rights of the limited partners to determine if those rights would overcome the presumption of control as the general partner limited partner rights which would overcome presumption of control by the general partner include the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause and substantive participating rights over activities considered most significant to the business of the partnership or joint venture primarily voting rights  we also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they are variable interest entities vies typically the entity that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance would consolidate the vie we consider an entity a vie if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support we review our subsidiaries at least annually to determine if i they should be considered vies and ii whether we should change our

using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets  we capitalize certain inventory such as china glass silver linen at the time of a hotel opening or acquisition or when significant inventory is purchased in conjunction with a major rooms renovation or when the number of rooms or meeting space at a hotel is expanded these amounts are then amortized over the estimated useful life of three years subsequent replacement purchases are expensed when placed in service    113    table of contents host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued    we maintain a furniture fixtures and equipment replacement fund for renewal and replacement capital expenditures at certain hotels which generally is funded with 5 of property revenues  we analyze our consolidated properties for impairment when events or circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we consider a property to be impaired when the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset we test for impairment in several situations including when a property has a current or projected loss from operations when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when other events trends contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable for impaired assets we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value in the evaluation of the impairment of our assets we make many assumptions and estimates including assumptions of the projected cash flows both from operations and the eventual disposition the expected useful life and holding period of the asset the future required capital expenditures and fair values including consideration of capitalization rates discount rates and comparable selling prices as well as available thirdparty appraisals during 2012 and 2011 we recognized impairment charges of 60 million on one property which is included in depreciation and amortization and 8 million on two properties which is included in discontinued operations respectively based on changes in estimated hold periods  we perform a similar analysis for our equity method investments for impairment based on the occurrence of triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an otherthantemporary basis triggering events can include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment a change in the expected useful life or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel properties therefore we generally will have few observable inputs and will determine fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment as well as consideration of the impact of other elements ie control premiums etc if an equity method investment is impaired and that impairment is determined to be other than temporary a loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment  we will classify a hotel as held for sale when the sale of the asset is probable will be completed within one year and actions to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that the sale will not occur we typically classify assets as held for sale when host incs board of directors has approved the sale a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed under which the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and no significant financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner if these criteria are met we will cease recording depreciation and will record an impairment loss if the fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount of the hotel we will classify the loss together with the related operating results including interest expense on debt assumed by the buyer or that is required to be repaid as a result of the sale as discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of operations and classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the balance sheet gains on sales of properties are recognized at the time of sale or deferred and recognized as income in subsequent periods as conditions requiring deferral are satisfied or expire without further cost to us  we recognize the fair value of any liability for conditional asset retirement obligations including environmental remediation liabilities when incurred which generally is upon acquisition construction or development andor through the normal operation of the asset if sufficient information exists with which to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation  intangible assets  in conjunction with our acquisitions we may identify intangible assets identifiable intangible assets typically include contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements which are recorded at fair value these contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the contract intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the remaining noncancelable term of the related agreements    114    table of contents host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries  notes

338 million of mortgage loans due in 2013 is below levels required by certain debt covenants which have triggered covenant defaults and cash sweeps under the loans these loans are crosscollateralized meaning that a default under one loan could trigger a default on the loans for the other five properties the lenders have granted the euro jv a waiver of the defaults and are currently discussing the terms of a multiyear extension of the maturity of this debt we expect that lenders will require more stringent financial covenants interest rates with higher basis point spreads over libor and lower loantovalue ratios these requirements upon a refinancing or a debt extension transaction likely will require a partial principal reduction via an equity contribution from the partners of the euro jv

of three of our hotel properties two of which have been sold  in evaluating the fair value of both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities gaap outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market assumptions based on market data observable inputs and a reporting entitys own assumptions about market data unobservable inputs the requirements are intended to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and related disclosures fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date in an orderly transaction an exit price assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy the three levels are as follows  level 1  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date an active market is defined as a market in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing on an ongoing basis  level 2  inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active markets with few transactions inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability ie interest rates yield curves etc and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data correlation or other means  level 3  unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the pricing of an asset or liability when observable inputs are not available    140    table of contents host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries

evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are largely offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the underlying debt due to changes in the 3month libor rate which change is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt any difference between the change in the fair value of the swap

to the hotel novotel christchurch cathedral square and the hotel ibis christchurch the ibis reopened in september 2012 and the novotel is expected to reopen mid2013 however the historic portion of the novotel the warners building has been demolished and is not expected to be replaced we believe we have sufficient coverage under the insurance policy of our property manager for both property and business interruption we have recorded a loss of 3 million which represents the estimated deductible under our insurance policy in the second quarter of 2011  we estimated that we incurred approximately 33 million of property damage which amount represents the book value of the properties and equipment written off less any deductible and the related repairs and cleanup costs incurred gains on property insurance proceeds represent proceeds received in excess of the insurance receivable which receivable represents the book value of the damaged assets that were writtenoff any gains resulting from insurance proceeds are not recognized until all contingencies are resolved during 2012 and 2011 we recognized a gain of 9 million and 2 million respectively for the receipt of business interruption insurance proceeds as of december 31 2012 we have agreed upon settlement amounts with our primary insurer for all property and business interruption insurance except for real property damage to the warners building while the primary insurer has recognized its liability with regard to the warners building there is no agreed settlement amounts for real property damage to the warners building as the ground lessor has filed suit to recover a portion of the insurance proceeds from the primary insurer for the hotel while we can provide no assurance as to the timing of when this dispute will be settled we believe that it is more likely than not that we will recover the full value of our insurance receivable in addition we have made a separate claim for reimbursement under our corporate policy though we have not recorded any additional amounts of insurance receivable with regard to this claim we have received 21 million of cash for property insurance and have an outstanding insurance receivable of 11 million which is included in other assets representing the remaining claims for property damage    144    table of contents host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued    14 hotel management agreements and operating and license agreements  all of our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements with some of those hotels also being subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operation under the designated brand the hotel brands of three of our managers marriott starwood and hyatt represent 60 23 and 11 of our total revenues respectively under these agreements the managers generally have sole responsibility for all activities necessary for the daytoday operation of the hotels including establishing room rates processing reservations and promoting and publicizing the hotels the managers also provide all employees for the hotels prepare reports budgets and projections and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels for the majority of our properties we have approval rights over budgets capital expenditures significant leases and contractual commitments and various other matters  the initial term of our agreements generally is 15 to 25 years with one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager the majority of our agreements condition the managers right to exercise options for renewal upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria the manager typically receives a base management fee which is calculated as a percentage generally 23 of annual gross revenues and an incentive management fee which typically is calculated as a percentage generally 1020 of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the base management fee is only 1 of annual gross revenues but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable to starwood under a separate license agreement pertaining to the designated brand including rights to use trademarks service marks and logos matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services under the license agreement starwood generally receives 5 of gross revenues attributable to room sales and 2 of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales in addition to a base management fee  as part of the agreements the manager furnishes the hotels with certain chain services which are generally provided on a central or regional basis to all hotels in the managers hotel system chain services include central training advertising and promotion national reservation systems computerized payroll and accounting services and such additional services as needed which may be more efficiently performed on a centralized basis costs and expenses incurred in providing such services are allocated among the hotels managed owned or leased by the manager on a fair and equitable basis in addition our managers generally will sponsor a guest rewards program the costs of which will be charged to all of the hotels that participate in such program  we are obligated to provide the manager with sufficient funds generally 5 of the revenue generated at the hotel to cover the cost of a certain nonroutine repairs and maintenance to the hotels which are normally capitalized and b replacements and renewals to the hotels furniture fixtures and equipment under certain circumstances we will be required to establish escrow accounts for such purposes under terms outlined in the agreements  we generally are limited in our ability to sell lease or otherwise transfer the hotels unless the transferee assumes the related management agreement however most agreements include owner rights to terminate the agreements on the basis of the managers failure to meet certain performancebased metrics typically these criteria are subject to the managers ability to cure and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts or in some instances waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees  in addition to any performancebased or other termination rights we have negotiated with marriott and starwood specific termination rights related to specific agreements these termination rights can take a number of different forms including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation as well as termination without sale or other condition which may require payment of a fee these termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by ebitda require that a certain number of properties continue to maintain the brand affiliation or be restricted to a specific pool of assets    145    table of contents host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued    15 geographic and

performance based on individual hotels all of our other real estate investment activities primarily our office buildings are immaterial and with our operating segments meet the aggregation criteria

third parties for leases or debt that are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements due to various dispositions spinoffs and contractual arrangements but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including the default by an unrelated party we may also have contingent environmental liabilities related to the presence of hazardous or toxic substances we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees and contingencies to be remote the guarantees and contingencies are listed below            we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested nonlodging properties these primarily represent certain restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately 21 million as of december 31 2012            in 1997 we owned leisure park venture limited partnership which owns and operates a senior living facility we spunoff the partnership to barceló as part of the reit conversion but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with respect to 147 million of municipal bonds issued by the new jersey economic development authority through their maturity in 2027 however to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee we have been indemnified by barceló who in turn is indemnified by the current owner of the facility            in connection with the sale of two hotels in january 2005 we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases the future minimum lease payments are approximately 12 million through the full term of the leases including renewal options we believe that the likelihood of any material payments related to these ground leases is remote and in each case we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel            in connection with the sale of the atlanta marriott marquis in january 2013 we retained 5 million of contingent liabilities related to potential environmental liabilities    146    table of contents host hotels amp resorts inc host hotels amp resorts lp and subsidiaries  notes to

matters to the extent not covered by insurance these lawsuits generally fall into the following broad categories disputes involving hotellevel contracts employment litigation compliance with laws such as the americans with disabilities act tax disputes and other general matters under our management agreements our operators have broad latitude to resolve individual hotellevel claims for amounts generally less than 150000 however for matters exceeding such threshold our operators may not settle claims without our consent  based on our analysis of legal proceedings with which we are currently involved or of which we are aware and our experience in resolving similar claims in the past we have accrued approximately 11 million as of december 31 2012 we have estimated that in the aggregate our losses related to these proceedings could be as much as 53 million we believe this range represents the maximum potential loss for all of our legal proceedings with the exception of the san antonio litigation discussed below we are not aware of any other matters with a reasonably possible unfavorable outcome for which disclosure of a loss contingency is required no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings  san antonio litigation the texas supreme court is currently considering our appeal of an outstanding judgment in favor of keystonetexas property holding corporation keystone the judgment relates to keystones claims arising out of the ground lease for the property under the san antonio marriott rivercenter hotel the judgment consists of i 39 million in

no assurances can be given as to the outcome of this appeal based on the court decisions reached to date we believe our maximum exposure for the keystone litigation is 66 million after consideration
