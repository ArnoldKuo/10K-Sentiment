of contents the lodging industry  the lodging industry in the united states consists of private and public entities that operate in an extremely diversified market under a variety of brand names the lodging industry has several key participants            owners  own the hotel and typically enter into an agreement for an independent third party to manage the hotel these properties may be branded and operated under the managers brand or branded under a franchise agreement and operated by the franchisee or by an independent hotel manager the properties also may be operated as an independent hotel by an independent hotel manager            ownermanagers  own the hotel and operate the property with their own management team these properties may be branded under a franchise agreement operated as an independent hotel or operated under the owners brand we are prohibited from operating and managing hotels under applicable reit rules            franchisors  own a brand or brands and strive to grow their revenues by expanding the number of hotels in their franchise system franchisors provide their hotels with brand recognition marketing support and centralized reservation systems for the franchised hotels            franchisormanagers  own a brand or brands and also operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner or franchisee            managers  operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner but do not themselves own a brand the hotels may be operated under a franchise agreement or as an independent hotel  the hotel manager is responsible for the daytoday operation of the hotel including the employment of hotel staff the determination of room rates the development of sales and marketing plans the preparation of operating and capital expenditure budgets and the preparation of financial reports for the owner they typically receive fees based on the revenues and profitability of the hotel  revenue per available room revpar is an operational measure commonly used in the hotel industry to evaluate hotel performance revpar represents the product of the average daily room rate adr charged and the average daily occupancy achieved but excludes other revenue generated by a hotel property such as food and beverage parking and other revenues adr reflects the average rate charged by hotels average rates can be influenced by among other things demand previously negotiated contracts the overall mix of business and new supply in a given market  our industry is influenced by the cyclical relationship between the supply of and demand for hotel rooms lodging demand growth typically is related to the vitality of the overall economy in addition to local market factors that stimulate travel to specific destinations in particular economic indicators such as gdp growth business investment and employment growth are some of the primary drivers of lodging demand between 2003 and 2007 broad growth in the economy led to increases in demand however the global recession of 2008 through 2009 resulted in a considerable decline in both consumer and business spending and a severe decline in demand within the lodging industry while lodging demand has not recovered fully from the steep declines in those years the gradual recovery that began in 2010 has continued through 2012 led by transient demand from business and leisure travelers we expect demand to continue to improve in 2013 though the rate of growth may be affected by uncertainty in the direction of both the domestic and global economy  lodging supply growth generally is driven by overall lodging demand as extended periods of strong demand growth tend to encourage new development however the rate of supply growth also is influenced by a number of additional factors including the availability of capital interest rates construction costs and unique market considerations the relatively long leadtime required to complete the development of hotels makes supply growth easier to forecast than demand growth but increases the volatility of the cyclical behavior of the lodging industry as illustrated in the charts below at different points in the cycle demand may increase when there is no new supply or supply may grow when demand is declining the decline in lodging demand during the recession of 2008 through    2    table of contents  2009 and the lack of available financing for new hotel construction caused a significant reduction in hotel development as a result supply growth was relatively low in 2010 through 2012 and we expect growth through 2013 to continue to be below the historical growth rate of 2 based on data from smith travel research over the past 25 years  we anticipate that demand growth will exceed supply growth in the near term resulting in continued revpar growth which is consistent with analysis prepared by pkf hospitality research occupancy levels in the upperupscale market are currently close to their 15year average therefore while there is still potential for occupancy growth we believe revpar growth will primarily be driven by increases in average room rate however the pace of economic recovery and general market uncertainty will continue to impact negatively the pace of improvement in the industry therefore there can be no assurance that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties or improvement in margins will continue for any number of reasons including those listed above  the charts below detail the historical supply demand and revpar growth for the us lodging industry and for the upper upscale segment for 2008 to 2012 and forecast data for 2013 our portfolio primarily consists of upper upscale hotels and accordingly its performance is best understood in comparison to the upper upscale segment rather than the entire industry  us lodging industry supply demand and revpar growth         3    table of contents us upper upscale supply demand and revpar growth       business strategy  our primary longterm business objective is to provide superior total returns to our equity holders through a combination of appreciation in asset values growth in earnings and dividend distributions to achieve this objective we seek to            drive operating results at our properties through aggressive asset management            acquire properties in urban and resortconference destinations that are operated by leading management companies we will continue to focus on target markets and gateway cities such as new york washington dc boston miami chicago los angeles san francisco san diego and seattle which we believe have strong demand generators that appeal to multiple customer segments and have high barriers to entry that limit new supply while our focus will remain primarily on luxury and upper upscale properties we will remain opportunistic and may acquire or develop hotels in other lodging segments or markets            strategically invest in major redevelopment and return on investment roi projects in order to maximize the inherent value in our portfolio            maintain a strong balance sheet with a low leverage level and balanced debt maturities in order to minimize our cost of capital and to maximize our financial flexibility in order to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging cycle            expand our global portfolio holdings and revenue sources through joint ventures or direct acquisitions that diversify our investments and            recycle capital through the disposition of assets to better align our portfolio within our target gateway markets we also may opportunistically dispose of hotels to take advantage of market conditions or in situations where the hotels are at a competitive risk    4    table of contents acquisitions and new development our acquisition strategy focuses on acquiring hotels at attractive yields that exceed our cost of capital in our target markets these markets consist of gateway cities in the us and in key international cities that are positioned to attract premium corporate leisure and international travelers while at the same time have significant barriers to entry based on historical trends we believe these markets will have favorable longterm supply and demand dynamics and consequently better potential for revenue growth in the us we will focus primarily on acquiring upper upscale and luxury hotels and secondarily developing midscale and upscale hotels with strategic partners in these target markets our efforts in europe will be to acquire upper upscale and luxury hotels in our target markets such as london paris and munich in the asiapacific and latin america regions we will concentrate on both the acquisition of upper upscale and luxury hotels and the development of midscale and upscale hotels in our target markets such as australia and brazil  redevelopment and return on investment projects we pursue opportunities to enhance asset value by completing select capital improvements outside the scope of recurring renewal and replacement capital expenditures these projects are designed to take advantage of changing market conditions and the favorable location of our properties to enhance customer satisfaction and increase profitability we evaluate our capital expenditure projects based on their economic and environmental impact in collaboration with our hotel managers we evaluate new products and systems designed to yield predictable and targeted results while improving overall energy efficiency and reducing water consumption examples include inroom and central energy management systems lighting retrofits low flow plumbing fixtures and intelligent landscape irrigation systems  redevelopment projects these projects are designed to optimally position our hotels within their markets and competitive set redevelopment projects include extensive renovations of guest rooms including bathrooms lobbies food and beverage outlets expanding ballroom and meeting rooms and major mechanical system upgrades  targeted return on investment projects these roi projects often are smaller and focused on specific areas such as converting unprofitable or underutilized space into meeting space or adding guestrooms we also target projects that improve utility efficiency through the implementation and adoption of proven sustainable technologies  value enhancement capital projects these projects identify and execute strategies that seek to maximize the highest and best use of all aspects of our hotels these projects include the development of timeshare or condominium units on excess land or the acquisition of air rights or development entitlements that add value to our portfolio currently or in the event that we sell the hotel  acquisition projects in conjunction with the acquisition of a property we prepare capital and operational improvement plans designed to improve profitability and enhance the guest experience these projects may include required renewal and replacement projects significant redevelopment and even rebranding of the property and represent a key component of our decision to invest in a hotel that are typically completed within two to three years  asset management as host inc is the nations largest lodging reit with a diverse portfolio of properties we are in a unique position to work with our managers to maximize revenues while minimizing operating costs the size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading operators and brands in the industry allow us to benchmark similar hotels and identify best practices and efficiencies that can be implemented at our properties all of which improve the longterm profitability of the hotel  a key component of our asset management strategy is maintaining the high standards of product quality of our properties we work closely with our managers to ensure that renewal and replacement expenditures are spent efficiently in order to maximize the profitability of the hotel typically room refurbishments occur at intervals of approximately seven years but the timing may vary based on the type of property and equipment being replaced these refurbishments generally are divided into the following types soft goods case goods bathroom and    5    table of contents  infrastructure soft goods include items such as carpeting bed spreads curtains and wall vinyl and may require more frequent updates in order to maintain brand quality standards case goods include items such as dressers desks couches restaurant and meeting room chairs and tables and generally are not replaced as frequently bathroom renovations range from refresh of vinyl and paint to full renovation and replacement of tile vanity lighting and plumbing fixtures infrastructure includes the physical plant of the hotel including the roof elevators façade and fire systems which are subject to regular maintenance and then replaced at the end of their useful lives  capital structure and liquidity profile in order to maintain its qualification as a reit host inc is required to distribute 90 of its taxable income other than net capital gain to its stockholders and as a result generally relies on external sources of capital to finance growth we use a variety of debt and equity instruments to fund our external growth including senior notes and mortgage debt exchangeable debentures common and preferred stock offerings issuances of host lp partnership units and joint ventureslimited partnerships to take advantage of the prevailing market conditions while we may issue debt at any time management believes it is prudent over time to target a leverage ratio of approximately 30x debttoebitda consistent with this strategy we have significantly improved our credit statistics over the past several years we believe that lower leverage reduces our overall cost of capital and our earnings volatility and increases our access to capital thereby providing us with the necessary flexibility to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging cycle which we consider a key competitive advantage  we also seek to structure our debt profile to allow us to access different forms of financing primarily senior notes and exchangeable debentures as well as mortgage debt particularly outside of the us when debt is priced reasonably generally this means we look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt minimize nearterm maturities and maintain a balanced maturity schedule  joint ventures we expect to continue to utilize joint ventures to finance external growth we believe joint ventures provide a significant means to access external capital and spread the inherent risk of hotel ownership our primary focus for joint ventures is in international markets which helps to diversify exposure to market risk  dispositions our disposition strategy is aligned with our overall portfolio focus to reallocate our investments to target gateway markets generally our dispositions will be focused on secondary or tertiary markets or as part of our strategy to limit our total investment within individual markets we may dispose of assets in our primary markets through direct sales or through the creation of joint ventures when we have the opportunity to capitalize on value enhancement strategies and apply the proceeds to other business objectives additionally we will dispose of properties where we believe the potential for growth is constrained or on properties with significant capital expenditure requirements where we do not believe we would generate a significant return on the investment proceeds from dispositions are deployed to repay debt or fund acquisitions and roiredevelopment projects  corporate responsibility  hosts corporate responsibility strategy integrates fiscal environmental and social elements at both the corporate and portfolio levels our corporate responsibility program focuses on the following themes and objectives            responsible investment further consider sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities during the development and acquisition processes and throughout the ownership period            environmental stewardship collaborate with and support our hotel managers to reduce overall carbon emissions energy and water consumption and waste stream within our portfolio and            corporate citizenship strengthen the local communities where we do business through financial support partnership volunteerism and coordination with our hotel managers  management and governance our corporate responsibility program is managed by our corporate responsibility team and governed by our board of directors nominating and corporate governance committee  operating structure  host inc operates through an umbrella partnership structure in which substantially all of its assets are held by host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and holds approximately 986 of the op units as of    6    table of contents  december 31 2012 a reit is a corporation that has elected to be treated as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code and that meets certain ownership organizational and operating requirements set forth under the code in general through payments of dividends to stockholders a reit is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level each op unit owned by holders other than host inc is redeemable at the option of the holder for an amount of cash equal to the market value of one share of host inc common stock multiplied by a factor of 1021494 rather than a conversion factor of 1 shareop unit that existed prior to the december 2009 stock dividend host inc has the right to acquire any op unit offered for redemption directly from the holder in exchange for 1021494 shares of host inc common stock instead of host lp redeeming such op unit for cash additionally for every share of common stock issued by host inc host lp will issue 97895 op units to host inc as of december 31 2012 noncontrolling limited partners held 99 million op units which were convertible into 101 million host inc common shares assuming that all op units held by noncontrolling limited partners were converted into common shares there would have been 7347 million common shares of host inc outstanding at december 31 2012  our operating structure is as follows       because host inc has elected to be treated as a reit certain tax laws limit the amount of nonqualifying income that host inc and host lp can earn including income derived directly from the operation of hotels as a result we lease substantially all of our consolidated properties to certain of our subsidiaries designated as taxable reit subsidiaries trs for federal income tax purposes or to third party lessees our trs are subject to income tax and are not limited as to the amount of nonqualifying income they can generate the lessees and our trs enter into agreements with third parties to manage the operations of the hotels our trs also may own assets engaging in other activities that produce nonqualifying income such as the development of timeshare or condominium units subject to certain restrictions the difference between the hotels net operating cash flow and the aggregate rents paid to host lp is retained by our trs as taxable income accordingly the net effect of the trs leases is that while as a reit host inc generally is exempt from federal income tax to the extent that it meets specific distribution requirements among other reit requirements a portion of the net operating cash flow from our properties is subject to federal state and if applicable foreign income tax    7    table of contents our hotel properties  overview we have 118 hotels in our portfolio primarily consisting of luxury and upper upscale properties these hotels generally are located in the central business districts of major cities near airports and resortconference destinations that because of their locations typically benefit from barriers to entry for new supply these properties typically include meeting and banquet facilities a variety of restaurants and lounges swimming pools exercise facilities andor spas gift shops and parking facilities the combination of which enable them to serve business leisure and group travelers fortytwo of our hotels representing approximately 59 of our revenues have in excess of 500 rooms the average age of our properties is 28

competition often is specific to individual markets and is based on a number of factors including location brand guest facilities and amenities level of service room rates and the quality of accommodations the lodging industry generally is viewed as consisting of six different segments each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs luxury upper upscale upscale midscale with and without food and beverage service and economy the classification of a property is based on lodging industry standards which take into consideration many factors such as guest facilities and amenities level of service and quality of accommodations most of our hotels operate in urban and resort markets either as luxury properties under such brand names as fairmont four seasons grand hyatt jw marriott ritzcarlton st regis the luxury collection and w or as upper upscale properties under such brand names as embassy suites hilton hyatt le méridien marriott executive apartments marriott marquis marriott suites pullman renaissance sheraton swissôtel and westin we also may selectively invest in upscale and midscale properties such as courtyard by marriott crowne plaza four points by sheraton hyatt place ibis novotel or residence inn by marriott particularly in international markets1 while our hotels primarily compete with other hotels in the luxury and upper upscale segments they also may compete with hotels in other lowertier segments  we believe our properties enjoy competitive advantages associated with the hotel brands under which they operate the international marketing programs and reservation systems of these brands combined with the strong management systems and expertise they provide should enable our properties to perform favorably in terms of both occupancy and room rates in addition repeat guest business is enhanced by guest reward or guest recognition programs offered by most of these brands nevertheless many management contracts for our hotels do not prohibit our managers from converting franchising or developing other hotel properties in our markets as a result our hotels compete with other hotels that our managers may own invest in manage or franchise  we also compete with other reits and other public and private investors for the acquisition of new properties and investment opportunities in both domestic and international markets as we attempt to position our portfolio to take best advantage of changes in markets and travel patterns of our customers  seasonality  our hotel sales traditionally have experienced moderate seasonality which varies based on the individual property and the region historically our reporting cycle for hotel revenues for our domestic marriottmanaged hotels reflects 16 or 17 weeks of results in the fourth quarter compared to 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters of the year for our nonmarriott managed hotels the first quarter includes two months of operations

current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances these laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances in addition certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of hazardous or toxic materials and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released hazardous or toxic materials environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated and these restrictions may require corrective or other expenditures in connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels we potentially may be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities although currently we are not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us we can offer no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future  operational agreements  all of our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements with some of those hotels also subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operation under the designated brand under these agreements the managers generally have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the daytoday operation of the hotels including establishing room rates securing and processing reservations procuring inventories supplies and services providing periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers technical and operational experts and promoting and publicizing the hotels the managers provide all managerial and other employees for the hotels review the operation and maintenance of the hotels prepare reports budgets and projections and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels these support services include planning and policy services divisional financial services product planning and development employee staffing and training corporate executive management and certain inhouse legal services we have certain approval rights over budgets capital expenditures significant leases and contractual commitments and various other matters  general terms and provisions  agreements governing the management and operation of our hotels typically include the terms described below            term and fees for operational services the initial term of our management and operating agreements generally is 15 to 25 years with one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager the majority of our management agreements condition the managers right to exercise options for specified renewal terms upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria the manager typically receives compensation in the form of a base management fee which is calculated as a percentage generally 23 of annual gross revenues and an incentive management fee which typically is calculated as a percentage generally 1020 of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the hotel in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the base management fee only is 1 of annual gross revenues but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable to starwood under a separate license agreement as described below            license services in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels the operation of the hotels is subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to the designated brand including rights to use trademarks service marks and logos matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services although the term of these license agreements with starwood generally is coterminous with the corresponding operating    13    table of contents       agreements the license agreements contemplate the potential for continued brand affiliation even in the event of a termination of the operating agreement as noted above the starwood licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees generally 5 of gross revenues attributable to room sales and 2 of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales which amounts supplement the lower base management fee of 1 of gross revenues received by starwood under the operating agreements            chain or system programs and services managers are required to provide chain or system programs and services generally that are furnished on a centralized basis such services include the development and operation of certain computer systems and reservation services regional or other centralized management and administrative services marketing and sales programs and services training and other personnel services and other centralized or regional services as may be determined to be more efficiently performed on a centralized regional or group basis rather than on an individual hotel basis costs and expenses incurred in providing these chain or system programs and services generally are allocated on a cost reimbursement basis among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates or that otherwise benefit from these services            working capital and fixed asset supplies we are required to maintain working capital for each hotel and to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies for example linen china glassware silver and uniforms we also are responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds available from working capital are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels for certain hotels the working capital accounts which would otherwise be maintained by the managers for each of such hotels are maintained on a pooled basis with managers being authorized to make withdrawals from such pooled account as otherwise contemplated with respect to working capital in accordance with the provisions of the management or operating agreements            furniture fixtures and equipment replacements we are required to provide the managers with all furniture fixtures and equipment ffampe necessary for the operation of the hotels including funding any required ffampe replacements on an annual basis the managers prepare budgets for ffampe to be acquired and certain routine repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the necessary funds which budgets are subject to our review and approval for purposes of funding such expenditures a specified percentage typically 5 of the gross revenues of each hotel is deposited by the manager into an escrow or reserve account in our name to which the manager has access in the case of our starwoodmanaged hotels our operating agreements contemplate that this reserve account also may be used to fund the cost of certain major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building as described below for certain of our marriottmanaged hotels we have entered into an agreement with marriott to allow for such expenditures to be funded from one pooled reserve account rather than funds being deposited into separate reserve accounts at each hotel with the minimum required balance maintained on an ongoing basis in that pooled reserve account being significantly below the amount that would otherwise have been maintained in such separate hotel reserve accounts for certain of our starwoodmanaged hotels the periodic reserve fund contributions which otherwise would be deposited into reserve accounts maintained by managers for each hotel are distributed to us and as to this pool of hotels we are responsible for providing funding of expenditures which otherwise would be funded from reserve accounts for each of the subject hotels            building alterations improvements and renewals the managers are required to prepare an annual estimate of the expenditures necessary for major repairs alterations improvements renewals and replacements to the structural mechanical electrical heating ventilating air conditioning plumbing and elevators of each hotel along with alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required in the managers reasonable judgment to keep the hotel in a competitive efficient and economical operating condition that is consistent with brand standards we generally have approval rights as to such budgets and expenditures which we review and approve based on our managers recommendations and on our judgment expenditures for these major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building typically are funded directly by owners although as noted above our agreements with starwood contemplate that certain such expenditures may be funded from the reserve account    14    table of contents         treatment of additional owner funding as additional owner funding becomes necessary either for expenditures generally funded from the ffampe replacement funds or for any major repairs or improvements to the hotel building which may be required to be funded directly by owners most of our agreements provide for an economic benefit to us through an impact on the calculation of incentive management fees payable to our managers one approach frequently utilized at our marriottmanaged hotels is to provide such owner funding through loans which are repaid with interest from operational revenues with the repayment amounts reducing operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees another approach typically that is used at our starwoodmanaged hotels as well as with certain expenditures projects at our marriottmanaged hotels is to treat such owner funding as an increase to our investment in the hotel resulting in an increase to owners priority return with a corresponding reduction to the amount of operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees for our starwoodmanaged hotels that are subject to the pooled arrangement described above the amount of any additional reserve account funding is allocated to each of such hotels on a pro rata basis determined with reference to the net operating income of each hotel and the total net operating income of all such pooled hotels for the most recent operating year            territorial protections certain management and operating agreements impose restrictions for a specified period which limit the manager and its affiliates from owning operating or licensing a hotel of the same brand within a specified area the area restrictions vary with each hotel from city blocks in urban areas to up to a multimile radius from the hotel in other areas            sale of the hotel subject to specific agreements as to certain hotels see below under special termination rights we generally are limited in our ability to sell lease or otherwise transfer the hotels by the requirement that the transferee assume the related management agreements and meet specified other conditions including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the manager            performance termination rights in addition to any right to terminate that may arise as a result of a default by the manager most of our management and operating agreements include reserved rights by us to terminate management or operating agreements on the basis of the managers failure to meet certain performancebased metrics typically including a specified threshold return on owners investment in the hotel along with a failure of the hotel to achieve a specified revpar performance threshold established with reference to other competitive hotels in the market typically such performancebased termination rights arise in the event the operator fails to achieve specified performance thresholds over a consecutive twoyear period and are subject to the managers ability to cure and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts or in some instances waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees we have agreed in the past and may agree in the future to waive certain of these termination rights in exchange for consideration from a manager or its affiliates which consideration may include cash compensation or amendments to management agreements            special termination rights in addition to any performancebased or other termination rights set forth in our management and operating agreements we have negotiated with marriott and starwood specific termination rights as to certain management and operating agreements while the brand affiliation of a property may increase the value of a hotel the ability to dispose of a property unencumbered by a management agreement or even brand affiliation also can increase the value for prospective purchasers these termination rights can take a number of different forms including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation as well as termination without sale or other condition which may require payment of a fee these termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by ebitda require that a certain number of properties continue to maintain the brand affiliation or be restricted to a specific pool of assets    15    table of contents employees  as of december 31 2012 we had 233 employees of which 208 work in the united states we had 25 employees located in our offices in london rio de janeiro amsterdam and singapore none of hosts employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements other than those working in our office in rio de janeiro these employee numbers do not include the 522 hotel employees of our new zealand and australian properties which also are host employees as they are under the direct supervision and control of our thirdparty hotel managers our thirdparty managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels although we do not manage employees at our consolidated hotels we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force particularly those hotels with unionized labor we believe relations with these employees are positive for a discussion of these relationships see part i
