 for more information on the verdict and the status of the appeal  we also are involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business and are vigorously defending these claims however no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings we believe based on currently available information that the results of such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but might be material to our operating results for any particular period depending in part upon the operating results for such period  we also could become the subject of future claims by the operators of our hotels individuals or companies who use our hotels our investors our joint venture partners or regulating entities and these claims could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and performance  we may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities related to hotels or businesses we acquire  assets and entities that we have acquired or may in the future acquire may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse or only limited recourse against the sellers in general the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements may not survive long enough for us to become aware of such liabilities and seek recourse against our sellers while usually we require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive such indemnification often is limited and subject to various materiality thresholds a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses as a result there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with acquired hotels and entities may exceed our expectations plus we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects all of which may affect adversely our revenues expenses operating results and financial condition finally indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the assets and entities acquired by us while the sellers generally are contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities without regard to survival limitations materiality thresholds deductibles or caps on losses there can be no guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses in addition to those incurred by the sellers  we depend on our key personnel  our success depends on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel none of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers we cannot assure you that these key personnel will remain employed by us while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our financial performance  exchange rate fluctuations could affect adversely our financial results  as a result of the expansion of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the euro the canadian dollar the mexican peso the australian dollar the new zealand dollar the british pound sterling the polish zloty the brazilian real and the chilean peso in 2012 revenues in these currencies represented approximately 5 of our total revenues although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of these and other foreign currencies these transactions if entered into will not eliminate that risk entirely to the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in the same currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate revenues or earnings in other currencies the conversion of such amounts into us dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our revenues or earnings    25    table of contents applicable reit laws may restrict certain business activities  as a reit host inc is subject to various restrictions on the types of income it can earn assets it can own and activities in which it can engage business activities that could be impacted by applicable reit laws include but are not limited to activities such as developing alternative uses of real estate including the development andor sale of timeshare or condominium units due to these restrictions we anticipate that we will conduct certain business activities including those mentioned above in one or more of our taxable reit subsidiaries our taxable reit subsidiaries are taxable as regular c corporations and are subject to federal state local and if applicable foreign taxation on their taxable income  we may be unable to sell properties because real estate investments are inherently illiquid  real estate properties generally cannot be sold quickly and accordingly we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions the inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could affect adversely our financial condition and the ability to service our debt in addition under the federal income tax laws applicable to reits we may be limited in our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets  our ground lease payments may increase faster than the revenues we receive on the hotels located on the leased properties  as of december 31 2012 38 of our hotels are subject to thirdparty ground leases encumbering all or a portion of the hotel these ground leases generally require periodic increases in ground rent payments which are often based on economic indicators such as the consumer price index our ability to pay ground rent could be affected adversely to the extent that our hotel revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases in addition if we were to sell a hotel encumbered by a ground lease the buyer would be required to assume the ground lease which may result in a lower sales price  environmental problems are possible and can be costly  we believe that our properties comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws unidentified environmental liabilities could arise however and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property the owner or operator may be required to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site environmental laws also govern the presence maintenance and removal of toxic or hazardous substances these laws require that owners or operators of buildings properly manage and maintain these substances and notify and train those who may come into contact with them and undertake special precautions these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to toxic or hazardous materials  compliance with other government regulations can be costly  our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation including title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety under the ada all    26    table of contents  public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons these laws and regulations may be changed from timetotime or new regulations adopted resulting in additional costs of compliance including potential litigation for example the ada was revised substantially in september 2010 and our facilities were required to comply with the new regulations by march 15 2012 a determination that we are not in compliance with the ada could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance imposition of fines or an award of attorneys fees to private litigants compliance with the ada and other laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations  in addition the operations of our international properties are subject to a variety of united states and international laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws but we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international properties might be subject and the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted  risks of ownership of host incs common stock  there are limitations on the acquisition of host inc common stock and changes in control  host incs charter and bylaws the partnership agreement of host lp and the maryland general corporation law the mgcl contain a number of provisions the exercise or existence of which could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for host incs stockholders or host lps unitholders or otherwise be in their best interests including the following            restrictions on transfer and ownership of host incs stock to maintain host incs qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of host incs outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned in the last half of the taxable year directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals which as defined in the code may include certain entities in addition if host inc or one or more owners of 10 or more of host inc actually or constructively owns 10 or more of a tenant of host inc or a tenant of any partnership in which host inc is a partner the rent received by host inc either directly or through any such partnership from such tenant generally will not be qualifying income for purposes of the reit income qualification tests of the code and therefore could jeopardize host incs qualification as a reit unless the tenant qualifies as a trs and certain other requirements are met  accordingly host incs charter prohibits ownership directly or by attribution by any person or persons acting as a group of more than 98 in value or number whichever is more restrictive of shares of host incs outstanding common stock preferred stock or any other class or series of stock each considered as a separate class or series for this purpose together these limitations are referred to as the ownership limit  stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the intended acquirer of the stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any distributions thereon to vote those shares of stock or to receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the stock in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the stock or the amount realized from the sale a transfer of shares of host incs stock to a person who as a result of the transfer violates the ownership limit may be void under certain circumstances and in any event would deny that person any of the economic benefits of owning shares of host incs stock in excess of the ownership limit these restrictions will not apply if host incs board of directors determines that it is no longer in host incs best interests to continue to qualify as a reit or that compliance with the restrictions on transfer and ownership is no longer required for host inc to qualify as a reit            removal of board of directors host incs charter provides that except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or series of shares of capital stock other than common stock directors may be removed only for cause and by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least twothirds of all    27    table of contents       the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors vacancies on host incs board of directors may be filled at any regular meeting or at any special meeting called for that purpose by the affirmative vote of the remaining directors except that a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the entire board of directors any vacancy resulting from the removal of a director by the stockholders may be filled by the affirmative vote of holders of at least twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors            preferred shares classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval host incs charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that host inc has authority to issue is 1100000000 consisting of 1050000000 shares of common stock and 50000000 shares of preferred stock host incs board of directors has the authority without a vote of stockholders to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock and to establish the terms preferences conversion or other rights voting powers restrictions limitations as to dividends and other distributions qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series because host incs board of directors has this power it may give the holders of any class or series of stock terms preferences powers and rights including voting rights senior to the rights of holders of existing stock            certain provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a thirdparty to acquire control of host inc certain provisions of the mgcl may have the effect of inhibiting a thirdparty from acquiring host inc including            business combination provisions that subject to limitations prohibit certain business combinations between a corporation and an interested stockholder defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of the corporations then outstanding shares of voting stock or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who at any time within the two year period immediately prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation or an affiliate of any interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and thereafter imposes two supermajority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations and            control share provisions that provide that holders of control shares of a corporation defined as voting shares of stock that if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned or controlled by the acquirer would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors acquired in a control share acquisition defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding all interested shares  host inc is subject to the maryland business combination statute our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share provisions of the mgcl there can be no assurance that this bylaw provision exempting us from the control share provisions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future  additionally title 3 subtitle 8 of the mgcl permits our board of directors without stockholder approval and regardless of what currently is provided in our charter or bylaws to implement certain takeover defenses such as a classified board some of which we do not have            merger consolidation share exchange and transfer of host incs assets under maryland law and host incs charter subject to the terms of any outstanding class or series of capital stock we can merge with or into another entity consolidate with one or more other entities participate in a share exchange or transfer host incs assets within the meaning of the mgcl if approved 1 by host incs board of directors in the manner provided in the mgcl and 2 by host incs stockholders holding twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter except that any merger of host inc with or into a trust organized for the purpose of changing host incs form of organization from a corporation to a trust    28    table of contents       requires only the approval of host incs stockholders holding a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the merger under the mgcl specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange only is required to be approved by the board of directors of a maryland corporation if the corporation is the successor entity host incs voluntary dissolution also would require approval of stockholders holding twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter            certain charter and bylaw amendments host incs charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transfer and ownership of host incs stock fixing the size of the board of directors within the range set forth in the charter removal of directors the filling of vacancies exculpation and indemnification of directors calling special stockholder meetings and others all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the board of directors and approved by host incs stockholders holding twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter other charter amendments generally require approval of the board and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter as permitted under the mgcl host incs charter and bylaws provide that the board of directors has the exclusive right to amend host incs bylaws these provisions may make it more difficult to amend host incs charter and bylaws to alter the provisions described herein that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control or the acquisition of host inc common stock without the approval of the board of directors  shares of host incs common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share price of host incs common stock  we may issue additional shares of common stock to raise the capital necessary to finance hotel acquisitions fund capital expenditures refinance debt or for other corporate purposes sales of a substantial number of shares of host incs common stock or the perception that sales could occur could affect adversely prevailing market prices for host incs common stock in addition holders of op units who redeem their units and receive at host incs election shares of host inc common stock will be able to sell those shares freely as of december 31 2012 there are approximately 99 million op units outstanding owned by third parties that are redeemable which represents approximately 14 of all outstanding units further a substantial number of shares of host incs common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans we maintain two stockbased compensation plans i the comprehensive stock plan whereby we may award to participating employees and directors restricted shares of common stock options to purchase common stock and deferred shares of common stock and ii an employee stock purchase plan at december 31 2012 there were approximately 19 million shares of host incs common stock reserved and available for issuance under the comprehensive stock plan and employee stock purchase plan and 10 million outstanding options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of 986 per share  also as of december 31 2012 host lp had outstanding 575 million principal amount of exchangeable senior debentures that could become exchangeable under certain conditions for shares of host incs common stock although the exchange conditions currently have not been satisfied these debentures would be exchangeable for approximately 41 million shares based on the current exchange prices for 400 million of such exchangeable debentures however host inc has the option to issue cash shares of host incs common stock or any combination thereof in settlement of the debentures should they be presented for exchange  on april 24 2012 host inc entered into two sales financing agreements one with each of bny mellon capital markets llc and scotia capital usa inc through which host inc may issue and sell from time to time shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 400 million the sales will be made in at the market offerings under sec rules including sales made directly on the new york stock exchange each of bny mellon capital markets llc and scotia capital usa inc is acting as sales agent host inc may sell shares of common stock under its program from time to time based on market conditions although it is not under an obligation to sell any shares as of december 31 2012 approximately 100 million of host incs common stock have been issued and sold pursuant to the program shares of host incs common stock having an aggregate offering price of approximately 300 million remain issuable from time to time under the agreements any additional shares of common stock issued by host inc whether issued under this program or otherwise would be available in the future for sale in the public markets    29    table of contents our earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of host incs common stock  we believe that the market value of a reits equity securities is based primarily upon the markets perception of the reits growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions whether from operations sales acquisitions development or refinancings and secondarily is based upon the value of the underlying assets for that reason shares of host incs common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may impact negatively the market price of host incs common stock our failure to meet the markets expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would affect adversely the market price of host incs common stock  market interest rates may affect the price of shares of host incs common stock  we believe that one of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a reit is the dividend rate on the shares considered as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of reit shares may expect a higher dividend rate thus higher market interest rates could cause the market price of host incs common stock to decrease  federal income tax risks  to qualify as a reit each of host inc and its subsidiary reits are required to distribute at least 90 of its taxable income excluding net capital gain regardless of available cash or outstanding obligations  to continue to qualify as a reit host inc is required to distribute to its stockholders with respect to each year at least 90 of its taxable income excluding net capital gain to the extent that host inc satisfies this distribution requirement but distributes less than 100 of its taxable income and net capital gain for the taxable year it will be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition host inc will be subject to a nondeductible 4 excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by host inc with respect to the calendar year are less than the sum of 1 85 of its ordinary income 2 95 of its net capital gain and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior years less excess distributions from prior years host inc intends to make distributions subject to the availability of cash and in compliance with any debt covenants to its stockholders in order to comply with the distribution requirement and to avoid the imposition of a significant nondeductible 4 excise tax and will rely for this purpose on distributions from host lp and its subsidiaries there are differences in timing between host incs recognition of taxable income and its receipt of cash available for distribution due to among other things the seasonality of the lodging industry and the fact that some taxable income will be phantom taxable income which is taxable income that is not matched by cash flow due to transactions entered into in years prior to host incs conversion to a reit host inc could recognize substantial amounts of phantom taxable income in the future it is possible that any differences between the recognition of taxable income and the receipt of the related cash could require us to borrow funds or for host inc to issue additional equity in order to enable host inc to meet its distribution requirements and therefore to maintain its reit status and to avoid the nondeductible 4 excise tax in addition because the reit distribution requirements prevent host inc from retaining earnings generally we will be required to refinance debt at its maturity with additional debt or equity it is possible that any of these sources of funds if available at all would not be sufficient to meet host incs distribution and tax obligations  host lp owns 100 of the outstanding common stock and a portion of the outstanding preferred stock of two entities that have elected to be treated as reits each of these subsidiary reits are subject to the same requirements that host inc must satisfy in order to qualify as a reit including the distribution requirements described above  adverse tax consequences would occur if host inc or any of its subsidiary reits fail to qualify as a reit  we believe that host inc has been organized and has operated in such a manner so as to qualify as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year beginning january 1 1999 and host inc currently intends to    30    table of contents  continue to operate as a reit during future years in addition host inc owns through host lp two entities that have elected to be treated as reits as the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a reit are limited no assurance can be provided that host inc currently qualifies as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit or that each of host incs subsidiary reits qualify as a reit if any of the subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit it is possible that host inc would fail to qualify as a reit unless it or the subsidiary reit could avail itself of certain relief provisions new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change significantly the tax laws with respect to an entitys qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of its reit qualification if host inc or any of the subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit and any available relief provisions did not apply the nonqualifying reit would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates moreover unless entitled to statutory relief the nonqualifying reit would not qualify as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which reit qualification was lost  any determination that host inc or one of its subsidiary reits does not qualify as a reit will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could materially reduce the value of host incs common stock the additional tax liability of host inc or the subsidiary reit for the year or years in which the relevant entity did not qualify as a reit would reduce its net earnings available for investment debt service or distributions to stockholders furthermore the nonqualifying entity no longer would be required to make distributions to stockholders as a condition to reit qualification and all of its distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary c corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that if host inc were to fail to qualify as a reit host incs stockholders currently taxed as individuals would be taxed on those dividends at capital gain rates and host incs corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the code host incs failure to qualify as a reit also would cause an event of default under host lps credit facility which default could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due thereunder which in turn would constitute an event of default under host lps outstanding debt securities  if our leases are not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes each of host inc and its subsidiary reits would fail to qualify as a reit  to qualify as a reit host inc must satisfy two gross income tests pursuant to which specified percentages of its gross income must be passive income such as rent for the rent paid pursuant to the hotel leases with our trs which rental income currently constitutes substantially all of host incs and each of our subsidiary reits gross income to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests our leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and must not be treated as service contracts joint ventures or some other type of arrangement we believe that the leases will be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance however that the internal revenue service irs will agree with this characterization if the leases were not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes neither host inc nor either of our subsidiary reits would be able to satisfy either of the two gross income tests applicable to reits and each likely would lose its reit status  if our affiliated lessees fail to qualify as taxable reit subsidiaries each of host inc and its subsidiary reits would fail to qualify as a reit  rent paid by a lessee that is a related party tenant of host inc will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to reits we lease substantially all of our hotels to our subsidiary that is taxable as a regular c corporation and that has elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary with respect to host inc so long as any affiliated lessee qualifies as a taxable reit subsidiary it will not be treated as a related party tenant we believe that our affiliated lessees have qualified and will continue to qualify and that the taxable reit subsidiaries of each of our subsidiary reits have qualified and will continue to qualify to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance however that the irs will not challenge the status of a taxable reit subsidiary for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in disqualifying any of our affiliated lessees including the taxable reit subsidiaries of our subsidiary reits from treatment as a taxable reit subsidiary it is possible that    31    table of contents  host inc or a subsidiary reit would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to reits and substantially all of its income would fail to qualify for the gross income tests if host inc or a subsidiary reit failed to meet either the asset tests or the gross income tests each likely would lose its reit status  despite the reit status of each of host inc and its subsidiary reits we remain subject to various taxes  one of the subsidiary reits of host inc will be required to pay federal income tax at the highest regular corporate rate on builtin gain recognized as a result of the sale of one or more of its hotel assets prior to the expiration of the applicable 10year holding period including certain hotels acquired from starwood and its affiliates in 2006 the total amount of gain on which the subsidiary reit would be subject to corporate income tax if all of its builtin gain assets were sold in a taxable transaction prior to the expiration of the applicable 10year holding period would be material to it in addition we expect that we could recognize other substantial deferred tax liabilities in the future without any corresponding receipt of cash  notwithstanding host incs status as a reit host inc and our subsidiaries including our subsidiary reits are subject to some federal state local and foreign taxes on their income and property for example host inc and our subsidiary reits will pay tax on certain types of income that are not distributed and will be subject to a 100 excise tax on transactions with a taxable reit subsidiary that are not conducted on an arms length basis moreover the taxable reit subsidiaries of host inc and our subsidiary reits are taxable as regular c corporations and will pay federal state and local income tax on their net income at the applicable corporate rates and foreign taxes to the extent that they own assets or conduct operations in international jurisdictions  host lp is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes and any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc  if the irs were to challenge successfully host lps status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes host inc would cease to qualify as a reit and would suffer other adverse consequences  we believe that host lp qualifies to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership it is not subject to federal income tax on its income instead each of its partners including host inc is required to report and pay tax if applicable on such partners allocable share of its income no assurance can be provided however that the irs will not challenge host lps status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating host lp as a corporation for federal income tax purposes host inc would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to reits and accordingly cease to qualify as a reit if host lp fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or host inc fails to qualify as a reit either failure would cause an event of default under host lps credit facility that in turn could constitute an event of default under host lps outstanding debt securities also the failure of host lp to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes would cause it to become subject to federal state and foreign corporate income tax which tax would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners including host inc  as a reit each of host inc and its subsidiary reits is subject to limitations on its ownership of debt and equity securities  subject to certain exceptions a reit generally is prohibited from owning securities in any one issuer to the extent that 1 the value of such securities exceeds 5 of the value of the reits total assets 2 the securities owned by the reit represent more than 10 of the issuers outstanding voting securities or 3 the reit owns more than 10 of the value of the issuers outstanding securities a reit is permitted to own securities of a subsidiary in an amount that exceeds the 5 value test and the 10 vote or value test if the subsidiary elects to be a taxable reit subsidiary however a reit may not own securities of taxable reit subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 25 of the value of the reits total assets if host inc or any of its subsidiary reits were to violate these ownership limitations each likely would lose its reit status    32    table of contents each of host inc or its subsidiary reits may be required to pay a penalty tax upon the sale of a hotel  the federal income tax provisions applicable to reits provide that any gain realized by a reit on the sale of property held as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100 excise tax under existing law whether property including hotels is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is a question of fact that depends upon all of the facts and circumstances with respect to the particular transaction we intend to hold our hotels for investment with a view to longterm appreciation to engage in the business of acquiring and owning hotels and to make occasional sales of hotels consistent with our investment objectives there can be no assurance however that the irs might not contend that one or more of these sales are subject to the 100 excise tax  risks relating to redemption of op units  a holder who offers its op units for redemption may have adverse tax consequences  a holder whose op units are redeemed will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as having sold the op units the sale of these units is a taxable event and the holder thereof will be treated as realizing an amount equal to the sum of 1 the value of the common stock or cash the holder receives and 2 the amount of host lps nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units the gain or loss recognized by the holder of op units is measured by the difference between the amount realized by the holder and the holders basis in the op units redeemed which basis includes the amount of host lps nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units it is possible that the amount of gain andor the tax liability related thereto that the holder recognizes and pays could exceed the value of the common stock or cash that the holder receives  if a holder of op units elects to offer them for redemption the original receipt of the op units may be subject to tax  if a holder of op units elects to have its units redeemed particularly within two years of receiving them there is a risk that the original receipt of the op units may be treated as a taxable sale under the disguised sale rules of the internal revenue code subject to several exceptions the tax law generally provides that a partners contribution of property to a partnership and a simultaneous or subsequent transfer of money or other consideration from the partnership to the partner will be presumed to be a taxable sale in particular if money or other consideration is transferred by a partnership to a partner within two years of the partners contribution of property the transactions are presumed to be a taxable sale of the contributed property unless the facts and circumstances clearly establish that the transfers are not a sale on the other hand if two years have passed between the original contribution of property and the transfer of money or other consideration the transactions will not be presumed to be a taxable sale unless the facts and circumstances clearly establish that they should be so treated  differences between an investment in shares of host inc common stock and op units may affect redeemed holders of op units  if a holder of op units elects to have op units redeemed we will determine whether the holder receives cash or shares of host incs common stock in exchange for the op units although an
