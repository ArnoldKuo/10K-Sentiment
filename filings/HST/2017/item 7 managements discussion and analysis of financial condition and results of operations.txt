financial condition an increase in interest rates would increase the interest costs on our credit facility and on our floating rate debt and could impact adversely our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets  interest payments for borrowings on our credit facility and the mortgages on certain properties are based on floating rates as a result an increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes including investments in our portfolio as of december 31 2016 approximately 35 of our debt is subject to floating interest rates  rising interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures and increase interest costs on any debt that is refinanced we may from time to time enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps caps floors and other interest rate  20    hedging contracts currently the majority of our mortgages with floating rates including mortgages on our joint venture properties are fully or partially hedged through the use of floatingtofixed interest rate swaps or interest rate caps these agreements expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to dispose of assets as part of our business strategy  our expenses may not decrease if our revenue decreases  many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels such as debtservice payments property taxes insurance utilities and employee wages and benefits are relatively inflexible they do not necessarily decrease directly with a reduction in revenue at the hotels and may be subject to increases that are not tied to the performance of our hotels or the increase in the rate of inflation generally also as of december 31 2016 26 of our hotels are subject to thirdparty ground leases which generally require periodic increases in ground rent payments our ability to pay these rents could be affected adversely if our hotel revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases  additionally certain costs such as wages benefits and insurance may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period in the event of a significant decrease in demand our hotel managers may not be able to reduce the size of hotel work forces in order to decrease wages and benefits our managers also may be unable to offset any fixed or increased expenses with higher room rates any of our efforts to reduce operating costs also could adversely affect the future growth of our business and the value of our hotel properties our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations  we may acquire properties through various structures including transactions involving portfolios single assets joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits or similar real estate ownership entities we anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed with a combination of methods and a variety of sources of external capital including proceeds from host inc equity offerings issuance of limited partnership interests of host lp advances under our credit facility the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness and proceeds from the sale of assets our inability to access external sources of capital may limit our ability to finance acquisitions for a discussion of factors that may limit our access to sources of capital see we depend on external sources of capital for future growth therefore any disruption to our ability to access capital at times and on terms reasonably acceptable to us may affect adversely our business and results of operations in addition certain of these factors such as disruption in the global capital markets may limit the ability of purchasers to finance their acquisition of our hotels and therefore our ability to use disposition proceeds to finance our acquisitions we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations these adverse effects may occur because the performance of the property does not support the additional indebtedness and related interest expense that we incurred as a result of the acquisition in addition assets and entities that we have acquired or may in the future acquire may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse or only limited recourse against the sellers in general the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements may not survive long enough for us to become aware of such liabilities and to seek recourse against our sellers and indemnification covering representations and warranties often is limited and subject to various materiality thresholds a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses as a result there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with acquired hotels and entities may exceed our expectations plus we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects all of which may affect adversely our revenues expenses operating results and financial condition finally indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the assets and entities acquired by us while the sellers generally are contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities without regard to survival limitations materiality thresholds deductibles or caps on losses there can be no guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses in addition to those incurred by the sellers 21    we may not achieve the value we anticipate from new hotel developments or value enhancement projects at our existing hotels we currently are and in the future may be involved in the construction or development of hotel properties timeshare units or other alternate uses of portions of our existing properties including the development of retail office or apartments including through joint ventures there are risks inherent in any new development including          we may not obtain the zoning occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations necessary to complete the development a delay in receiving these approvals could affect adversely the returns we expect to receive           any new construction involves the possibility of construction delays and cost overruns that may increase project costs          defects in design or construction may result in delays and additional costs to remedy the defect or require a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the defect          we may not be able to meet the loan covenants in any financing obtained to fund the new development creating default risks           natural or manmade disasters may delay construction or increase construction costs          risks related to change in economic and market conditions between development commencement and stabilization          the development of timeshare units could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for residential fractional or interval ownership increases in mortgage rates andor decreases in mortgage availability market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell the timeshares for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we initially anticipated  in addition to the extent that developments are conducted through joint ventures this creates additional risks including the possibility that our partners may not meet their financial obligations or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours see we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts  any of the above factors could affect adversely our and our partners ability to complete the developments on schedule and along the scope that currently is contemplated or to achieve the intended value of these projects for these reasons there can be no assurances as to the value to be realized by us from these transactions or any future similar transactions we do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels  to maintain our status as a reit we are not permitted to operate any of our hotels as a result we have entered into management agreements with thirdparty managers to operate our hotel properties for this reason we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of our hotels such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates food and beverage pricing and certain similar matters although we consult with our hotel operators with respect to strategic business plans the hotel operators are under no obligation to implement any of our recommendations with respect to these matters while we monitor the hotel managers performance we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately the cash flow from our hotels may be affected adversely if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name because our management agreements are longterm in nature we also may not be able to terminate these agreements if we believe the manager is not performing adequately  from time to time we have had and continue to have differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements we generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations however if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to thirdparty dispute resolution failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements or the failure of our managers to adequately manage the risks associated with hotel operations could affect adversely our results of operations  in addition our hotel managers or their affiliates manage and in some cases own have invested in or provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete with our hotels all of which may result in conflicts of interest as a result our hotel managers have in the past made and may in the future make decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest  furthermore our management agreements for our brand managed properties generally have provisions that can restrict our ability to sell lease or otherwise transfer our hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions our ability to finance or sell our properties  22    depending upon the structure of such transactions may require the managers consent similarly decisions with respect to the repositioning of a hotel such as the outsourcing of food and beverage outlets may require the managers consent  the properties managed by marriott international account for most of our revenues and operating income adverse developments in marriotts business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us  on september 23 2016 marriott international completed its acquisition of starwood hotels and resorts worldwide bringing starwoods brands under marriotts management as a result of the merger approximately 78 of our properties as measured by revenues now are managed or franchised by marriott we rely on marriotts personnel expertise technical resources and information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage and maintain our hotel operations efficiently effectively profitably and in compliance with the terms responsibilities and duties of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations any adverse developments in marriotts business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties and could have a material adverse effect on us in addition the integration of starwoods brands under marriott management may expose us to additional risks and costs at our properties and will place a significant burden on marriotts management and internal resources and the potential for diversion of its attention from the daytoday business operations of its hotels including hotels owned by us we are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor  our thirdparty managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our consolidated hotels other than employing but not managing or supervising the employees at our properties in brazil and australia we still remain subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force particularly at those hotels with unionized labor from time to time hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes lockouts public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity we also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes involving our thirdparty managers and their labor force or other events the resolution of labor disputes or renegotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs a significant component of our hotel operating costs either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs as we are not the employer nor bound by any collective bargaining agreement we do not negotiate with any labor organization and it is the responsibility of each propertys manager to enter into such labor contracts our ability if any to have any meaningful impact on the outcome of these negotiations is restricted by and dependent on the individual management agreement covering a specific property and we may have little ability to control the outcome of these negotiations our hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive in the marketplace maintain brand standards or to comply with applicable laws or regulations the timing and costs of such renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments  we are required by our loan agreements or agreements with our hotel managers to make agreed upon capital expenditures in addition we will need to make further capital expenditures in order to remain competitive with other hotels to maintain the economic value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations the timing of these improvements can affect hotel performance particularly if the improvements require closure of a significant number of rooms or other features of the hotels such as ballrooms meeting space and restaurants these capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost overruns and delays in addition because we depend on external sources of capital we may not have the necessary funds to invest and if we fail to maintain our properties in accordance with brand standards set by our managers they may terminate the management agreement moreover we may not necessarily realize a significant or any improvement in the performance of the hotels in which we make these investments  our hotels are geographically concentrated in a limited number of large urban cities and accordingly we could be disproportionately harmed by adverse changes to these markets a natural disaster or threat of a terrorist attack  the concentration of our hotels in a limited number of large urban cities exposes us to greater risk to local economic or business conditions changes in hotel supply in these cities and other conditions than more geographically diversified hotel companies hotels in new york washington dc san diego san francisco boston florida hawaii atlanta and los angeles represented approximately 72 of our 2016 revenues an economic downturn an increase in hotel supply in these cities a natural disaster a terrorist attack or similar disaster in any one of these cities likely would cause a decline in the hotel market and adversely affect occupancy rates the financial performance of our hotels in these cities and our overall results of operations for example in october 2012 our operations in new york city and other east coast properties were impacted negatively by hurricane sandy in 2013 decreased us government demand for hotel rooms approximately 5 of our business in markets such as washington dc had a negative impact on our results of operations 23    the threat of terrorism also may negatively impact hotel occupancy and average daily rate due to resulting disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and concerns about travel safety hotels in major metropolitan areas such as the major cities that represent our target markets may be particularly adversely affected due to concerns about travel safety the possibility of future attacks may hamper business and leisure travel patterns and accordingly the performance of our business and our operations  the ownership of hotels outside the united states will expose us to risks related to owning hotels in those international markets  as of december 31 2016 we own directly 7 hotels located outside of the united states we also are party to a joint venture that owns 10 hotels in europe and to a joint venture that owns a noncontrolling interest in five hotels currently open and two hotels under development in india we may have difficulty managing our expansion into new geographic markets where we have limited knowledge and understanding of the local economy an absence of business relationships in the area or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures and regulations there are risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states which include           risks of noncompliance with varied and unfamiliar employment laws and practices           tax laws which may provide for income or other taxes or tax rates that exceed those of the us and which may provide that foreign earnings that are repatriated directly or indirectly are subject to dividend withholding tax requirements or other restrictions and which may affect our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a tax efficient manner           compliance with and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy           the willingness of domestic or international lenders to provide financing and changes in the availability cost and terms of such financing           rapid adverse changes in local political economic and market conditions           the ability to obtain insurance coverage related to terrorist events          changes of interest rates andor currency exchange rates and hyperinflation or deflation and difficulties in hedging these risks           regulations regarding the incurrence of debt          difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries and           difficulties in complying with us rules governing reits while operating outside of the united states  any of these factors could affect adversely our ability to obtain all of the intended benefits of our international expansion if we do not effectively manage this expansion and successfully integrate the international hotels into our organization our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected  we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts  we have made investments in joint ventures and are exploring further investment opportunities in the united states and internationally we may from time to time invest as a coventurer in other entities holding hotel properties instead of purchasing hotel properties directly we also may sell interests in existing properties to a third party as part of forming a joint venture with the third party investments in joint ventures may involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions coventurers often share control over the operation of a joint venture actions by a coventurer also could subject the assets to additional risks as a result of any of the following circumstances           our coventurer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our or the joint ventures interests or goals or           our coventurer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives  for certain joint ventures we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners disputes between us and our partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and may negatively impact operations  although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to the joint venture partners due to tax laws or other restrictions on our ability to repatriate non us earnings in a tax efficient manner additionally in some cases our joint venture partners share control over distributions and may choose to retain capital in the joint  24    venture rather than to distribute it because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us our failure to receive distributions from our joint ventures could reduce our cash flow return on these investments the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual or transient customers are booked through internet travel intermediaries search engines and peertopeer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our hotels if bookings shift to higher cost distribution channels including these internet travel intermediaries it could materially impact our revenues and profitability additionally as intermediary bookings increase these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from the brands and hotel management companies operating our hotels also although internet travel intermediaries traditionally have competed to attract transient business rather than group and convention business in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to large group and convention business if that growth continues it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and convention business consolidation of internet travel intermediaries and the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business also could divert bookings away from the websites of our hotel managers and increase our cost of sales full insurance recovery for terrorist acts may not be possible  we generally obtain terrorism insurance to cover property damage caused by acts of terrorism under separate standalone policies of insurance as well as policies on us properties which currently are subject to us federal government cost sharing as provided in the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act tripra which has been extended through december 31 2020 we also have terrorism insurance under our general liability program and in our program for directors and officers coverage we also obtain terrorism insurance to cover some of our foreign properties through insurance programs involving or administered by foreign governments we may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance policies for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts and neither us nor foreign terrorism insurance legislation or regulations ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future  while tripra allows direct insurers to be reimbursed for certain losses they incur on us properties resulting from nuclear biological chemical and radiological nbcr perils tripra does not require insurers to offer coverage for these perils and to date insurers are not willing to provide this coverage even with government reimbursement any damage related to war and to nbcr incidents therefore is excluded under policies covering our us properties moreover many of our foreign properties are not covered against nbcr perils we obtain a certain amount of property insurance coverage on our us properties for nbcr perils through our whollyowned subsidiary that acts as our direct insurer against such perils to the extent of reimbursement under tripra we ultimately are responsible for any loss borne by our insurance subsidiary  as a result of the above there remains uncertainty regarding the adequacy and cost of terrorism coverage that will be available to protect our interests in the event of terrorist attacks that impact our properties  some potential losses are not covered by insurance  we or our hotel managers carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability property business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties these policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar types of properties generally our allrisk property policies provide coverage that is available on a peroccurrence basis and that for each occurrence has an overall limit as well as various sublimits on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive sublimits exist for certain types of claims such as service interruption debris removal expediting costs landscaping replacement and natural disasters such as earthquakes floods and hurricanes and may be subject to annual aggregate coverage limits the dollar amounts of these sublimits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit in this regard hotels in certain of our markets including california florida and seattle have in the past been and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters recovery under the applicable policies also is subject to substantial deductibles and complex calculations of lost business income there is no assurance that this insurance where maintained will fully fund the rebuilding or restoration of a hotel that is impacted by an earthquake hurricane or other natural disaster or the income lost as a result of the damage our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined together for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sublimits contained in our policies have been exceeded and in the case where the manager of one of our hotels provides this coverage any such claims will be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the managers program for the same purpose therefore if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels or in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by the manager affects hotels owned by others the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or  25    sublimits depending on the type of claim have been reached each affected hotel only may receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available we may incur losses in excess of insured limits and as a result we may be even less likely to receive complete coverage for risks that affect multiple properties such as earthquakes hurricanes or certain types of terrorism  in addition there are other risks such as certain environmental hazards that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify coverage we also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier we could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel in that event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property  cyber threats and the risk of data breaches or disruptions of our managers or our own information technology systems could materially adversely affect our business our third party hotel managers are dependent on information technology networks and systems including the internet to access process transmit and store proprietary and customer information these complex networks include reservation systems vacation exchange systems hotel management systems customer databases call centers administrative systems and third party vendor systems these systems require the collection and retention of large volumes of personally identifiable information of hotel guests including credit card numbers our hotel managers may store and process such proprietary and customer information both on systems located at the hotels we own and other hotels operated by our third party managers their corporate locations and at thirdparty owned facilities including for example in a thirdparty hosted cloud environment these information networks and systems can be vulnerable to threats such as system network or internet failures computer hacking or business disruption cyberterrorism viruses worms or other malicious software programs and employee error negligence or fraud these threats can be introduced in any number of ways including through third parties accessing our hotel managers information networks and systems the risks from these cyber threats are significant we rely on the security systems of our managers to protect proprietary and customer information from these threats any compromise of our managers networks could result in a disruption to operations such as disruptions in fulfilling guest reservations delayed bookings or sales or lost guest reservations any of these events could in turn result in disruption of the operations of the hotels we own that are managed by them in increased costs and in potential litigation and liability all of our major hotel management companies and a majority of our third party operators maintain insurance against cyber threats however these policies provide varying limits and may be subject to sub limits for certain types of claims and it is not expected that these policies will provide a total recovery of all potential losses in addition public disclosure or loss of customer or proprietary information could result in damage to the managers reputation and a loss of confidence among hotel guests and result in reputational harm for the hotels owned by us and managed by them which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  in addition to the information technologies and systems of our managers used to operate our hotels we have our own corporate technologies and systems that are used to access store transmit and manage or support a variety of business processes there can be no assurance that the security measures we have taken to protect the contents of these systems will prevent failures inadequacies or interruptions in system services or that system security will not be breached through physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and attacks by hackers disruptions in service system shutdowns and security breaches in the information technologies and systems we use including unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our business our financial reporting and compliance and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties which could be significant and we do not currently insure against these losses litigation judgments or settlements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition  we are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business and are vigorously defending these claims however no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings we believe based on currently available information that the results of such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but might be material to our operating results for any particular period depending in part upon the operating results for such period we also could become the subject of future claims by the operators of our hotels individuals or companies who use our hotels our investors our joint venture partners or regulating entities and these claims could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and performance  we depend on our key personnel our continued success depends on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key personnel none of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers these  26    individuals are important to our business and strategy and to the extent that any of them departs and is not replaced with a qualified substitute such persons departure could harm our operations and financial condition  exchange rate fluctuations could affect adversely our financial results  currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position we generate revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the euro the canadian dollar the mexican peso the australian dollar the british pound sterling the swedish krona the brazilian real and the indian rupee although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of these and other foreign currencies these transactions if entered into will not eliminate entirely that risk to the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in that same currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate revenues or earnings in other currencies the conversion of such amounts to us dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our revenues or earnings  similarly changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies against the us dollar can result in increases or decreases in demand at our us properties from international travelers coming to the united states because of the concentration of our hotels in major us cities we may have more exposure to fluctuations in international travel to the united states than other lodging companies without investments located as heavily in these markets applicable reit laws may restrict certain business activities  as a reit host inc is subject to various restrictions on the types of income it can earn assets it can own and activities in which it can engage business activities that could be restricted by applicable reit laws include but are not limited to developing alternative uses of real estate including the development andor sale of timeshare or condominium units due to these restrictions we anticipate that we will conduct certain business activities including those mentioned above in one or more of our taxable reit subsidiaries our taxable reit subsidiaries are taxable as regular c corporations and are subject to federal state local and if applicable foreign taxation on their taxable income  environmental problems are possible and can be costly  our properties are subject to requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations unidentified environmental liabilities could arise and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance additionally even after we have sold a property we may be liable for environmental liabilities that occurred during our ownership federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property the owner or operator may be required to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site environmental laws also govern the presence maintenance and removal of toxic or hazardous substances these laws require that owners or operators of buildings properly manage and maintain these substances and notify and train those who may come into contact with them and undertake special precautions these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to toxic or hazardous materials  we face possible risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change we are subject to the risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change which can include more frequent or severe storms droughts hurricanes and flooding any of which could have a material adverse effect on our properties operations and business to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns our coastal markets also could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sealevels causing damage to our properties as a result we could become subject to significant losses andor repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance other markets may experience prolonged variations in temperature or precipitation that may limit access to the water needed to operate our hotels or significantly increase energy costs which may subject those properties to additional regulatory burdens such as limitations on water usage or stricter energy efficiency standards climate change also may affect our business by increasing the cost of or making unavailable property insurance on terms we find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events increasing operating costs at our properties such as the cost of water or  27    energy and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our properties against such risks there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our properties operations or business compliance with other government regulations can be costly  our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation including title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons these laws and regulations may be changed from timetotime or new regulations adopted resulting in additional costs of compliance including potential litigation a determination that we are not in compliance with the ada or other laws and regulations could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance imposition of civil penalties in cases brought by the justice department or an award of attorneys fees to private litigants compliance with the ada and other laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations  in addition the operations of our international properties are subject to a variety of united states and international laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws but we cannot assure that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international properties might be subject and the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted risks of ownership of host incs common stock  there are limitations on the acquisition of host inc common stock and changes in control  host incs charter and bylaws the partnership agreement of host lp and the maryland general corporation law the mgcl contain a number of provisions the exercise or existence of which could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for host incs stockholders or host lps unitholders including the following           restrictions on transfer and ownership of host incs stock to maintain host incs qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of host incs outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned in the last half of the taxable year directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals which as defined in the code may include certain entities accordingly host incs charter prohibits ownership directly or by attribution by any person or persons acting as a group of more than 98 in value or number whichever is more restrictive of shares of host incs outstanding common stock preferred stock or any other class or series of stock each considered as a separate class or series for this purpose together these limitations are referred to as the ownership limit  stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the intended acquirer of the stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any distributions thereon to vote those shares of stock or to receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the stock in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the stock or the amount realized from the sale a transfer of shares of host incs stock to a person who as a result of the transfer violates the ownership limit may be void under certain circumstances and in any event would deny that person any of the economic benefits of owning shares of host incs stock in excess of the ownership limit these restrictions will not apply if host incs board of directors determines that it no longer is in host incs best interests to continue to qualify as a reit or that compliance with the restrictions on transfer and ownership no longer is required for host inc to qualify as a reit           removal of members of the board of directors host incs charter provides that except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or series of shares of capital stock other than common stock directors may be removed only for cause and by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors vacancies on host incs board of directors may be filled at any regular meeting or at any special meeting

the election of directors           preferred shares classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval host incs charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that host inc has authority to issue is 1100000000 consisting of 1050000000 shares of common stock and 50000000 shares of preferred stock host incs board of directors has the authority without a vote of stockholders to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock and to establish the terms preferences conversion or other rights voting powers  28            restrictions limitations as to dividends and other distributions qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series because host incs board of directors has this power it may give the holders of any class or series of stock terms preferences powers and rights including voting rights senior to the rights of holders of existing stock           certain provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a thirdparty to acquire control of host inc certain provisions of the mgcl may have the effect of inhibiting a thirdparty from acquiring host inc including        o  business combination provisions that subject to limitations prohibit certain business combinations between a corporation and an interested stockholder defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of the corporations then outstanding shares of voting stock or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who at any time within the twoyear period immediately prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation or an affiliate of any interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and thereafter imposes two supermajority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations and         o  control share provisions that provide that holders of control shares of a corporation defined as voting shares of stock that if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned or controlled by the acquirer would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors acquired in a control share acquisition defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding all interested shares          host inc is subject to the maryland business combination statute our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share provisions of the mgcl there can be no assurance that this bylaw provision exempting us from the control share provisions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future           merger consolidation share exchange and transfer of host incs assets under maryland law and host incs charter subject to the terms of any outstanding class or series of capital stock we can merge with or into another entity convert consolidate with one or more other entities participate in a share exchange or transfer host incs assets within the meaning of the mgcl if approved 1 by host incs board of directors in the manner provided in the mgcl and 2 by host incs stockholders holding twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter except that any merger of host inc with or into a trust organized for the purpose of changing host incs form of organization from a corporation to a trust requires only the approval of host incs stockholders holding a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the merger under the mgcl specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange only is required to be approved by the board of directors of a maryland corporation if the corporation is the successor entity host incs voluntary dissolution also would require approval of stockholders holding twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter           certain charter amendments host incs charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transfer and ownership of host incs stock fixing the size of the board of directors within the range set forth in the charter removal of directors the filling of vacancies exculpation and indemnification of directors calling special stockholder meetings and others all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the board of directors and approved by host incs stockholders holding twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter other charter amendments generally require approval of the board and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter these provisions may make it more difficult to amend host incs charter to alter the provisions described herein that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control or the acquisition of host inc common stock without the approval of the board of directors  shares of host incs common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share price of host incs common stock  we have in the past and may in the future issue additional shares of common stock to raise the capital necessary to finance hotel acquisitions fund capital expenditures refinance debt or for other corporate purposes sales of a substantial number of shares of host incs common stock or the perception that sales could occur could affect adversely prevailing market prices for host incs common stock in addition holders of op units who redeem their units and receive at host incs election shares of host inc common stock will be able to sell those shares freely as of december 31 2016 there are approximately 86 million host lp op units outstanding owned by third parties that are redeemable which represents approximately 1 of all outstanding units further a substantial number of shares of host incs common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans as of december 31 2016 we maintain two stockbased compensation plans i the comprehensive stock plan whereby we may award to participating employees and directors restricted shares of common stock options to purchase common stock and deferred shares of common stock and ii an employee stock purchase plan at december 31 2016 there were approximately 14 million shares of host incs common stock reserved and available for issuance under the comprehensive stock plan  29    and employee stock purchase plan and 13 million outstanding options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of 1778 per share  our earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of host incs common stock  we believe that the market value of a reits equity securities is based primarily upon the markets perception of the reits growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions whether from operations sales acquisitions development or refinancings and secondarily is based upon the value of the underlying assets for that reason shares of host incs common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may impact negatively the market price of host incs common stock our failure to meet the markets expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would affect adversely the market price of host incs common stock additionally as a result of the 2016 us elections and ongoing activity in the us congress relating to tax reform proposals there is a heightened possibility of significant changes to us federal tax laws including the possibility of lower corporate tax rates which may make investments in reits relatively less attractive than they currently are federal income tax risks  adverse tax consequences would occur if host inc or its subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit we believe that host inc has been organized and has operated in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year beginning january 1 1999 and host inc currently intends to continue to operate as a reit during future years in addition host inc owns through host lp one entity that has elected to be treated as a reit as the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a reit are limited no assurance can be provided that host inc currently qualifies as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit or that host incs subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit if our subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit it is possible that host inc would fail to qualify as a reit unless it or the subsidiary reit could avail itself of certain relief provisions new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change significantly the tax laws with respect to an entitys qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of its reit qualification if host inc or its subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit and any available relief provisions did not apply the nonqualifying reit would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates moreover unless entitled to statutory relief the nonqualifying reit could not qualify as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which reit qualification was lost  to qualify as a reit host inc is required to satisfy several asset and gross income tests our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which assets are not susceptible to a precise determination of fair market value and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals our compliance with the reit gross income and quarterly asset test requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our gross income and assets on an ongoing basis accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not contend that our hotel leases interests in subsidiaries or interests in the securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the reit gross income and asset test requirements any determination that host inc or its subsidiary reit does not qualify as a reit will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce materially the value of host incs common stock the additional tax liability of host inc or the subsidiary reit for the year or years in which the relevant entity does not qualify as a reit would reduce its cash flow available for investment debt service or distributions to stockholders furthermore the entity not qualifying as a reit no longer would be required to make distributions to its stockholders as a condition to reit qualification and any distributions made to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary c corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that if host inc were to fail to qualify as a reit host incs stockholders currently taxed as individuals would be taxed on dividends at capital gain tax rates and host incs corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the code host incs failure to qualify as a reit also would cause an event of default under host lps credit facility which default could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due thereunder which in turn would constitute an event of default under host lps outstanding debt securities  if our hotel managers do not qualify as eligible independent contractors or if our hotels are not qualified lodging facilities host inc will fail to qualify as a reit each hotel with respect to which our trs pays rent must be a qualified lodging facility a qualified lodging facility is a hotel motel or other establishment more than onehalf of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient basis including  30    customary amenities and facilities provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who legally is authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility we believe that all of the hotels leased to our trs are qualified lodging facilities however the reit provisions of the code provide only limited guidance for making determinations of whether a hotel is considered a qualified lodging facility and there can be no assurance that our hotels will be so considered in all cases if our hotel managers do not qualify as eligible independent contractors host inc and our subsidiary reit likely will fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes each of the hotel management companies that enters into a management contract with our trs must qualify as an eligible independent contractor under the reit rules in order for the rent paid to us by our trs to be qualifying gross income for the reit gross income test requirements among other requirements in order to qualify as an eligible independent contractor a hotel manager cannot own more than 35 of our outstanding shares by value and no person or group of persons can own more than 35 of our outstanding shares and the ownership interests of the hotel manager taking into account only owners of more than 5 of our shares and with respect to ownership interests in such hotel managers that are publicly traded only owners of more than 5 of such ownership interests complex ownership attribution rules apply for purposes of these 35 ownership thresholds although we monitor ownership of our shares by our hotel managers and their owners and certain provisions of our charter are designed to prevent ownership of our shares in violation of these rules there can be no assurance that these ownership limits will not be exceeded the size of our trs is limited and our transactions with our trs will cause us to be subject to a 100 excise tax on certain income or deductions if such transactions are not conducted on armslength terms a reit may own up to 100 of the equity interests of an entity that is a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the entity is a trs a trs may hold assets and earn gross income that would not be considered as qualifying assets or as qualifying gross income if held or earned directly by a reit including gross operating income from hotel operations both the reit and its corporate subsidiary must jointly elect to treat such corporate subsidiary as a trs a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than 35 of the voting power or value of its stock automatically will be treated as a trs overall no more than 25 20 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 of the value of a reits assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trs in addition the trs rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit in order to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate income taxation our trs will pay federal income tax and applicable state and local income tax and if applicable foreign income tax on its taxable income its aftertax net income will be available for distribution to us but it is not required to be so distributed we believe that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of our trs has been and will continue to be less than 25 20 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 of the value of our total assets including our trs stock and securities furthermore we monitor the value of our investments in our trs for the purpose of ensuring compliance with trs ownership limitations there can be no assurance however that we will be able to comply with the 25 20 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 value limitation discussed above rent paid to us by our trs may not be based on net income or profits in order for such rents to qualify as rent from real property we receive percentage rent from our trs that is calculated based on the gross revenues of the hotels subject to leases  not on net income or profits if the irs determines that the rent paid pursuant to our leases with our trs are excessive the deductibility thereof by the trs may be challenged and we could be subject to a 100 excise tax on redetermined rent or redetermined deductions to the extent that such rent exceeds an armslength amount recently enacted legislation has expanded the items subject to this 100 excise tax for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2016 we believe that our rent and other transactions between our reits and their trs are based on armslength amounts and reflect normal business practices but there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with our belief despite the reit status of each of host inc and its subsidiary reit we remain subject to various taxes  notwithstanding host incs status as a reit host inc and our subsidiaries including our subsidiary reit are subject to federal state local and foreign taxes on their net income gross receipts and property in certain cases host lp is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes and any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc  risks relating to redemption of op units  a holder who offers its op units for redemption may have adverse tax consequences a holder who elects to redeem their op units will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as having sold the op units the sale of these units is a taxable event and the holder thereof will be treated as realizing an amount equal to the sum of 1 the  31    value of the common stock or cash the holder receives and 2 the amount of host lps nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units the gain or loss recognized by the holder of op units is measured by the difference between the amount realized by the holder and the holders tax basis in the op units redeemed which tax basis includes the amount of host lps nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units it is possible that the amount of gain andor the tax liability related thereto that the holder recognizes and pays could exceed the value of the common stock or cash that the holder receives  differences between an investment in shares of host inc common stock and host lp op units may affect redeemed holders of op units if a holder elects to redeem their op units we will determine whether the holder receives cash or shares of host incs common stock in exchange for the op units although an investment in shares of host incs common stock is substantially similar to an investment in host lp op units there are some differences these differences include form of organization management structure voting rights liquidity and federal and state income taxation some of which differences may be material to investors     item 1b  unresolved staff comments  we have received no written

claims however no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings we believe based on currently available information that the results of such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but might be material to our operating results for any particular period depending in part upon the operating results for such period we record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated     item 4   mine safety disclosures none     32    executive officers  in the following table we

we only report discontinued operations if a disposal represents a strategic shift no prior year restatements are permitted for this change in policy     38        item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report  overview  host inc operates as a selfmanaged and selfadministered reit that owns properties and conducts operations through host lp of which host inc is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99 of its common op units as of december 31 2016 the remainder of host lps common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lps daytoday management and control  host inc is the largest lodging reit in nareits composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotel properties as of february 20 2017 we own 96 hotels in the united states and internationally and have minority ownership interests in an additional 18 hotels through joint ventures in the united states europe and the asiapacific region these hotels are operated primarily under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry the majority are located in central business districts of major cities near airports and in resortconference destinations  our customers fall into three broad groups transient business group business and contract business which accounted for approximately 60 35 and 5 respectively of our 2016 room sales transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels therefore we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than trends in leisure demand for a discussion of our customer categories see   our customers  understanding our performance  our revenues and expenses our hotels are operated by thirdparty managers under longterm agreements pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel we provide operating funds or working capital which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages utilities property taxes and other hotellevel expenses we generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month which distribution reflects hotellevel sales less propertylevel operating expenses excluding depreciation  operations from our domestic portfolio account for approximately 97 of our total revenues and 3 relate to our international hotels the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue               of 2016revenues            rooms revenue occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue the business mix of the hotel group versus transient and retail versus discount business is a significant driver of room rates     64                             food and beverage revenue food amp beverage revenues consist of revenues from group functions which may include banquet revenue and audio and visual revenues as well as outlet revenues from the restaurants and lounges at our properties     30                             other revenue occupancy the nature of the property eg resort etc and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue such as attrition and cancellation parking golf course spa entertainment and other guest services this category also includes retail and apartment rental revenue     6      39    hotel operating expenses represent approximately 98 of our total operating costs and expenses the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses               of 2016operatingcosts andexpenses            rooms expense these costs include housekeeping reservation systems room supplies laundry services and front desk costs occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages as well as on the level of service and amenities that are provided     19                             food and beverage expense these expenses primarily include food beverage and the associated labor costs and will correlate closely with food and beverage revenues group functions with banquet sales and audio and visual components generally will have lower overall costs as a percentage of revenues than outlet sales     23                             other departmental and support expenses these expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenue such as parking golf courses spas entertainment and other guest services as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments sales and marketing repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs     28                             management fees base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels     5                             other propertylevel expenses these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes ground rent equipment rent and property insurance many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels     8                             depreciation and amortization expense this is a noncash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of past capital expenditures     15      the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations it also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items taken separately these costs represent approximately 56 of our hotel operating expenses  key performance indicators revenue per available room revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved revpar does not include food and beverage parking or other guest service revenues generated by the property although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues it is considered the key indicator of core revenues for many hotels  revpar changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels as well as incremental operating profit than do changes that are driven by average room rate for example increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues such as food and beverage revenue as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services utilities and room amenity costs revpar increases due to higher room rates however will not result in additional roomrelated costs with the exception of those charged as a percentage of revenue as a result changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in revpar caused by occupancy levels  in discussing our operating results we present revpar and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and which operations have been included in our consolidated results comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage or large scale capital improvements we also present revpar separately for our comparable consolidated domestic and international both on a nominal and constant dollar basis hotels as well as for our joint venture in europe we provide revpar results in constant currency due to the number of consolidated properties we have internationally and the effect that exchange rates have on our reporting we use constant currency because we believe it is useful to investors as it provides clarity on how the hotels are performing in their local markets for all other measures net income operating profit ebitda ffo etc our discussion refers to nominal us which is consistent with our financial statement presentation under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 40    we also evaluate the performance of our business through certain nongaap financial measures each of these nongaap financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues operating profit net income and earnings per share we provide a more detailed discussion of these nongaap financial measures how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in nongaap financial measures our nongaap financial measures include           nareit funds from operations ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share we use nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share as supplemental measures of companywide profitability nareit adopted ffo in order to promote an industrywide measure of reit operating performance we also adjust nareit ffo for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt acquisition costs and litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business           comparable hotel ebitda hotel ebitda measures propertylevel results before debt service depreciation and corporate expenses as this is a property level measure and is a supplemental measure of aggregate propertylevel profitability we use hotel ebitda and associated margins to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels           ebitda and adjusted ebitda earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is a supplemental measure of our operating performance and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits hotel owners who are not reits and other capitalintensive companies we also adjust ebitda for gains and losses related to real estate transactions impairment losses and litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business adjusted ebitda  summary of 2016

growth in average rates as the business mix shifted from higherrated corporate demand to lowerrated discount business during the first half of the year we also benefited from less disruption from renovations at several of our comparable properties at the same time supply growth exceeded historic cumulative average growth particularly in many of our major markets including new york houston and boston softening inbound travel from international markets due to the relative strength of the us dollar also put pressure on demand in our major markets these trends coupled with increased price transparency from online travel agencies have inhibited room rate growth revpar growth in 2016 was both rate and occupancy driven as room rates improved 10 on a constant us basis and occupancy improved 130 basis points to 785 group revenue increased 45 driven by a 21 increase in room nights coupled with a 24 increase in rates meanwhile transient demand was hampered by softening business travel and reduced international travel transient revenues increased 12 for the year driven by a 07 increase in average rate and a 05 increase in room nights sold  comparable revpar at our domestic portfolio increased 25 for the year driven by a 130 basis point improvement in occupancy and a 08 improvement in room rates los angeles washington dc and san diego led our domestic portfolio with revpar increases of 88 67 and 55 respectively driven by improvements in both occupancy and room rates in each of the markets our new york and houston markets lagged the portfolio with revpar decreases of 30 and 11 respectively during the year primarily due to the recent influx of new supply the impact of which will continue into 2017  on a constant us basis revpar at our comparable consolidated international hotels outperformed our portfolio in 2016 with an increase of 78 led by our latin american properties which recorded a 152 increase in revpar our rio de janeiro properties benefited from the 2016 olympics and paralympics while the jw marriott hotel mexico city also experienced strong improvement in average rate our canadian properties outperformed driven by increased group business in both calgary and toronto comparable revpar in constant euros for the unconsolidated euro jv properties decreased 20 for the year the decrease was due to slow economic growth and an uncertain political climate that reduced demand particularly at the joint ventures properties in brussels and paris where operations have yet to return to levels seen prior to the terrorist attacks in those cities  rooms total rooms revenues increased 08 for the full year reflecting the 27 increase in comparable revpar on a constant dollar basis partially offset by lost revenue from our 2016 and 2015 hotel dispositions and currency translation effects for our international  42    properties total room expenses decreased by 10 primarily reflecting hotel sales as well as our focus on cost controls comparable room revenues increased 29 for the full year while comparable room expenses increased only 14 as operators were able to drive profitability through improved productivity food and beverage food and beverage revenues increased 20 for 2016 reflecting the 17 increase at our comparable hotels the increase was driven primarily by growth in banquet and audio visual revenues which provide higher overall operating margins than outlet revenue as catered functions generally are more profitable total food and beverage expenses and comparable hotel food and beverage expenses increased a moderate 04 and 03 respectively which allowed for strong profitability growth  operating profit operating margins calculated based on gaap operating profit as a percentage of gaap revenues increased 80 basis points for the full year 2016 these operating margins are affected significantly by several items including dispositions depreciation and corporate expenses our comparable hotel ebitda margins which exclude these items also increased 80 basis points to 278 the improvements in both gaap operating profit margins and comparable hotel ebitda margins were driven by improvement in higher margin group business throughout the year coupled with increases in attrition and cancellation fees decreases in utility and insurance costs and the ability of our operators to improve productivity we have focused on improving productivity at some of our largest hotels over the past two years by initiating time and motion studies these studies have resulted in hotel managers establishing tighter labor model standards and improved and expanded forecasting tools which allow managers to more effectively schedule labor based on demand and to minimize excess staffing thereby reducing costs net income adjusted ebitda and adjusted ffo per diluted share net income for host inc increased 206 million in 2016 to 771 million due primarily to the improvements in operations a 158 million increase in gains on dispositions and a decrease in interest expense including a decrease of 41 million of debt extinguishment costs partially offset by an increase in income tax expense and a decline in equity in earnings of affiliates as the euro jv sold nine hotels in 2015 we also recorded a gain of 12 million for proceeds received for the disruption of operations at the new orleans marriott caused by the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill as a result host incs diluted income per common share improved 378 to 102 adjusted ffo per diluted share which excludes gains on dispositions debt extinguishment costs and other real estate transactions including depreciation increased 97 to 169 per share net income nareit and adjusted ffo and the related per share measures benefited from the following          adjusted ebitda increased 62 million to 1471 million reflecting improvement in hotel operations despite a net reduction due to property transactions including the european joint ventures 2015 hotel dispositions          per share measures improved due to the purchase of 52 million shares during 2016 and 2015 the antidilutive effect of these purchases is computed on a weighted average basis  the trends and transactions described above for host inc affected host lp as the only significant difference between the host inc and host lp statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the outside partners of host lp for the year host lps net income increased 206 million to 771 million and the diluted income per common unit increased 382 to 105 per common unit  2017 outlook  there is cautious optimism for the united states economy in 2017 in 2016 gdp growth slowed to approximately 16 while business investment declined slightly as uncertainty weighed on confidence and corporate demand however several economic indicators including improving corporate profitability and strengthening consumer confidence point to the potential for continued and possibly stronger growth this year additionally the new administration and congress have signaled or proposed several initiatives such as a decrease in corporate taxation lower regulatory burdens and an increase in infrastructure spending that may result in increased business investment although the timing of any increases remains uncertain at the same time there is an expectation that us monetary policy will tighten in 2017 leading to an increase in interest rates and further strengthening for the us dollar which could lead to continued softening of international travel to the united states  based on these trends we anticipate that us travel demand will remain stable in the nearterm strengthening consumer confidence and strong employment numbers have the potential to buoy the transient travel segment additionally demand for our  43    lodging portfolio of upperupscale properties in major markets is highly correlated to business investment which we anticipate will strengthen in 2017 however supply growth significantly accelerated in 2016 and this trend is expected to continue into 2017 in particular the markets in which we own a significant number of our hotels have experienced aboveaverage supply growth during this cycle the continued increase in supply will limit our managers ability to grow room rate in the nearterm and could lead to slight declines in occupancy additionally rate growth is inhibited by the increasing popularity of online sharing sites such as airbnb as well as online booking sites which increase price transparency as a result of these trends we anticipate that we will continue to experience high levels of occupancy in 2017 in january 2017 comparable revpar increased 74 for the month on a constant us dollar basis primarily driven by the performance of the washington dc market which benefited from the presidential inauguration and womens march however the continued pressures from increased supply are expected to inhibit rate growth leading to limited revpar improvement for the remainder of the year as a result we anticipate revpar growth for our comparable hotels on a constant dollar basis of between 00 and 20 for the full year 2017 additionally comparisons between our 2016 and 2017 results will be affected by our recent dispositions as in 2016 we recognized revenues of 166 million net income excluding gain on sale of 21 million and adjusted ebitda of 37 million for the ten properties sold in 2016 and one property sold yeartodate 2017 as noted above the current outlook for the lodging industry is uncertain therefore there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons including but not limited to slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns see part i item 1a risk factors strategic initiatives we have executed on nearly 500 million of asset dispositions in 2016 and another 172 million through february 20 2017 we also were able to complete several value enhancement redevelopment and return on investment initiatives the proceeds generated from our hotel dispositions coupled with cash from operations allowed us to distribute a total of 814 million to our stockholders through common dividends and common stock repurchases subsequent to year end we acquired the don cesar for 214 million  for 2017 we intend to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation to strengthen our portfolio and deliver stockholder value we intend to take advantage of our strong capital position and overall scale to acquire upperupscale luxury and highquality selectservice properties through single asset or portfolio acquisitions that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages to drive longterm value at the same time we will opportunistically sell assets we also continue to critically analyze our portfolio to take advantage of the inherent value of our real estate holdings for its highest and best use such as the 2016 acquisition of the ground lease at our key bridge marriott located along the potomac river overlooking washington dc we anticipate that the level of capital intensive redevelopment projects will decline compared to 2016 we intend to deliver value to our stockholders through a meaningful dividend and depending on market conditions may also execute on our recently authorized 2017 stock repurchase program while looking to maintain our investment grade rating  portfolio  acquisitions in july 2016 we purchased the ground lease at the key bridge marriott for 54 million the land is located along the potomac river overlooking washington dc and we currently are exploring further development and value enhancement opportunities for the asset on february 16

excellence by historic hotels of america with 347 rooms and suites along the florida gulf coast awardwinning dining options and over 38000 square feet of meeting space   dispositions we continue to strategically dispose of assets that we believe will experience lower growth andor higher capital expenditures requirements during 2016 we disposed of 10 properties for proceeds of approximately 467 million and recorded a gain on sale of 243 million since we announced our strategy to exit the asiapacific market in september 2015 we have sold all seven of our new zealand hotels for a total of

ecoefficiency of our hotels incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology capital expenditures have totaled approximately 27 billion

fund our capital expenditures programs and take advantage of investment opportunities  financing transactions  we executed successfully on our strategy to decrease our leverage as measured by our net debt to ebitda ratio and to reduce our debt service obligations leading to an increase in our interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and an investment grade rating for host lps senior

2016 we had a full year of operations for four hotels that had been closed for portions of 2015 for redevelopment conversely in 2015 our results were significantly more impacted by disruptive

performing domestic markets for the year were los angeles and washington dc our los angeles properties led our domestic portfolio with an overall revpar increase of 88 primarily due to rate growth of 56 as strong group demand enabled our operators to drive rate growth our washington dc market benefited year over year from the 2015 renovations and strong citywide group demand resulting in rate growth of 32 combined with a 250 basis point increase in occupancy  many of our other west coast markets also outperformed the portfolio including san diego hawaii and san francisco the mlb allstar game and comiccon led to an increase in citywide room nights and strong group business at our san diego properties at our hawaiian properties strong group and transient demand in the market due to a combination of the zika virus threat in the caribbean and south america terrorism concerns in europe and lower airfare prices all led to revpar growth of 47 revpar growth at our properties in san francisco was due solely to rate growth of 30 primarily due to super bowl demand earlier this year while occupancy remained flat as many of our properties were negatively impacted by the construction at the moscone convention center which will continue until 2018 the phoenix market was in line with our portfolio as average rate increased 28 and occupancy remained flat meanwhile in seattle revpar was affected negatively by rooms renovation at the w seattle where occupancy declined by 840 basis points and difficult comparisons to 2015 when the city hosted the us golf association open championship   in the southern and central us our atlanta chicago and denver markets outperformed our portfolio due to a combination of rate improvement and an increase in occupancy in atlanta and denver our properties benefited from a number of citywide events during the year while our chicago properties benefited from completed renovations and strong group demand meanwhile revpar at our florida and houston hotels underperformed our portfolio concerns over the spread of the zika virus contributed to declines in both group and leisure travel at our florida properties our houston properties continued to be affected by disruption in the oil markets and increasing market supply on the east coast our boston and new york hotels underperformed our portfolio in boston there were fewer citywide events with weakening demand from the financial services and pharmaceutical sectors in new york supply growth has continued to negatively impact our hotels as well as the strong us dollar resulting in a decline in european travel trends we expect to continue into 2017  on a constant dollar basis our international markets experienced revpar growth of 78 led by our latin american properties with double digit revpar growth of 152 due to the 2016 olympics and paralympics in brazil and the formula 1 and nfl events in mexico  comparable hotel sales by property type  the following

comparable hotel operating statistics   our airport properties led the portfolio for the year driven by a combination of strong rate growth of 32 and an increase in occupancy of 330 basis points in particular the newark airport had an increase in occupancy of 139 percentage points due to lower occupancy in 2015 when the hotel was completing renovations and westin los angeles airport had rate growth of 118 due to new crew business our suburban properties also outperformed the portfolio driven by rate growth of 34 as high occupancy levels in urban markets helped drive demand toward adjacent suburban markets improvements in occupancy at our urban properties resulted in revpar growth of 18 while average rate remained flat our resort properties outperformed the portfolio with rate growth of 23 and a slight increase in occupancy of 40 basis points driven by our california and hawaii resorts  53    hotel sales by business mix our customers fall into three broad categories transient group and contract business the information below is derived from business mix results from 88 comparable hotels for which 2016 and 2015 business mix information is available in 2016 overall revenue growth was due to both group and transient growth overall group revenues improved 45 compared to the prior year consisting of a 24 average room rate increase coupled with a 21 growth in group room nights sold our hotels were able to drive group business through higherrated association business which led to a 75 increase in revenue corporate group revenue increased 58 while government and leisure group declined 29 revenue from our transient business increased 12 reflecting an increase of 07 in average rate and 05 in room nights sold special corporate rooms declined 36 as weakness in corporate business travel resulted in a negative mix shift as operators replaced higher rated corporate business with lower rated business such as contract discount or government  54    2015 compared to 2014

presentation see comparable hotel operating statistics our west coast markets continued to perform well in 2015 as san francisco seattle los angeles and san diego all had revpar increases of between 8 and 93 our san diego properties led our domestic portfolio with a revpar increase of 93 as strong group demand allowed our operators to focus business towards the higherrated transient and group business leading to a 69 improvement in average daily rate similarly strong transient demand coupled with solid group business has allowed our operators to focus on higherrated transient customers in all of our west coast markets at our hawaiian properties average occupancy increased 45 percentage points due to strong group and transient demand while average rate declined 05  the boston market led our east coast markets as strong citywide demand coupled with successful property specific promotional campaigns led to increases in both transient and group demand conversely in new york new hotel supply coupled with a reduction  55    in international demand as a result of a strong dollar has led to a revpar decline of 17 revpar grew just 01 in our dc market due to the absorption of new supply a decline in citywide events during the second half of the year and significant renovation projects that were completed during the first half of 2015 at our grand hyatt washington and jw marriott washington dc in our south and central markets atlanta and florida outperformed the portfolio with revpar growth of 78 and 71 respectively in atlanta renovations completed last year at the westin buckhead atlanta and grand hyatt atlanta in buckhead led to strong rate growth in florida strong group demand led to the 59 rate improvement and average occupancy of approximately 74 the chicago market was generally inline with the portfolio during the first half of the year the market outperformed the portfolio driven by strong citywide demand however as the year progressed group demand declined leading our operators to rely on discounted transient business revpar for our houston properties declined 74 due to disruption in the oil markets during 2015 which significantly hampered demand as well as increasing market supply and the renovation at the houston marriott medical center hotel  on a constant dollar basis our international markets experienced revpar growth of 22 led by our latin america properties with revpar growth of 91 on a constant dollar basis as strong group demand and renovations completed in 2014 led to improvements at our mexico property while the jw marriott rio de janeiro benefited from the weak real during the year despite difficult comparisons to the world cup in 2014 our canadian properties in particular calgary were affected negatively by falling oil prices and disruption from renovations which led to a revpar decrease of 106 for 2015  comparable hotel sales by property type  the following table sets forth performance information for

suburban properties led the portfolio for the year with revpar growth of 78 driven by average rate growth of 66 continuing a trend from prior year high occupancy and average room rate in urban markets has helped to drive demand in adjacent suburban markets our airport properties experienced revpar growth of 64 driven by strong average rate growth at our west coast airport properties the revpar improvement at our resort properties of 49 was driven by a 33 increase in average rate and improvement in occupancy of 110 basis points our urban properties lagged the portfolio with a revpar increase of 12 average rate increase of 10 and a 20 basis point growth in occupancy our urban properties were affected negatively by weakness in the washington dc new york and houston markets  hotel sales by business mix  the information below is derived from business mix results from 86 comparable hotels for which 2015 and 2014 business mix information is available in 2015 overall revenue growth was due to both group and transient growth revenue from our transient business increased 40 reflecting an increase of 35 in average rate and a slight increase in room nights sold nonqualified discount transient room nights increased 93 while lowerrated special corporate and government segments decreased 26 overall group revenues improved 39 compared to the prior year consisting of a 29 average room rate increase coupled with a 09 growth in group room nights sold corporate group revenue growth of 58 and association group revenue growth of 39 was offset partially by government and leisure growth of 02 56    liquidity and capital resources  liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp the liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp are derived primarily from the activities of host lp which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations the incurrence of debt the issuance of op units or the sale of properties host inc is a reit and its only significant asset is the ownership of partnership interests of host lp therefore its financing and investing activities are conducted through host lp except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock proceeds from stock issuances by host inc are contributed to host lp in exchange for op units additionally funds used by host inc to pay dividends or to repurchase stock are provided by host lp therefore while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between host inc and host lp we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion applies both to host inc and host lp  overview we look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash debt and equity in order to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry we believe this strategy will result in a lower overall cost of capital allow us to complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions and will position us to manage potential declines in operations throughout the lodging cycle over the past several years we have decreased our leverage as measured by our net debttoebitda ratio and reduced our debt service obligations leading to an increase in our fixed charge coverage ratio  we intend to use available cash predominantly for acquisitions or other investments in our portfolio if we are unable to find appropriate investment opportunities we will consider other uses such as a return of capital through dividends or common stock repurchases the amounts of which will be determined by our operations and other market factors significant factors we review to determine the amount and timing of common stock repurchases include the current stock price compared to our determination of the underlying value of our assets current and forecast operating results and the completion of hotel sales  we have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt we have access to multiple types of financing as approximately 98 of our debt consists of senior notes and borrowings under our credit facility none of which are collateralized by specific hotel properties our senior unsecured debt is rated investment grade by moodys investor services fitch ratings and standard amp poors rating service which has allowed us to borrow capital at lower rates than previously achieved in 2016 we did not issue any senior notes or incur any mortgage debt and repaid 137 million of mortgage debt additionally only one of our hotels is encumbered by mortgage debt  57    we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our portfolio withstand declines in operating cash flow pay nearterm debt maturities and fund our capital expenditures programs we may continue to access the capital markets

lp our primary sources of cash include cash from operations proceeds from the sale of assets borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances assuming the exercise of credit facility extensions we have no significant debt maturities until 2019  capital resources we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth including acquisitions as a result the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure our financial flexibility including our ability to incur debt make distributions and make investments is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of such indebtedness which include among other things the allowable amounts of leverage interest coverage and fixed charges  if at any time we determine that market conditions are favorable after taking into account our liquidity requirements we may cause host lp to issue senior notes or debentures exchangeable for shares of host inc common stock given our total debt level and maturity schedule we also will continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time taking advantage of favorable market conditions in february 2017 host incs board of directors authorized repurchases of up to 250 million of senior notes and mortgage debt other than in accordance with its terms we may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases privately negotiated transactions a tender offer or in some cases through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and nareit ffo per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs in addition while we intend to use any available cash predominantly for acquisitions or other investments in our hotel portfolio to the extent we do not identify appropriate investments we may elect in the future to use available cash for other purposes including share repurchases subject to market conditions accordingly in light of our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets we may at any time subject to applicable securities laws be considering or be in discussions with respect to the repurchase or issuance of exchangeable debentures andor senior notes or the repurchase or sale of common stock any such transactions may subject to applicable securities laws occur simultaneously  58    we continue to explore potential acquisitions and anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from sales of properties but also potentially from equity offerings of host inc issuances of op units by host lp incurrence of debt available cash or advances under our credit facility given the nature of these transactions we can make no

relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential nonperformance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price we assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligation to determine the impact if any of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition we are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions access to our credit facility and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited our exposure with regard to our cash and the available capacity under the revolver portion of our credit facility is mitigated as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group

   senior notes the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issued by host lp to which we refer collectively as the senior notes indenture we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semiannually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above under the terms of our senior notes indenture our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of host lps unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host lp  pledges and guarantees under the senior notes indentures all host lp subsidiaries which guarantee host lp debt are required to similarly guarantee debt issuances under the indenture also to the extent the equity of any subsidiaries of host lp is pledged to secure borrowings under the credit facility such collateral likewise is required to secure senior note issuances under the senior notes indentures while the credit facility currently does not include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests such guarantees or pledges subsequently will be required in the event that host lps leverage ratio exceeds 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility as well as the senior notes issued under the senior notes indenture and certain hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility if triggered the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain us and canadian subsidiaries of host lp and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would not provide guarantees or pledges of equity interests further if at any time our leverage ratio falls below 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters or host lp has an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating such guarantees and pledges may be released  62    senior notes indenture covenants  covenants for senior notes issued after we attained an investment grade rating no senior notes were issued in 2016 on october 14 2015 we completed an underwritten public offering of 400 million aggregate principal amount of series f senior notes bearing interest at a rate of 45 per year due in 2026 the series f senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the february 1 2026 maturity date except at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium as set forth in the senior notes indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date  on may 15 2015 we completed an underwritten public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of series e senior notes bearing interest at a rate of 4 per year due in 2025 the series e senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the june 15 2025 maturity date except at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium as set forth in the senior notes indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date  the series e and f senior notes were issued under a new senior notes indenture and have covenants customary for investment grade debt primarily limitations on our ability to incur debt there are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends these senior notes have covenants similar to our series d senior notes but are different than the covenants applicable to our prior series of senior notes issued before we attained our investment grade rating under the terms of the series d e and f senior notes host lps ability to incur indebtedness is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions including the achievement of an ebitdatointerest coverage ratio of at least 15x by host lp as calculated this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on host lps consolidated statement of operations in addition the calculation is based on host lps pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to certain transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period other covenants limiting host lps ability to incur indebtedness include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65 of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values maintaining secured indebtedness of less than 40 of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150 of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured indebtedness of host lp and its subsidiaries so long as host lp maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture it may incur additional debt  we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants applicable to our series d e and f senior notes the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture for our series d e and f senior notes and our actual credit ratios as of december 31 2016              actual ratio        covenant requirement    unencumbered assets tests        526       minimum ratio of 150    total indebtedness

  covenants for senior notes issued before we attained an investment grade rating currently our senior notes have an investment grade rating from both moodys and standard amp poors as a result many of the restrictive covenants contained in the senior notes indenture and the supplemental indentures for our prior series of senior notes are not applicable as they do not apply for so long as such series of notes maintain an investment grade rating from both moodys and standard amp poors the following primary covenants continue to apply to our existing senior notes other than our series d e and f senior notes          restrict our ability to sell all or substantially all of our assets or merge with or into other companies and          require us to make an offer to repurchase the existing senior notes then currently outstanding upon the occurrence of a change of control if our senior notes are no longer rated investment grade by either or both of moodys and standard amp poors then the following covenants and other restrictions will be reinstated for our senior notes but will not apply to the series d e and f senior notes which have different covenants           our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions will be subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions including the achievement of an ebitdatointerest coverage ratio of at least 20x we will be able to make  63            distributions to enable host inc to pay dividends on its preferred stock if any under the senior notes indenture when our ebitdatointerest coverage ratio is above 17 to 10 this ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture applicable to our noninvestment grade senior notes based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility and amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan in order to establish the debt at fair value these amounts are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations          other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions would include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65 of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values excluding intangible assets and maintaining secured indebtedness and subsidiary indebtedness of less than 45 of adjusted total assets so long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture applicable to our existing senior notes we may make preferred or common op unit distributions and incur additional debt including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and make distributions when our senior notes no longer are rated investment grade we still will be permitted to incur certain types of debt including i credit facility debt ii refinancing debt iii up to 400 million of mortgage debt which proceeds would be used to repay debt under the credit facility and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount and iv up to 150 million of other debt we also will be permitted to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain host incs reit status          a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets based on undepreciated book values of not less than 125 of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other debt not secured by mortgages this coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or make distributions discussed above which consequences where we fall below the coverage level are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or make distributions but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture and          our ability to make distributions on redeem or repurchase our op units permit payment or distribution restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries sell assets enter into transactions with affiliates and create certain liens will be restricted the following summarizes the actual credit ratios for our senior notes other than the series d e and f senior notes as of december 31 2016 and the covenant requirements contained in the senior notes indenture that would be applicable at such times as our senior notes no longer are rated investment grade by either of moodys or standard amp poors even if we were to lose the investment grade rating we would be in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the senior notes indenture              actual ratio        covenant requirement    unencumbered assets tests        532       minimum ratio of 125    total indebtedness to total assets        19       maximum

because of differences in the calculation methodology between our series d series e and series f senior notes and our other senior notes our actual ratios as reported can be slightly different  exchangeable debentures in 2009 host lp issued 400 million of 2½ exchangeable senior debentures in october 2015 host lp gave notice that it would redeem all of its currently outstanding debentures at a cash redemption price of 100 of the principal amount plus accrued interest at the time the debentures were exchangeable and the exchange price was equivalent to a host inc share price of 1245 based on host incs then current stock price the exchange value of the debentures exceeded the cash redemption price and holders of all but 1 million of the debentures elected to exchange their debentures for shares of host inc common stock at the exchange value rather than receive the redemption price at par as a result we issued 32 million shares of host inc common stock upon exchange including 87 million of debentures that had elected to exchange in july 2015 and redeemed approximately 1 million of debentures for cash credit facility on september 10 2015 we entered into the third amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility with bank of america na as administrative agent jpmorgan chase bank na as syndication agent wells fargo bank na deutsche bank securities inc the bank of nova scotia the bank of new york mellon credit agricole corporate amp investment bank and goldman sachs bank usa as codocumentation agents and certain other agents and lenders the credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to 1 billion the revolver also includes a foreign currency  64    subfacility for canadian dollars australian dollars new zealand dollars japanese yen euros and british pound sterling and if available to the lenders mexican pesos of up to the foreign currency equivalent of 500 million subject to a lower amount in the case of new zealand dollar and mexican pesos borrowings the credit facility also provides a term loan facility of 1 billion which we have fully utilized a subfacility of up to 100 million for swingline borrowings in us dollars canadian dollars euros or british pounds sterling and a subfacility of up to 100 million for issuances of letters of credit host lp also has the option to increase the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit facility andor term loan facility of the credit facility by up to 500 million subject to obtaining additional loan commitments and satisfaction of certain conditions  the revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of june 2018 with the option for host lp to extend the term for two additional sixmonth terms subject to certain conditions including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties and 500 million of term loans have an initial scheduled maturity of june 2017 with an option for host lp to extend the term for two additional years subject to similar conditions a second 500 million of term loans will mature in september 2020  neither the revolving credit facility nor the term loans as applicable requires any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity the term loans otherwise are subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees and pledges of security interests in subsidiaries operational covenants financial covenants and events of default as discussed below  collateral and guarantees the credit facility does not currently include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests in our subsidiaries or any other security and the guarantees and pledges are required only in the event that host lps leverage ratio exceeds 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility as well as the notes outstanding under host lps senior notes indenture interest rate and currency hedges and certain other hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility even when triggered the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain us and canadian subsidiaries of host lp and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would provide neither guarantees nor pledges of equity interests further if at any time our leverage ratio falls below 60x for two consecutive fiscal quarters or host lp has an investment grade longterm unsecured debt rating such guarantees and pledges may be released  prepayments voluntary prepayments of revolver borrowings and term loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty the loans under the credit facility are required to be prepaid in the event that asset sales reduce adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values to below 10 billion if we do not reinvest the proceeds of those asset sales in new properties at december 31 2016 we have adjusted total assets as defined in our credit facility of 19 billion  financial covenants  the credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 725x our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 175x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 125x the financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility hence so long as there are no amounts outstanding thereunder and the term loans are repaid we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the revolver portion of the credit facility in the future if we were ever to regain compliance with the financial covenants these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period under the terms of the credit facility interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan in order to establish its fair value and noncash interest expense due to the implementation in 2009 of accounting standards relating to our exchangeable debentures all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations additionally total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a net debt concept pursuant to which cash and cash equivalents in excess of 100 million are deducted from our total debt balance  we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility as of december 31 2016              actual ratio        covenant requirement for all years    leverage ratio        24  x     maximum ratio of 725x    fixed charge coverage ratio        78  x     minimum ratio of 125x    unsecured interest coverage ratio 1        109  x     minimum ratio of 175x                         65        1  if at any time our leverage ratio is above 70x our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will be reduced to 15x  interest and fees we pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to libor plus a margin the margin ranges from 875 to 155 basis points depending on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating we also pay a facility fee ranging from 125 to 30 basis points depending on our rating and regardless of usage based on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating as of december 31 2016 we are able to borrow at a rate of libor plus 100 basis points and pay a facility fee of 20 basis points interest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to libor plus a margin ranging from 90 to 175 basis points depending on host lps unsecured longterm debt rating based on host lps longterm debt rating as of december 31 2016 our applicable margin on libor loans under the 2014 term loan is 1125 basis points our applicable margin on the 2015 term loan for libor loans is 110 basis points other covenants and events of default the credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 60x as currently is the case in particular at any time that our leverage ratio is below 60x we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures and the limitations on acquisitions investments dividends and distributions contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture to the extent applicable while our senior notes maintain an investment grade rating additionally the credit facilitys restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and distributions generally are consistent with our senior notes indenture these provisions under certain circumstances limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain host incs tax status as a reit  the credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature and provides that upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders commitments may be terminated in addition upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default all amounts due under the credit facility automatically will become due and payable and the lenders commitments automatically will terminate  mortgage and other debt as of december 31 2016 we had mortgage debt secured by one hotel which represents 1 of our total revenues in 2016 all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except in instances of fraud misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions

thereof was 392 million at december 31 2016 the mortgage debt related to the hotels owned by our euro jv contains operating covenants that could result in the joint venture being required to escrow

on common dividends generally is to distribute over time at least 100 of its taxable income which primarily is dependent on our results of operations as well as gains and losses on property sales host inc paid a  66    regular quarterly cash dividend of 020 per share and a special cash dividend of 005 per share on its common stock on january 17 2017 to stockholders of record as of december 30 2016 the 020 per share dividend represents host incs intended regular quarterly cash dividend for the next several quarters subject to board approval while host inc intends to use available cash predominantly for acquisitions or other investments in its portfolio to the extent that we do not identify appropriate investments we may elect in the future subject to market conditions to use available cash for other purposes such as common stock repurchases or increased dividends which dividends could be in excess of taxable income any special dividend would be subject to approval by host incs board of directors  funds used by host inc to pay dividends are provided through distributions from host lp as of december 31 2016 host inc is the owner of approximately 99 of host lps common op units the remaining common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners each op unit may be offered for redemption by the holders for cash or at the election of host inc host inc common stock based on the then current conversion ratio the current conversion ratio is 1021494 shares of host inc common stock for each op unit  investors should take into account the 1 noncontrolling position of host lp op units when analyzing dividend payments by host inc to its stockholders as these holders of op units share on a pro rata basis in amounts being distributed by host lp to holders of its corresponding op units for example if host inc paid a 1 per share dividend on its common stock it would be based on the payment of a 1021494 per common unit distribution by host lp to host inc
