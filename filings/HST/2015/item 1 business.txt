our hotel portfolio above for a discussion of our hotels      item 3   legal proceedings  in 2005 we initiated a lawsuit against keystonetexas property holding corporation keystone seeking a declaration that a provision of the ground lease for the property under the san antonio marriott rivercenter was valid and claiming that keystone had breached that lease provision keystone filed an amended counterclaim and later a third party claim alleging that we had tortiously interfered with keystones attempted sale of the property and that we slandered keystones title to the property  in 2010 we received an adverse jury verdict in the 166th judicial district court of bexar county texas the jury found that we tortiously interfered with the attempted sale by keystone of the land under the san antonio marriott rivercenter and awarded keystone 343 million in damages plus statutory interest in addition the jury found that we slandered keystones title to the property and awarded keystone 39 million in damages plus statutory interest keystone was only entitled to receive one of these damage awards the jury also awarded keystone 75 million in exemplary damages with respect to the second claim in 2011 a threejudge panel of the san antonio court of appeals issued its memorandum opinion denying our appeal of the trial courts final judgment  in 2012 we filed a petition for review in the texas supreme court on june 13 2014 the texas supreme court reversed the court of appeals judgment and host was no longer liable for the jury verdict and punitive damages award keystone requested a rehearing of the texas supreme courts decision but that motion was denied on october 3 2014 finalizing the texas supreme courts decision as a result in the third quarter of 2014 we reversed the 69 million loss contingency previously recorded related to this litigation and the initial adverse verdict in addition a courtordered bond of 25 million was released on october 17 2014 we are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business including but not limited to disputes involving hotellevel contracts employment litigation compliance with laws such as the americans with disabilities act tax disputes and other  29    general matters we are vigorously defending these claims however no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings we believe based on currently available information that the results of such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but might be material to our operating results for any particular period depending in part upon the operating results for such period we record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated     item 4  mine safety disclosures  not applicable        30    executive officers  in the following table we set forth certain information regarding those persons currently
