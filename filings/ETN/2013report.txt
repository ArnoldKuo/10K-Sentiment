realize all of the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of cooper or those benefits may take longer to realize than expectedeatons ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the cooper transaction will depend to a large extent on the companys ability to integrate the two businesses the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively would preclude realization of the full benefits expected the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among othersthe diversion of managements attention to integration mattersdifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the business of cooper with that of eatondifficulties in the integration of operations and systemsdifficulties in the assimilation of employeesdifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex companychallenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers andchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnelmany of these factors will be outside of eatons control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of eaton volatility of end markets

research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that eaton will continue to successfully introduce new products and servicesthe success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by eatons customers the companys businesses are affected to varying degrees by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles eaton may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production or marketing of new products and services which may prevent eaton from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market eatons ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to the companys results of operations and future growtheaton depends on the continued services and performance of key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly professionals with experience in its industry and business eaton cannot be certain that any of these individuals will continue his or her employment with the company a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart an inability to hire develop and retain a sufficient

the companys manufacturing facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strike war political unrest terrorist activity economic upheaval or public health concerns some of

recoverable upon indications of impairment assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group would be considered impaired when the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group are less than its carrying value determining asset groups and underlying cash flows requires the use of significant judgmentgoodwill and indefinite life intangible assetsgoodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated annually for impairment as of july 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis the company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis a qualitative analysis is performed by assessing certain trends and factors including projected market outlook and growth rates forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins discount rates industry data and other relevant qualitative factors these trends and factors are compared to and based on the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative assessment additionally goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate there may be a possible permanent loss of value goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is equivalent to eatons operating segments and based on the net assets for each segment including goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is assigned to each operating segment as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and for which discrete financial information is available and is the level which management regularly reviews the operating results goodwill impairment testing for 2012 and 2011 was performed by assessing certain qualitative trends and factors as described above these trends and factors were compared to and based on the assumptions used in the quantitative assessment performed in 2010 for 2012 and 2011 it is more likely than not that the fair value of eatons reporting units substantially exceeded the respective carrying amountindefinite life intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks the fair value of these assets are determined using a royalty relief methodology similar to that employed when the associated assets were acquired but using updated estimates of future sales cash flows and profitability for 2012 and 2011 the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets substantially

measured at fair value there have been no changes in the methodologies used at december 31 2012 and 2011common collective trusts  valued at the net unit value of units held by the trust at year end the unit value is determined by the total value of fund assets divided by the total number of units of the fund owned the equity investments in collective trusts are predominantly in index funds for which the underlying securities are actively traded in public markets based upon readily measurable prices fixed income securities  these securities consist of publicly traded united states and nonunited states fixed interest obligations principally corporate and government bonds and debentures the fair value of corporate and government debt securities is determined through thirdparty pricing models that consider various assumptions including time value yield curves credit ratings and current market prices the company verifies the results of trustees or custodians and evaluates the pricing classification of these securities by performing analyses using other thirdparty sources united states treasuries  valued at the closing price of each security real estate and equity securities  these securities consist of direct investments in the stock of publicly traded companies such investments are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded as such the direct investments are classified as level 1 cash equivalents  primarily certificates of deposit commercial paper and repurchase agreements registered investment companies  valued at the closing price of the exchange traded funds sharesother  primarily insurance contracts for international plans and also futures contracts and overthecounter options these investments are valued based on the closing prices of future contracts or indices as available on the bloomberg or similar service and private equity investments for additional information

allegations tax audits patent infringement personal injuries including asbestos claims antitrust matters and employmentrelated matters although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome or cost of these matters the company believes they will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statementsin december 2010 a brazilian court held that a judgment obtained by a brazilian company raysul against another brazilian company saturnia which was sold by eaton in 2006 could be enforced against eaton ltda this judgment is based on an alleged violation of an agency agreement between raysul and saturnia at december 31 2012 the company has a total accrual of 79 brazilian reais related to this matter 39 based on current exchange rates comprised of 60 brazilian reais recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010 30 based on current exchange rates with an additional 19 brazilian reais recognized through december 31 2012 9 based on current exchange rates due to subsequent accruals for interest and inflation the company expects that any sum it may be required to pay in connection with this matter will not exceed the amount of the recorded liability in 2010 eaton filed motions for clarification with the brazilian court of appeals which were denied on april 6 2011 eaton holding and eaton ltda filed appeals on various issues to the superior court of justice in brasilia all appeals have been accepted by the superior court of justice and will be heard in due courseon october 5 2006 zf meritor llc and meritor transmission corporation collectively meritor filed an action against eaton in the united states district court for delaware the action sought damages which would be trebled under united states antitrust laws as well as injunctive relief and costs the suit alleged that eaton engaged in anticompetitive conduct against meritor in the sale of heavyduty truck transmissions in north america following a four week trial on liability only on october 8 2009 the jury returned a verdict in favor of meritor eaton firmly believes that it competes fairly and honestly for business in the marketplace and that at no time did it act in an anticompetitive manner during an earlier stage in the case the judge concluded that damage estimates contained in a report filed by meritor were not based on reliable data and the report was specifically excluded from the case on november 3 2009 eaton filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and to set aside the verdict that motion was denied on march 10 2011 on march 14 2011 eaton filed a motion for entry of final judgment of liability zero damages and no injunctive relief that motion was denied on june 9 2011 on august 19 2011 the court entered final judgment of liability but awarded zero damages to plaintiffs the court also entered an injunction prohibiting eaton from offering rebates or other incentives based on purchasing targets but stayed the injunction pending appeal eaton appealed the liability finding and the injunction to the third circuit court of appeals meritor crossappealed the finding of zero damages on september 28 2012 the court of appeals affirmed the district courts denial of eatons motion for judgment as a matter of law and let stand the jury verdict in favor of meritor the third circuit also ruled that the plaintiffs damages report was properly excluded but reversed the judgment of zero damages and ordered that the district court must allow plaintiffs a limited opportunity to amend the damages report which may be reconsidered for reliability and admissibility injunctive relief also was vacated an estimate of any potential loss related to this action cannot be made at this time42table of contents environmental contingencieseaton has

groundwater contamination include precleanup activities such as fact finding and investigation risk assessment feasibility study design and action planning performance where actions may range from monitoring to removal of contaminants to installation of longerterm remediation systems and operation and maintenance of a remediation system the extent of expected remediation activities and costs varies by site a number of factors affect the cost of environmental remediation including the number of parties involved at a particular site the determination of the extent of contamination the length of time the remediation may require the complexity of environmental regulations and the continuing advancement of remediation technology taking these factors into account eaton has estimated the costs of remediation which will be paid over a period of years the company accrues an amount on an undiscounted basis consistent with the estimates of these costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred actual results may differ from these estimates at december 31 2012 and 2011 the company had an accrual totaling 125 and 62 respectively for these costsbased upon eatons

assets and liabilities that have been recognized for differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwardsmanagement evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates if the company experiences cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise however if the company experiences cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized these factors include historical operating results known or planned operating developments the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities tax law carryback capability in the particular country prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as the companys goodwill and other impairment testing after evaluation of these factors if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required to the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction management would establish a valuation allowanceapplying the above methodology valuation allowances have been established for certain united states federal state and local income as well as certain nonunited states deferred income tax assets to the extent they are not expected to be realized within the

fourth quarter of 2011 the irs issued a notice for eaton corporation and includible subsidiaries 2005 and 2006 tax years the notice proposes assessments of 75 in additional taxes plus 52 in penalties related primarily to transfer pricing adjustments for products manufactured in the companys facilities in puerto rico and the dominican republic and sold to affiliated companies located in the us net of agreed credits and deductions the company has set its transfer prices for products sold between these affiliates at the same prices that the company sells such products to third parties the notice was issued despite the irs having previously recognized the validity of the companys transfer pricing methodology by entering into two successive binding advance pricing agreements apas that approved and in fact required the application of the companys transfer pricing methodology for the ten year period of 2001 through 2010 for the years 2001 through 2004 the irs had previously accepted the transfer pricing methodology related to these apas after a comprehensive review conducted in two separate audit cycles on december 16 2011 immediately prior to the notice being issued the irs sent a letter to eaton corporation stating that it was canceling the apasthe company firmly believes that the proposed assessments are without merit the company also believes that it was in full compliance with the terms of the two apas and that the irss unilateral attempt to retroactively cancel these two binding contracts is also without merit and represents a breach of the two contracts on february 29 2012 the company filed a petition with the us tax court in which it asserted that the transfer pricing established in the two apa contracts meets the armslength standard set by the us income tax law that the transfer pricing the company has used is in full compliance with us income tax laws and accordingly that the two apa contracts should be enforced in accordance with their terms on june 11 2012 the company filed a motion for partial summary judgment with the us tax court asking the us tax court to find that the apas are binding contracts and that the irs has the burden of proving that it is entitled to cancel the apas on october 22 2012 a hearing on the partial summary judgment motion was held at the us tax court a decision on the motion is pending the company believes that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial statementsduring 2010 eaton corporation received a significant tax assessment in brazil for the

disclosed all steps of the transaction the tax assessment is under review at the second of three administrative appeals levels the first administrative appeal level made a 50 reduction in assessed penalties the company disagrees with the assessment and intends to litigate the matter if it is not resolved at the administrative appeals levels multiple outside advisors have stated that brazilian tax authorities are raising the issue for most clients with similar facts and that the matter is expected to require at least 10 years to resolve at this time management believes that final resolution of the assessment will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statementsnote 9eaton shareholders equityeaton was incorporated under the laws of ireland on may 10 2012 and became the

an orderly transaction between market participants fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability as a basis for considering such assumptions a fair value hierarchy is established which categorizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and level 3 unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions53table of contents a summary of financial instruments recognized at fair value and the fair value measurements used

fluctuations in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices the company uses various derivative and nonderivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps currency forward exchange contracts currency swaps and to a lesser extent commodity contracts to manage risks from these market fluctuations the instruments used by eaton are straightforward nonleveraged instruments the counterparties to these instruments are financial institutions with strong credit ratings eaton maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one counterparty and regularly monitors the credit rating of these institutions such instruments are not purchased and sold for trading purposes54table of contents derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and recognized as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets accounting for the gain or loss resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated and is effective as part of a hedging relationship and if so as to the nature of the hedging activity eaton formally documents all relationships between derivative financial instruments accounted for as designated hedges and the hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction this process includes linking derivative financial instruments to a recognized asset or liability specific firm commitment forecasted transaction or net investment in a foreign operation these financial instruments can be designated ashedges of the change in the fair value of a recognized fixedrate asset or liability or the firm commitment to acquire such an asset or liability a fair value hedge for these hedges the

from the derivative financial instrument is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to income in the same period when the gain or loss related to the net investment in the foreign operation is included in income the gain or loss from a derivative financial instrument designated as a hedge that is effective is classified in the same line of the consolidated statements of income as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item the change in fair value of a derivative financial instrument that is not effective as a hedge is immediately recognized in incomefor derivatives that are not designated as a hedge any gain or loss is immediately recognized in income the majority of derivatives used in this manner relate to risks resulting from assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and certain commodity contracts that arise in the normal course of businesseaton uses certain of its debt denominated in foreign currency to hedge portions of its net

due to the financing activities noted above and longterm debt totaling 1100 assumed by eaton in the acquisition of cooper additionally deferred tax liabilities increased 1582 to 2024 at december 31 2012 from 442 at december 31 2011 primarily associated with the deferred tax impacts of purchase price accounting adjustments made to coopers opening balance sheet for additional information related

of 416 compared to 1248 in 2011 operating cash flows in 2012 were primarily impacted by lower working capital requirements compared to 2011 and the absence of contributions to other postretirement benefits plans totaling 154 that were made in 2011 partially offset by lower net income in 2012net cash provided by operating activities was 1248 in 2011 a decrease of 34 compared to 1282 in 2010 operating cash flows in 2011 were primarily impacted by higher net income in 2011 which was more than offset by increased contributions to defined benefits plans particularly contributions of 154 to

an increase of 6172 compared to 800 in 2011 the increase in 2012 was principally due to usage of 6936 related to the acquisitions of businesses the largest of which was cooper partially offset by cash

expenditures in 2013 net cash used in investing activities decreased 212 to 800 in 2011 as compared to 1012 in 2010 the decrease was principally due to cash proceeds of 103 from the sale of shortterm investments compared to purchases of 392 in 2010 partially offset by higher capital expenditures in 2011 both of which were related to higher liquidity requirements as the company returned to growth from the depressed levels of 2009 investing cash flow usage included 325 related to the acquisitions of businesses the largest of which were internormen technology group e begerow gmbh amp co kg and

2012 an increase of 5861 compared to a use of cash of 381 in 2011 substantially all of the increase in 2012 was due to proceeds totaling 7156 from the issuance of 4900 senior notes a 1669 borrowing on the 675 billion capacity bridge facility and the private issuance of 600 notes which are more fully described above offsetting these increases were repayments on the bridge facility totaling 1000 and cash dividends paid totaling 512 net cash used in financing activities was 381 in 2011 an increase of 120 compared to a use of cash of 261 in 2010 the increase was primarily due to share repurchases of 343 in 2011 and an increase of 99 in cash dividends paid in 2011 to eaton ordinary shareholders partially offset by proceeds received from a 300 debt issuance completed by eaton during 2011 higher

the netdebttocapital ratio was 392 at december 31 2012 compared to 265 at december 31 2011 the increase reflected the combined effect during 2012 of the 7060 increase in total debt and the 7617

fair value of plan assets in the companys employee pension plans increased 1202 to 3855 at december 31 2012 the increase in plan assets was primarily due to better than expected return on assets

of contributions to certain other pension plans during 2013 the funded status of the companys pension plans at the end of 2013 and future contributions will depend primarily on the actual return on

future contributions could be materially higher or lower than in 2012 offbalance sheet arrangementseaton does not have offbalance sheet arrangements or financings with unconsolidated entities or other persons in the ordinary course of business the company leases certain real properties and equipment as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements critical accounting policiesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may involve the exercise of significant judgment for any estimate or assumption used there may be other reasonable estimates or assumptions that may have been used however based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions management believes it is unlikely that applying other such estimates and assumptions would have caused materially different amounts to have been reported actual results may differ from these estimates revenue recognition sales of products are recognized when a sales agreement is in place products have been shipped to unaffiliated customers and title has transferred in accordance with shipping terms the selling price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured all significant related acts of performance have been completed and no other significant uncertainties exist shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related costs in cost of products sold although the majority of the sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are also agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for sales recognition purposes and if so how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element for delivered elements sales are recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value fair values of undelivered elements are known there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights affecting the sales recognized for delivered elements sales for service contracts are generally recognized as the services are provided 71table of contents eaton records reductions to revenue for customer and distributor incentives primarily comprised of rebates at the time of the initial sale rebates are estimated based on sales terms historical experience trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served the rebate programs offered vary across businesses due to the numerous markets eaton serves but the most common incentives relate to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or other objectivesimpairment of goodwill and other longlived assets goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated annually for impairment as of july 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis the company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis a qualitative analysis is performed by assessing certain trends and factors including projected market outlook and growth rates forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins discount rates industry data and other relevant qualitative factors these trends and factors are compared to and based on the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative assessment additionally goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate there may be a possible permanent loss of value goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is equivalent to eatons operating segments and based on the net assets for each segment including goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is assigned to each operating segment as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and for which discrete financial information is available and is the level which management regularly reviews the operating results goodwill impairment testing for 2012 and 2011 was performed by assessing certain qualitative trends and factors as described above these trends and factors were compared to and based on the assumptions used in the quantitative assessment performed in 2010 for 2012 and 2011 it is more likely than not that the fair value of eatons reporting units substantially exceeded the respective carrying amountindefinite life intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks the fair value of these assets are determined using a royalty relief methodology similar to that employed when the associated assets were acquired but using updated estimates of future sales cash flows and profitability for 2012 and 2011 the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets substantially exceeded the respective carrying valuefor additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements longlived assets goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable events or circumstances that may result in an impairment review include operations reporting losses a significant adverse change in the use of an asset the planned disposal or sale of the asset a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors related to the asset or a significant decrease in the estimated fair value of an asset upon indications of impairment assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group would be considered impaired when the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group are less than its carrying value in instances where the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded the undiscounted cash flows the fair value of the asset group would be determined and an impairment loss would be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value determining asset groups and underlying cash flows requires the use of significant judgment recoverability of deferred income tax assets eaton is subject to the income tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine the income tax provision for financial statement purposes eaton must make significant estimates and judgments about its business operations in these jurisdictions these estimates and judgments are also used in determining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities that have been recognized for differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards 72table of contents management evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each jurisdiction in which it operates if the company experiences cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in a threeyear period including the current and prior two years management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise however if the company experiences cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in a threeyear period including the current and prior two years management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized these factors include historical operating results known or planned operating developments the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities tax law carryback capability in a particular country prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as the companys goodwill and other impairment testing after evaluation of these factors if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required to the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction management would establish a valuation allowance for additional information about income taxes see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements pension and other postretirement benefits plansthe measurement of liabilities related to pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans is based on several assumptions including interest rates expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates actual plan asset performance will either reduce or increase losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss which ultimately affects net income the discount rate for united states plans was determined by discounting the expected future benefit payments using a theoretical zerocoupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of highquality bonds as of the measurement date and solving for the single rate that generated the same benefit obligation only corporate bonds with a rating of aa or higher by either moodys investor services or standard amp poors were included callable bonds and certain other noncomparable bonds were eliminated finally a subset of bonds was selected by grouping the universe of bonds by duration and retaining 50 of the bonds that had the highest yields the discount rates for nonunited states plans were determined by region and are based on high quality longterm corporate and government bonds consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds to be used in determining the discount rate key assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement benefits expense are adjusted at each yearend a 1percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on pension plan assets is estimated to have approximately a 38 effect on pension expense likewise a 1percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a 63 effect on pension expense a 1percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on other postretirement benefits assets is estimated to have approximately a 1 effect on other postretirement benefits expense a 1percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a 4 effect on expense for other postretirement benefits plans additional information related to changes in key assumptions used to recognize expense for other postretirement benefits plans is found in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements environmental contingenciesas a result of past operations eaton is involved in remedial response and voluntary environmental remediation at a number of sites including certain of its currentlyowned or formerlyowned plants the company has also been named a potentially responsible party under the united states federal superfund law at a number of disposal sites a number of factors affect the cost of environmental remediation including the number of parties involved at a particular site the determination of the extent of contamination the length of time the remediation may require the complexity of environmental regulations and the continuing advancement of remediation technology taking these factors into account eaton has estimated the costs of remediation which will be incurred over a period of years the company accrues an amount on an undiscounted basis consistent with the estimates of these costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred at december 31 2012 and 2011 125 and 62 was accrued for these costs based upon eatons analysis and subject to the difficulty in estimating these future costs the company expects that any sum it may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters is not reasonably possible to exceed the recorded liability by an amount that would have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows73table of contents market risk disclosure on a regular basis eaton monitors thirdparty depository institutions that hold its cash and shortterm investments primarily for safety of principal and secondarily for maximizing yield on those funds the company diversifies its cash and shortterm investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities eaton also monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and suppliers to mitigate any adverse impact eaton uses derivative instruments to manage exposure to volatility in raw material costs currency and interest rates on certain debt instruments derivative financial instruments used by the company are straightforward and nonleveraged the counterparties to these instruments are financial institutions with strong credit ratings eaton maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one counterparty and regularly monitors the credit rating of these institutions see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about hedges and derivative financial instruments eatons ability to access the commercial paper market and the related cost of these borrowings is based on the strength of its credit rating and overall market conditions the company has not experienced any material limitations in its ability to access these sources of liquidity at december 31 2012 eaton had 2000 of longterm revolving credit facilities with banks in support of its commercial paper program it has no direct borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities eatons nonunited states operations also had available shortterm lines of credit of approximately 2099 at december 31 2012 interest rate risk can be measured by calculating the shortterm earnings impact that would result from adverse changes in interest rates this exposure results from shortterm debt which includes commercial paper at a floating interest rate longterm debt that has been swapped to floating rates and money market investments that have not been swapped to fixed rates based upon the balances of investments and floating rate debt at year end 2012 a 100 basispoint increase in shortterm interest rates would have increased the companys net pretax interest expense by 15 eaton also measures interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of the companys financial liabilities would change as a result of movements in interest rates based on eatons best estimate for a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2012 the market value of the companys debt and interest rate swap portfolio in aggregate would increase by 779currency risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in exchange rates the company mitigates currency risk by funding some investments in certain markets through local currency financings nonunited states dollar debt was 148 at december 31 2012 to augment eatons nonunited states dollar debt portfolio the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and currency swaps from time to time to mitigate the risk of economic loss in its investments at december 31 2012 the aggregate

company receives from the swap compared to the floating interest rate the company pays on the swap purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business these amounts include commitments for purchases of raw materials outstanding noncancelable purchase orders releases under blanket purchase orders and commitments under ongoing service arrangements other

to receive disbursement at a later date the table above does not include future expected pension benefit payments or expected other postretirement benefits payments information related to the amounts of these future payments is described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements the table above also excludes the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits since the company cannot
