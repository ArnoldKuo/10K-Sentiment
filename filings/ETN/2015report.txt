date the consolidated financial statements were filed with the securities exchange commissionthe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of eaton and all subsidiaries and other entities it controls intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated the equity method of accounting is used for investments in associate companies where the company has significant influence and generally a 20 to 50 ownership interest equity investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the book value of the investment exceeds fair value an impairment would exist if there is an otherthantemporary decline in value these associate companies are not material either individually or in the aggregate to eatons consolidated financial statements eaton does

shipped to unaffiliated customers and title has transferred in accordance with shipping terms the selling price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured all significant related acts of performance have been completed and no other significant uncertainties exist shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related costs in cost of products sold although the majority of the sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for recognition purposes and if so how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element for delivered elements sales generally are recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are providedeaton records reductions to revenue for customer and distributor incentives primarily comprised of rebates at the time of the initial sale rebates are estimated based on sales terms historical experience trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served the rebate programs offered vary across businesses due to the numerous markets eaton serves but the most common incentives relate to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels 24table of contentsgoodwill and indefinite life intangible assetsgoodwill is evaluated annually for impairment as of july 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is equivalent to eatons operating segments and based on the net assets for each segment including goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is assigned to each operating segment as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and is the level at which management regularly reviews the operating results the company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis additionally goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate there may be a possible permanent loss of value goodwill impairment testing for 2014 was performed using a qualitative analysis which is performed by assessing certain trends and factors including projected market outlook and growth rates forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins discount rates industry data and other relevant qualitative factors these trends and factors are compared to and based on the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative assessment the results of the qualitative analysis did not indicate a need to perform a quantitative analysisgoodwill impairment testing for 2013 was performed using a quantitative analysis under which the fair value for each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model which considered forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital the forecasted cash flows were based on the companys longterm operating plan and a terminal value was used to estimate the operating segments cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise these analyses require the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows of the respective reporting unit sensitivity analyses were performed in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values for 2014 and 2013 based on a qualitative and quantitative analysis respectively the fair values of eatons reporting units continue to substantially exceed the respective carrying amountsindefinite life intangible assets consist of trademarks they are evaluated annually for impairment as of july 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis to determine whether their fair values exceed their respective carrying amounts indefinite life intangible asset impairment testing for 2014 and 2013 was performed using a quantitative analysis the company determines the fair value of these assets using a royalty relief methodology similar to that employed when the associated assets were acquired but using updated estimates of future sales cash flows and profitability for 2014 and 2013 the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets substantially exceeded the respective carrying valuefor additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets see note 4other longlived assetsdepreciation and amortization for property plant and equipment and

expense as appropriate cost of buildings are depreciated generally over 40 years and machinery and equipment over 3 to 10 years at december 31 2014 the weightedaverage amortization period for intangible assets subject to amortization was 17 years for patents and technology primarily as a result of the long life of aircraft platforms 17 years for customer relationships and 16 years for trademarks software is amortized up to a maximum life of 10 yearsother longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable upon indications of impairment assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group would be considered impaired when the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group are less than its carrying value determining asset groups

remediation including the number of parties involved at a particular site the determination of the extent of contamination the length of time the remediation may require the complexity of environmental regulations and the continuing advancement of remediation technology taking these factors into account eaton has estimated the costs of remediation which will be paid over a period of

the lower tax rate in 2014 was primarily attributable to the net tax benefit of 76 for the meritor and triumph litigation settlements and related legal costs and the gain on the sale of the aerospace businesses all of which occurred in the second quarter of 2014 excluding the previously mentioned litigation settlements and gain on the sale of businesses the 2014 income tax rate increased from 2013 due to greater levels of income in higher tax jurisdictions and net increases in worldwide tax liabilities partially offset by additional foreign tax credit recognition in the united states and recognition of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions the lower effective tax rate for 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to the effects associated with the acquisition of cooper along with greater levels of income in lower tax jurisdictions additional foreign tax credit utilization and the benefit of two years of the us research and experimentation tax credit due to the extension of the credit in the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the act as signed into law in january 2013 the act extended certain tax benefits retroactively to january 1 2012 see note 7 and note

experiences cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise however if the company experiences cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized these factors include historical operating results known or planned operating developments the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities tax law carryback capability in the particular country prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as those used for the companys goodwill and other impairment testing after evaluation of these factors if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required to the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction management would establish a valuation

interest and penalties which are not included in the table of unrecognized income tax benefits above eaton recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in the provision for income tax expense the company has accrued penalties in jurisdictions where they are automatically applied to any deficiency regardless of the merit of the positionthe resolution of the majority of eatons unrecognized income tax benefits is dependent upon uncontrollable factors such as the prospect of retroactive regulations new case law the willingness of the income tax authority to settle the issue including the timing thereof and other factors therefore for the majority of unrecognized income tax benefits it is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in the

its transfer prices for products sold between these affiliates at the same prices that the company sells such products to third parties as required by two successive advance pricing agreements apas the company entered into with the irs for the years 2001 through 2004 the irs had previously accepted the transfer pricing methodology related to these apas after a comprehensive review conducted in two separate audit cycles on december 16 2011 immediately prior to the 2011 notice being issued the irs sent a letter stating that it was retrospectively canceling the apas even though their respective apa terms had already expired the company is contesting the proposed assessments the company believes that it was in full compliance with the terms of the two apas and that the irss cancellation of these two apas is without merit on february 29 2012 the company filed a petition with the us tax court in which it asserted that the transfer pricing established in the apas meets the armslength standard set by the us income tax laws and accordingly that the apas should be enforced in accordance with their terms the case involves both whether the apas should be enforced and if not the appropriate transfer pricing methodology the us tax court has established that the trial for this matter will begin in june 2015 during the third quarter of 2014 the company received a notice from the irs for the 2007 through 2010 tax years the 2014 notice proposing assessments of 190 in additional taxes plus 72 in penalties net of agreed credits and deductions the proposed assessments pertain primarily to the same transfer pricing issues that are currently in litigation for the 2011 notice as noted above during 2007 through 2010 the company set its transfer prices for products sold between these affiliates consistent with the terms of a written apa between it and the irs that covered the years at issue to establish the relevant transfer prices the apa relied on prices at which the company sells the products to third parties the 2014 notice includes a separate proposed assessment involving the recognition of income for several of the companys controlled foreign corporations the company believes that these proposed assessments are without merit on november 25 2014 the company filed a petition with the us tax court in which it challenged the irss adjustments the company expects the outcome of the 2014 notice on the transfer pricing matter to be determined by the judicial decision related to the 2011 notice the company has continued to apply the armslength transfer pricing methodology for 2011 through 2014also during the third quarter of 2014 the company resolved an uncertain tax position with a european government the resolution had minimal impact on the companys consolidated statements of incomeduring 2010 the company received a tax assessment of 64 plus interest and penalties in brazil for the tax years 2005 through 2008 that relates to the amortization of certain goodwill generated from the acquisition of thirdparty businesses and corporate reorganizations the company is contesting the assessment which is under review at the second of three administrative appeals levels during 2013 the brazilian tax authorities began an audit of tax years 2009 through 2012 during the third quarter of 2014 the company received a tax assessment of 50 plus interest and penalties for the 2009 through 2012 tax years primarily relating to the same issues concerning the 2005 through 2008 tax years which the company is also contesting and is under review in the administrative appeals process multiple outside advisors have stated that brazilian tax authorities are raising the issue for most clients with similar facts and that the matter is expected to require at least 10 years to resolve the company continues to believe that final resolution of the assessments will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

measurementsfair value is measured based on an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to satisfy a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability as a basis for considering such assumptions a fair value hierarchy is established which categorizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and level 3 unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting

partially offset by the continued impact of global uncertainty about future growth this resulted in soft end markets and subdued economic growth for the majority of 2013 the growth experienced in 2012 was impacted by economic and political uncertainties in europe china and the united states due to the continued uncertainty about future growth among other factors the company undertook certain restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2012 which resulted in charges totaling 50 during 2014 the companys results of operations were impacted by modest growth in the companys end markets particularly in north america this was partially offset by the impact of settlement of two litigation matters with zf meritor llc and meritor transmission corporation collectively meritor and triumph actuation systems llc and other claimants collectively triumph for 500 and 1475 respectively and the sale of the aerospace power distribution management solutions and integrated cockpit solutions businesses to safran for 270 which resulted in a pretax gain of 154 also during the second half of 2014 the companys results of operations were negatively impacted by shifts in currency exchange rates

rate in 2014 was primarily attributable to the net tax benefit of 76 for the meritor and triumph litigation settlements and related legal costs and the gain on the sale of the aerospace businesses all of which occurred in the second quarter of 2014 excluding the previously mentioned litigation settlements and gain on the sale of businesses the 2014 income tax rate increased from 2013 due to greater levels of income in higher tax jurisdictions and net increases in worldwide tax liabilities partially offset by additional foreign tax credit recognition in the united states and recognition of

have been completed and no other significant uncertainties exist shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related costs in cost of products sold although the majority of the sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for recognition purposes and if so how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element for delivered elements sales generally are recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value

performed by assessing certain trends and factors that require significant judgment including projected market outlook and growth rates forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins discount rates industry data and other relevant qualitative factors these trends and factors are compared to and based on the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative assessment the results of the qualitative analysis did not indicate a need to perform a quantitative analysisgoodwill impairment testing for 2013 was performed using a quantitative analysis under which the fair value for each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model which considered forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital the forecasted cash flows were based on the companys longterm operating plan and a terminal value was used to estimate the operating segments cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise these analyses require the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows of the respective reporting unit sensitivity analyses were performed in order to assess

estimates and judgments about its business operations in these jurisdictions these estimates and judgments are also used in determining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities that have been recognized for differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each jurisdiction in which it operates if the company experiences cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in a threeyear period including the current and prior two years management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise however if the company experiences cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in a threeyear period including the current and prior two years management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized these factors include historical operating results known or planned operating developments the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities tax law carryback capability in a particular country prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as the companys goodwill and other impairment testing after evaluation of these factors if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country

rates return on plan assets rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates actual plan asset performance will either reduce or increase losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss which ultimately affects net income the discount rate for united states plans was determined by discounting the expected future benefit payments using a theoretical zerocoupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of highquality bonds as of the measurement date and solving for the single rate that generated the same benefit obligation only corporate bonds with a rating of aa or higher by either moodys or standard amp poors were included callable bonds and certain other noncomparable bonds were eliminated finally a subset of bonds was selected by grouping the universe of bonds by duration and retaining 50 of the bonds that had the highest yields the discount rates for nonunited states plans were determined by region and are based on high quality longterm corporate and government bonds consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds to be used in determining the discount rate key assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement benefits expense are adjusted at each yearend a 1percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on pension plan assets is estimated to have approximately a 43 effect on pension expense likewise a 1percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a 75 effect on pension expense a 1percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on other postretirement benefits assets is estimated to have approximately a 1 effect on other postretirement benefits expense a 1percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a 4 effect on expense for other postretirement benefits plans additional information related to changes in key assumptions used to recognize expense for other postretirement

rates based upon the balances of investments and floating rate debt at year end 2014 a 100 basispoint increase in shortterm interest rates would have increased the companys net pretax interest expense by 32 eaton also measures interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of the companys financial liabilities would change as a result of movements in interest rates based on eatons best estimate for a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2014 the market value of the companys debt and interest rate swap portfolio in aggregate would increase by 494the company is exposed to currency risk associated with translating its functional currency financial statements into its reporting currency which is the us dollar as a result the
