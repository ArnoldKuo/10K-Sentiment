systems and services for power quality distribution and control power transmission lighting and wiring hydraulics components systems and services for industrial and mobile equipment aerospace fuel hydraulics and pneumatic systems for commercial and military use and truck and automotive drivetrain and powertrain systems for performance fuel economy and safety eaton has approximately 102000 employees in over 60 countries and sells products to customers in more than 175 countriesthe consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes actual results could differ from these estimates management has evaluated subsequent events through the date the consolidated financial statements were filed with the securities exchange commissionthe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of eaton and all subsidiaries and other controlled entities intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated the equity method of accounting is used for investments in associate companies where the company has a 20 to 50 ownership interest equity investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the book value of the investment exceeds fair value an impairment would exist if there is an otherthantemporary decline in value these associate companies are not material either individually or in the aggregate to eatons consolidated financial statements eaton does not have offbalance sheet arrangements or financings with unconsolidated entities in the ordinary course of business the company leases certain real properties and equipment as described in note 7eatons functional currency is united states dollars usd the functional currency for most subsidiaries is their local currency financial statements for these subsidiaries are translated at yearend exchange rates as to assets and liabilities and weightedaverage exchange rates as to revenues and expenses the resulting translation adjustments are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentationrevenue recognitionsales of products are recognized when a sales agreement is in place products have been shipped to unaffiliated customers and title has transferred in accordance with shipping terms the selling price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured all significant related acts of performance have been completed and no other significant uncertainties exist shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related costs in cost of products sold although the majority of the sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for recognition purposes and if so how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element for delivered elements sales are recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value fair values of undelivered elements are known there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights affecting the sales recognized for delivered elements sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are providedeaton records reductions to revenue for customer and distributor incentives primarily comprised of rebates at the time of the initial sale rebates are estimated based on sales terms historical experience trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served the rebate programs offered vary across businesses due to the numerous markets eaton serves but the most common incentives relate to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels 24table of contentslonglived assetsdepreciation and amortization for property plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are generally computed by the straightline method and included in cost of products sold selling and administrative expense and research and development expense as appropriate cost of buildings are depreciated generally over 40 years and machinery and equipment over 3 to 10 years at december 31 2013 the weightedaverage amortization period for intangible assets subject to amortization was 17 years for patents and technology primarily as a result of the long life of aircraft platforms and 16 years for customer relationships software is amortized up to a maximum life of 10 yearslonglived assets except goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable upon indications of impairment assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group would be considered impaired when the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group are less than its carrying value determining asset groups and underlying cash flows requires the use of significant judgmentgoodwill and indefinite life intangible assetsgoodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated annually for impairment as of july 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is equivalent to eatons operating segments and based on the net assets for each segment including goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is assigned to each operating segment as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and is the level at which management regularly reviews the operating results the company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis goodwill impairment testing for 2013 was performed using a quantitative analysis under which the fair value for each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model which considered forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital the forecasted cash flows were based on the companys longterm operating plan and a terminal value was used to estimate the operating segments cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise these analyses require the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows of the respective operating segment sensitivity analyses were performed around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values for 2013 based on a quantitative analysis the fair values of eatons reporting units continue to substantially exceed the respective carrying amountsa qualitative analysis is performed by assessing certain trends and factors including projected market outlook and growth rates forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins discount rates industry data and other relevant qualitative factors these trends and factors are compared to and based on the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative assessment additionally goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate there may be a possible permanent loss of value indefinite life intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks the fair value of these assets are determined using a royalty relief methodology similar to that employed when

for which the underlying securities are actively traded in public markets based upon readily measurable prices fixed income securities  these securities consist of publicly traded united states and nonunited states fixed interest obligations principally corporate and government bonds and debentures the fair value of corporate and government debt securities is determined through thirdparty

estimates and judgments are also used in determining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities that have been recognized for differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwardsmanagement evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates if the company experiences cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise however if the company experiences cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized these factors include historical operating results known or planned operating developments the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities tax law carryback capability in the particular country prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as the companys goodwill and other impairment testing after evaluation of these factors if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required to the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction management would establish a valuation allowanceapplying the above methodology valuation allowances have been established for certain deferred income tax assets to the extent they are not expected to be realized within the particular tax

recognized the net impact on the provision for income tax expense would be 371as of december 31 2013 and 2012 eaton had accrued approximately 114 and 99 respectively for the payment of worldwide interest and penalties eaton recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in the provision for income tax expense the company has accrued penalties in jurisdictions where they are automatically applied to any deficiency regardless of the merit of the positionthe resolution of the majority of eatons unrecognized income tax benefits is dependent upon uncontrollable factors such as law changes the prospect of retroactive regulations new case law the willingness of the income tax authority to settle the issue including the timing thereof and other factors

to examinations for years before 2008at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011 the irs issued a notice for eaton corporation and includible subsidiaries 2005 and 2006 tax years the notice proposes assessments of 75 in additional taxes plus 52 in penalties related primarily to transfer pricing adjustments for products manufactured in the companys facilities in puerto rico and the dominican republic and sold to affiliated companies located in the us net of agreed credits and deductions the company has set its transfer prices for products sold between these affiliates at the same prices that the company sells such products to third parties the notice was issued despite the irs having previously recognized the validity of the companys transfer pricing methodology by entering into two successive advance pricing agreements apas that approved and in fact required the application of the companys transfer pricing methodology for the ten year period of 2001 through 2010 for the years 2001 through 2004 the irs had previously accepted the transfer pricing methodology related to these apas after a comprehensive review conducted in two separate audit cycles on december 16 2011 immediately prior to the notice being issued the irs sent a letter stating that it was retrospectively canceling the apas even though their respective apa terms had already expiredthe company firmly believes that the proposed assessments are without merit the company also believes that it was in full compliance with the terms of the two apas and that the irss unilateral attempt to retroactively cancel these two apas is also without merit and represents a breach of the two agreements on february 29 2012 the company filed a petition with the us tax court in which it asserted that the transfer pricing established in the two apa contracts meets the armslength standard set by the us income tax laws and accordingly that the two apa contracts should be enforced in accordance with their terms on june 11 2012 the company filed a motion for partial summary judgment with the us tax court asking the us tax court to find that the apas are binding contracts and that the irs has the burden of proof to substantiate cancellation of the apas on june 26 2013 the us tax court ruled that the irs has the discretion to unilaterally cancel an apa and that the taxpayer bears the burden of proving that the irs abused that discretion while the company disagrees with the tax courts ruling the company remains confident that it will be able to demonstrate that it was in full compliance with the apas and that the irs abused its discretion in canceling the apas after their terms expired in addition the company continues to believe the transfer pricing methodology contained in the apas is correct and that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 46table of contentsduring 2013 the us tax court approved the companys motion to depose the outside expert hired by the irs whose report was the sole basis underlying the notice as a result of statements made by the expert during the deposition the company determined that the irs expert either failed to consider or improperly applied the principles of internal revenue code section 482 including four treasury regulations that impacted the experts analysis as a result the company filed a motion for partial summary judgment asking the us tax court to invalidate the notice this motion is currently pending before the us tax court in addition the irs filed a separate motion asking the us tax court to divide the overall matter into two separate trials one involving the apa issue and the other involving the transfer pricing issue the company is opposed to separating the trials this motion is also pending before the us tax court during 2010 eaton corporation received a significant tax assessment in brazil for the tax years 2005 through 2008 that relates to the amortization of certain goodwill generated from the acquisition of thirdparty businesses and corporate reorganizations in this jurisdiction the company had previously filed and received a favorable tax ruling on the key aspects of the transaction not specifically covered by the plain meaning of the local tax statutes the ruling request fully disclosed all steps of the transaction the tax assessment is under review at the second of three administrative appeals levels the first administrative appeal level made a 50 reduction in assessed penalties the company disagrees with the assessment and intends to litigate the matter if it is not resolved at the administrative appeals levels multiple outside advisors have stated that brazilian tax authorities are raising the issue for most clients with similar facts and that the matter is expected to require at least 10 years to resolve during 2013 the brazilian tax authorities began an audit of tax years 2009 through 2012 at this time management believes that final resolution of the assessment will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements note 9eaton shareholders equitythere are 750 million eaton

representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to satisfy a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability as a basis for considering such assumptions a fair value hierarchy is established which categorizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and level 3 unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions 51table of

currency exchange rates and commodity prices the company uses various derivative and nonderivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps currency forward exchange contracts currency swaps and to a lesser extent commodity contracts to manage risks from these market fluctuations the instruments used by eaton are straightforward nonleveraged instruments the counterparties to these instruments are financial institutions with strong credit ratings eaton maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one counterparty and regularly monitors the credit rating of these institutions such instruments are not purchased and sold for trading purposes 52table of contentsderivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and recognized as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets accounting for the gain or loss resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated and is effective as part of a hedging relationship and if so as to the nature of the hedging activity eaton formally documents all relationships between derivative financial instruments accounted for as designated hedges and the hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction this process includes linking derivative financial

are not designated as a hedge any gain or loss is immediately recognized in income the majority of derivatives used in this manner relate to risks resulting from assets or liabilities denominated in a

make certain estimates and assumptions that may involve the exercise of significant judgment for any estimate or assumption used there may be other reasonable estimates or assumptions that may have been used however based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions management believes it is unlikely that applying other such estimates and assumptions would have caused materially different amounts to have been reported actual results may differ from these estimates revenue recognition sales of products are recognized when a sales agreement is in place products have been shipped to unaffiliated customers and title has transferred in accordance with shipping terms the selling price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured all significant related acts of performance have been completed and no other significant uncertainties exist shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related costs in cost of products sold although the majority of the sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for recognition purposes and if so how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element for delivered elements sales are recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value fair values of undelivered elements are known there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customernegotiated refund or return

distributor incentives primarily comprised of rebates at the time of the initial sale rebates are estimated based on sales terms historical experience trend analysis and projected market conditions in

for achieving defined volume levelsimpairment of goodwill and other longlived assets goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated annually for impairment as of july 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is equivalent to eatons operating segments and based on the net assets for each segment including goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is assigned to each operating segment as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and is the level at which management regularly reviews the operating results the company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis  74table of contentsgoodwill impairment testing for 2013 was performed using a quantitative analysis under which the fair value for each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model which considered forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital the forecasted cash flows were based on the companys longterm operating plan and a terminal value was used to estimate the operating segments cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise these analyses require the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows of the respective operating segment sensitivity analyses were performed around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values for 2013 based on a quantitative analysis the fair values of eatons reporting units continue to substantially exceed the respective carrying amountsa qualitative analysis is performed by assessing certain trends and factors including projected market outlook and growth rates forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins discount rates industry data and other relevant qualitative factors these trends and factors are compared to and based on the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative assessment additionally goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate there may be a possible permanent loss of value indefinite life intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks the fair value of these assets are determined using a royalty relief methodology similar to that employed when the associated assets were acquired but using updated estimates of future sales cash flows and profitability for 2013 and 2012 the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets substantially exceeded the respective carrying valuefor additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements longlived assets goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable events or circumstances that may result in an impairment review include operations reporting losses a significant adverse change in the use of an asset the planned disposal or sale of the asset a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors related to the asset or a significant decrease in the estimated fair value of an asset upon indications of impairment assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group would be considered impaired when the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group are less than its carrying value in instances where the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded the undiscounted cash flows the fair value of the asset group would be determined and an impairment loss would be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value determining asset groups and underlying cash flows requires the use of significant judgment recoverability of deferred income tax assetseaton is subject to the income tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine the income tax provision for financial statement purposes eaton must make significant estimates and judgments about its business operations in these jurisdictions these estimates and judgments are also used in determining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities that have been recognized for differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each jurisdiction in which it operates if the company experiences cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in a threeyear period including the current and prior two years management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise however if the company experiences cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in a threeyear period including the current and prior two years management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized these factors include historical operating results known or planned operating developments the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities tax law carryback capability in a particular country prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as the companys goodwill and other impairment testing after evaluation of these factors if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required to the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction management would establish a valuation allowance for additional information about income taxes see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements  75table of contentspension and other postretirement benefits plansthe measurement of liabilities related to pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans is based on several assumptions including interest rates expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates actual plan asset performance will either reduce or increase losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss which ultimately affects net income the discount rate for united states plans was determined by discounting the expected future benefit payments using a theoretical zerocoupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of highquality bonds as of the measurement date and solving for the single rate that generated the same benefit obligation only corporate bonds with a rating of aa or higher by either moodys investor services or standard amp poors were included callable bonds and certain other noncomparable bonds were eliminated finally a subset of bonds was selected by grouping the universe of bonds by duration and retaining 50 of the bonds that had the highest yields the discount rates for nonunited states plans were determined by region and are based on high quality longterm corporate and government bonds consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds to be used in determining the discount rate key assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement benefits expense are adjusted at each yearend a 1percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on pension plan assets is estimated to have approximately a 43 effect on pension expense likewise a 1percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a 74 effect on pension expense a 1percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on other postretirement benefits assets is estimated to have approximately a 1 effect on other postretirement benefits expense a 1percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a 4 effect on expense for other postretirement benefits plans additional information related to changes in key assumptions used to recognize expense for other postretirement benefits plans is found in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements environmental contingenciesas a result of past operations eaton is involved in remedial response and voluntary environmental remediation at a number of sites including certain of its currentlyowned or formerlyowned plants the company has also been named a potentially responsible party under the united states federal superfund law or the state equivalents thereof at a number of disposal sites a number of factors affect the cost of environmental remediation including the number of parties involved at a particular site the determination of the extent of contamination the length of time the remediation may require the complexity of environmental regulations and the continuing advancement of remediation technology taking these factors into account eaton has estimated the costs of remediation which will be paid over a period of years the company accrues an amount on an undiscounted basis consistent with the estimates of these costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred at december 31 2013 and 2012 149 and 158 respectively was accrued for these costs based upon eatons analysis and subject to the difficulty in estimating these future costs the company expects that any sum it may be required to pay in
