realize all of the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of cooper or those benefits may take longer to realize than expectedeatons ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the cooper transaction will depend to a large extent on the companys ability to integrate the two businesses the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively would preclude realization of the full benefits expected the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among othersthe diversion of managements attention to integration mattersdifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the business of cooper with that of eatondifficulties in the integration of operations and systemsdifficulties in the assimilation of employeesdifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex companychallenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers andchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnelmany of these factors will be outside of eatons control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of eaton volatility of end markets that eaton serves eatons segment revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that eaton serves the company has undertaken measures to reduce the impact of this volatility through diversification of markets it serves and expansion of geographic regions in which it operates future downturns in any of the markets could adversely affect revenues operating results and profitabilityeatons operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that eaton will continue to successfully introduce new products and servicesthe success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by eatons customers the companys businesses are affected to varying degrees by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles eaton may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production or marketing of new products and services which may prevent eaton from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market eatons ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to the companys results of operations and future growtheaton depends on the continued services and performance of key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly professionals with experience in its industry and business eaton cannot be certain that any of these individuals will continue his or her employment with the company a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart an inability to hire develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder the business by for example delaying eatons ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of the companys operationseatons operations depend on production facilities throughout the world which subjects them to varying degrees of risk of disrupted productioneaton manages businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide the companys manufacturing facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strike war political unrest terrorist activity economic upheaval or public health concerns some of these conditions are more likely in certain geographic regions in which eaton operates any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate for losses5table of contents if eaton is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches operations could be disrupted or data confidentiality losteaton relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including procurement manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages hardware failures

reputational damage eatons global operations subject it to economic risk as eatons results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government regulations and policies and currency fluctuationsoperating globally subjects eaton to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect eatons

businesses and significant shortages price increases or supplier insolvencies could increase operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of eatons productseatons major requirements for raw materials are described above in item 1 raw materials significant shortages could affect the prices eatons businesses are charged and the competitive position of their products and services all of which could adversely affect operating resultsfurther eatons suppliers of component parts may increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture component parts as a result the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs adversely affecting operating resultseaton may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights which could affect the companys ability to competeprotecting eatons intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to compete and succeed the company owns a large number of patents and patent applications worldwide as well as trademark and copyright registrations that are necessary and contribute significantly to the preservation of eatons competitive position in various markets although management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on the results of

circumvented by third parties eaton enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with the companys employees and into nondisclosure agreements with suppliers and appropriate

effective tax rate andor require the company to take further action at potentially significant expense to seek to preserve its effective tax rate eaton cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals however if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding the reincorporation to ireland or limiting eatons ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us the company could be subject to increased taxation andor potentially significant expense item 1b unresolved staff comments none
