sustainably eaton has approximately 97000 employees in over 60 countries and sells products to customers in more than 175 countriesthe consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes actual results could differ from these estimates management has evaluated subsequent events through the date the consolidated financial statements were filed with the securities exchange commissionthe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of eaton and all subsidiaries and other entities it controls intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated the equity method of accounting is used for investments in associate companies where the company has significant influence and generally a 20 to 50 ownership interest equity investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the book value of the investment exceeds fair value an impairment would exist if there is an otherthantemporary decline in value these associate companies are not material either individually or in the aggregate to eatons consolidated financial statements eaton does not have offbalance sheet arrangements or financings with unconsolidated entities in the ordinary course of business the company leases certain real properties and equipment as described in note 8eatons functional currency is united states dollars usd the functional currency for most subsidiaries is their local currency financial statements for these subsidiaries are translated at yearend exchange rates as to assets and liabilities and weightedaverage exchange rates as to revenues and expenses the resulting translation adjustments are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss during the fourth quarter of 2015 the company early adopted accounting standards update 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes asu 201517 asu 201517 requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities along with any related valuation allowance be classified as noncurrent on the companys consolidated balance sheet starting in 2017 the company elected to apply this standard prospectively for 2015 financial statements as a result prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentationrevenue recognitionsales of products are recognized when a sales agreement is in place products have been shipped to unaffiliated customers and title has transferred in accordance with shipping terms the selling price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured all significant related acts of performance have been completed and no other significant uncertainties exist shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related costs in cost of products sold although the majority of the sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for recognition purposes and if so how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element for delivered elements sales generally are recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are providedeaton records reductions to revenue for customer and distributor incentives primarily comprised of rebates at the time of the initial sale rebates are estimated based on sales terms historical experience trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served the rebate programs offered vary across businesses due to the numerous markets eaton serves but the most common incentives relate to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels 21table of contentsgoodwill and indefinite life intangible assetsgoodwill is evaluated annually for impairment as of july 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is equivalent to eatons operating segments and based on the net assets for each segment including goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is assigned to each operating segment as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and is the level at which management regularly reviews the operating results the company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis the discounted cash flow model considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital the forecasted cash flows are based on the companys longterm operating plan and a terminal value is used to estimate the operating segments cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise these analyses require the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows of the respective reporting unit sensitivity analyses are performed in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values additionally goodwill is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an operating segment is less than its carrying amountgoodwill impairment testing for 2015 and 2014 was performed using a qualitative analysis which is performed by assessing certain trends and factors including projected market outlook and growth rates forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins discount rates industry data and other relevant qualitative factors these trends and factors are compared to and based on the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative assessment performed in 2013 the results of these qualitative analyses did not indicate a need to perform a quantitative analysisbased on qualitative analyses performed in 2015 and 2014 and a quantitative analysis performed in 2013 the fair values of eatons reporting units continue to substantially exceed the respective carrying amountsindefinite life intangible assets consist of trademarks they are evaluated annually for impairment as of july 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis to determine whether their fair values exceed their respective carrying amounts indefinite life intangible asset impairment testing for 2015 and 2014 was performed using a quantitative analysis the company determines the fair value of these assets using a royalty relief methodology similar to that employed when the associated assets were acquired but using updated estimates of future sales cash flows and profitability additionally indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired for 2015 and 2014 the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets substantially exceeded the respective carrying valuefor additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets see note 5other longlived assetsdepreciation and amortization for property plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are generally computed by the straightline method and included in cost of products sold selling and administrative expense and research and development expense as appropriate cost of buildings are depreciated generally over 40 years and machinery and equipment over 3 to 10 years at december 31 2015 the weightedaverage amortization period for intangible assets subject to amortization was 17 years for patents and technology primarily as a result of the long life of aircraft platforms 17 years for customer relationships and 16 years for trademarks software is generally amortized up to a life of 10 yearsother longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable upon indications of impairment assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group would be considered impaired when the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group are less than its carrying value determining asset groups and underlying cash flows requires the use of significant judgmentretirement benefits plansfor the principal pension plans in the united states canada puerto rico and the united kingdom the company uses a marketrelated value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on assets used to determine net periodic benefit costs the marketrelated value of plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five year period all other plans use fair value of plan assetsnet actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a planbyplan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor the companys corridors are set at either 8 or 10 depending on the plan of the greater of the plan assets or benefit obligations gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over an average employee future service period that differs by plan but is approximately 11 years on a weighted average basis if most or all of the plans participants are no longer actively accruing benefits the average life expectancy is used 22table of contentswarranty accrualsproduct warranty

estimable see note 8 for additional information about warranty accrualsasset retirement obligationsa conditional asset retirement obligation is recognized at fair value when incurred if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated uncertainty about the timing or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation would be considered in the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists eaton believes that for substantially all of its asset retirement obligations there is an indeterminate settlement date because the range of time over which the company may settle the obligation is unknown or cannot be estimated a liability for these obligations will be recognized when sufficient information is available to estimate fair valueincome

to use 2014 tables and a generational improvement scale that are based on mp2015beginning in 2016 the company will adopt a change in the method it will use to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans historically for the vast majority of its plans the service and interest cost components were estimated using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in 2016 the company will use a spot rate approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows in the estimation of the service and interest components of benefit cost resulting in a more precise measurement this change does not affect the measurement of total benefit obligations the change will be accounted for as a change in estimate and accordingly will be accounted for prospectively starting in 2016 the discount rates that will be used to measure service and interest cost during 2016 are 43 and 33 respectively the discount rate that was measured at december 31 2015 and would have been used for service and interest cost under the prior estimation method was 40 the reductions in service cost and interest cost for 2016 associated with this change in estimate are

remediation systems and operation and maintenance of a remediation system the extent of expected remediation activities and costs varies by site a number of factors affect the cost of environmental remediation including the number of parties involved at a particular site the determination of the extent of contamination the length of time the remediation may require the complexity of environmental regulations and the continuing advancement of remediation technology taking these factors into account eaton has estimated the costs of remediation which will be paid over a period of years the company accrues an amount on an undiscounted basis consistent with the estimates of these costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred actual results may differ from these estimates at december 31 2015 and 2014 the company had an accrual totaling 131 and 140 respectively for these costsbased upon eatons analysis and subject to the difficulty in estimating these future costs the company expects that any sum it may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters is not reasonably possible to exceed the recorded liability by an amount that would have a

tax assetseaton is subject to the income tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine its income tax provision for financial statement purposes eaton must make significant estimates and judgments about its business operations in these jurisdictions these estimates and judgments are also used in determining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities that have been recognized for differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwardsmanagement evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates if the company experiences cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise however if the company experiences cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized these factors include historical operating results known or planned operating developments the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities tax law carryback capability in the particular country prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as those used for the companys goodwill and other impairment testing after evaluation of these factors if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required to the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction management would establish a valuation allowanceapplying the above methodology valuation allowances have been established for certain deferred income tax assets to the extent they are not expected to be realized within the particular tax carryforward periodunrecognized income tax benefitsa summary of gross unrecognized income tax

table of unrecognized income tax benefits above eaton recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in the provision for income tax expense the company has accrued penalties in jurisdictions primarily where they are automatically applied to any deficiency regardless of the merit of the positionthe resolution of the majority of eatons unrecognized income tax benefits is dependent upon uncontrollable factors such as the prospect of retroactive regulations new case law the willingness of the income tax authority to settle the issue including the timing thereof and other factors therefore for the majority of unrecognized income tax benefits it is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in the next 12 months for each of the unrecognized income tax benefits where it is possible to estimate the increase or decrease in the balance within the next 12 months the company does not anticipate any significant changeeaton or its

and may require the opening of the entire tax year in addition with only a few exceptions bz holdings inc and includible subsidiaries are no longer subject to united states state and local income tax examinations for years before 2011 with only a few exceptions the other foreign subsidiaries of both eaton and cooper are no longer subject to examinations for years before 2007at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011 the irs issued a notice for eaton corporation and includible subsidiaries 2005 and 2006 tax years the 2011 notice the 2011 notice proposed assessments of 75 in additional taxes plus 52 in penalties related primarily to transfer pricing adjustments for products manufactured in the companys facilities in puerto rico and the dominican republic and sold to affiliated companies located in the us net of agreed credits and deductions the company has set its transfer prices for products sold between these affiliates at the same prices that the company sells such products to third parties as required by two successive advance pricing agreements apas the company entered into with the irs for the years 2001 through 2004 the irs had previously accepted the transfer pricing methodology related to these apas after a comprehensive review conducted in two separate audit cycles on december 16 2011 immediately prior to the 2011 notice being issued the irs sent a letter stating that it was retrospectively canceling the apas even though their respective apa terms had already expired the company is contesting the proposed assessments the company believes that it was in full compliance with the terms of the two apas and that the irss cancellation of these two apas is without merit on february 29 2012 the company filed a petition with the us tax court in which it asserted that the transfer pricing established in the apas meets the armslength standard set by the us income tax laws and accordingly that the apas should be enforced in accordance with their terms the case involves both whether the apas should be enforced and if not the appropriate transfer pricing methodology the company believes that another important us tax court decision in 2015 further supports the companys armslength transfer pricing methodology the case was tried before the us tax court in august and september 2015 the case will be fully submitted to the court after the parties complete posttrial briefing in april 2016  42table of contentsduring the third quarter of 2014 the company received a notice from the irs for the 2007 through 2010 tax years the 2014 notice proposing assessments of 190 in additional taxes plus 72 in penalties net of agreed credits and deductions the proposed assessments pertain primarily to the same transfer pricing issues that are currently in litigation for the 2011 notice as noted above during 2007 through 2010 the company set its transfer prices for products sold between these affiliates consistent with the terms of a written apa between it and the irs that covered the years at issue to establish the relevant transfer prices the apa relied on prices at which the company sells the products to third parties the company has continued to apply the armslength transfer pricing methodology for 2011 through the current reporting period the 2014 notice includes a separate proposed assessment involving the recognition of income for several of the companys controlled foreign corporations the company believes that these proposed assessments are without merit on november 25 2014 the company filed a petition with the us tax court in which it challenged the irss adjustments the company expects the outcome of the 2014 notice on the transfer pricing matter to be determined by the judicial decision related to the 2011 notice also during the third quarter of 2014 the company resolved an uncertain tax position with a european government the resolution had minimal impact on the companys consolidated statements of incomeduring 2010 the company received a tax assessment of 64 plus interest and penalties in brazil for the tax years 2005 through 2008 that relates to the amortization of certain goodwill generated from the acquisition of thirdparty businesses and corporate reorganizations the company is contesting the assessment which is under review at the second of three administrative appeals levels during 2013 the brazilian tax authorities began an audit of tax years 2009 through 2012 during the third quarter of 2014 the company received a tax assessment of 50 plus interest and penalties for the 2009 through 2012 tax years primarily relating to the same issues concerning the 2005 through 2008 tax years which the company is also contesting and is under review in the second of three administrative appeals levels multiple outside advisors have stated that brazilian tax authorities are raising the issue for most clients with similar facts and that the matter is expected to require at least 10 years to resolve the company continues to believe that final resolution of the assessments will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements for the first time during 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in conjunction with the g20 finalized broadbased international tax policy guidelines that involve transfer pricing and other international tax subjects while some member jurisdictions automatically adopt the new oecd guidelines most member countries can adopt the guidelines only by new law or regulations the company is currently adopting processes to

participants would use in pricing an asset or liability as a basis for considering such assumptions a fair value hierarchy is established which categorizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and level 3

hedging activitiesin the normal course of business eaton is exposed to certain risks related to fluctuations in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices the company uses various derivative and nonderivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps currency forward exchange contracts currency swaps and to a lesser extent commodity contracts to manage risks from these market fluctuations the instruments used by eaton are straightforward nonleveraged instruments the counterparties to these instruments are financial institutions with strong credit ratings eaton maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one counterparty and regularly monitors the credit rating of these institutions such instruments are not purchased and sold for trading purposesderivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and recognized as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets accounting for the gain or loss resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated and is effective as part of a hedging relationship and if so as to the nature of the hedging activity eaton formally documents all relationships between derivative financial instruments accounted for as designated hedges and the hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction this process includes linking derivative financial instruments to a recognized asset or liability specific firm commitment forecasted transaction or net investment in a foreign operation these financial instruments can be designated ashedges of the change in the fair value of a recognized fixedrate asset or liability or the firm commitment to acquire such an asset or liability a fair value hedge for these hedges the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in income during the period of change in fair valuehedges of the variable cash flows of a recognized variablerate asset or liability or the forecasted acquisition of such an asset or liability a cash flow hedge for these hedges the effective portion of the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss and

investment hedge for these hedges the effective portion of the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to income in the same period when the gain or loss related to the net investment in the foreign operation is included in income the gain or loss from a derivative financial instrument designated as a hedge that is effective is classified in the same line of the consolidated statements of income as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item the change in fair value of a derivative financial instrument that is not effective as a hedge is immediately recognized in incomefor derivatives that are not designated as a hedge any gain or loss is immediately recognized in income the majority of derivatives used in this manner relate to risks resulting from assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and certain commodity contracts that arise in the normal course of business gains and losses associated with commodity hedge contracts are classified in cost of products sold 49table of contentseaton uses certain of its debt denominated in foreign currency to hedge portions of its net

united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may involve the exercise of significant judgment for any estimate or assumption used there may be other reasonable estimates or assumptions that could have been used however based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions management believes it is unlikely that applying other such estimates and assumptions would have caused materially different amounts to have been reported actual results may differ from these estimates revenue recognition sales of products are recognized when a sales agreement is in place products have been shipped to unaffiliated customers and title has transferred in accordance with shipping terms the selling price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured all significant related acts of performance have been completed and no other significant uncertainties exist shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related costs in cost of products sold although the majority of the sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for recognition purposes and if so how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element for delivered elements sales generally are recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are providedeaton records reductions to revenue for customer and distributor incentives primarily comprised of rebates at the time of the initial sale rebates are estimated based on sales

for impairment as of july 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is equivalent to eatons operating segments and based on the net assets for each segment including goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is assigned to each operating segment as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and is the level at which management regularly reviews the operating results the company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis additionally goodwill is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an operating segment is less than its carrying amount events or circumstances that may result in an impairment review include changes in macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance other relevant entityspecific events specific events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease in share pricegoodwill impairment testing for 2015 and 2014 was performed using a qualitative analysis which is performed by assessing certain trends and factors that require significant judgment including projected market outlook and growth rates forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins discount rates industry data and other relevant qualitative factors these trends and factors are compared to and based on the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative assessment the results of these qualitative analyses did not indicate a need to perform a quantitative analysisgoodwill impairment testing for 2013 was performed using a quantitative analysis under which the fair value for each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model which considered forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital the forecasted cash flows were based on the companys longterm operating plan and a terminal value was used to estimate the operating segments cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise these analyses require the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows of the respective reporting unit sensitivity analyses were performed in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values based on quantitative analyses performed in 2015 and 2014 and quantitative analysis performed in 2013 the fair values of eatons reporting units continue to substantially exceed the respective carrying amounts 72table of contentsindefinite

asset upon indications of impairment assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group would be considered impaired when the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group are less than its carrying value in instances where the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded the undiscounted cash flows the fair value of the asset group would be determined and an impairment loss would be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value

assets see note 5 to the consolidated financial statementsrecoverability of deferred income tax assetseaton is subject to the income tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine the income tax provision for financial statement purposes eaton must make significant estimates and judgments about its business operations in these jurisdictions these estimates and judgments are also used in determining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities that have been recognized for differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each jurisdiction in which it operates if the company experiences cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in a threeyear period including the current and prior two years management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise however if the company experiences cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in a threeyear period including the current and prior two years management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized these factors include historical operating results known or planned operating developments the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities tax law carryback capability in a particular country prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as the companys goodwill and other impairment testing after evaluation of these factors if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required to the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction management would establish a valuation allowance for additional information about income taxes see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements pension and other postretirement benefits plansthe measurement of liabilities related to pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans is based on assumptions related to future events including interest rates return on plan assets rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates actual plan asset performance will either reduce or increase losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss which ultimately affects net income  73table of contentsthe discount rate for united states plans was determined by discounting the expected future benefit payments using a theoretical zerocoupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of highquality bonds as of the measurement date and solving for the single rate that generated the same benefit obligation only corporate bonds with a rating of aa or higher by either moodys or standard amp poors were included callable bonds and certain other noncomparable bonds were eliminated finally a subset of bonds was selected by grouping the universe of bonds by duration and retaining 50 of the bonds that had the highest yields the discount rates for nonunited states plans were determined by region and are based on high quality longterm corporate and government bonds consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds to be used in determining the discount rate key assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement benefits expense are adjusted at each yearend a 1percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on pension plan assets is estimated to have approximately a 45 effect on pension expense likewise a 1percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a 78 effect on pension expense a 1percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on other postretirement benefits assets is estimated to have approximately a 1 effect on other postretirement benefits expense a 1percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a 3 effect on expense for other postretirement benefits plans beginning in 2016 the company will adopt a change in the method it will use to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans historically for the vast majority of its plans the service and interest cost components were estimated using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in 2016 the company will use a spot rate approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows in the estimation of the service and interest components of benefit cost resulting in a more precise measurement this change does not affect the measurement of total benefit obligations the change will be accounted for as a change in estimate and accordingly will be accounted for prospectively starting in 2016 the reductions in service cost and interest cost for 2016 associated with this change in estimate are expected to be 3 and 42 respectivelyadditional information related to changes in key assumptions used to recognize expense for other postretirement benefits plans is found in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements environmental contingenciesas a result of past operations eaton is involved in remedial response and voluntary environmental remediation at a number of sites including certain of its currentlyowned or formerlyowned plants the company has also been named a potentially responsible party under the united states federal superfund law or the state equivalents thereof at a number of disposal sites a number of factors affect the cost of environmental remediation including the number of parties involved at a particular site the determination of the extent of contamination the length of time the remediation may require the complexity of environmental regulations and the continuing advancement of remediation technology taking these factors into account eaton has estimated the costs of remediation which will be paid over a period of years the company accrues an amount on an undiscounted basis consistent with the estimates of these costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred at december 31 2015 and 2014 131 and 140 respectively was accrued for these costs based upon eatons analysis and subject to the difficulty in estimating these future costs the company expects that any sum it may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters is not reasonably possible to exceed the recorded liability by an amount that would have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flowsmarket risk disclosure on a regular basis eaton monitors thirdparty depository institutions that hold its cash and shortterm investments primarily for safety of principal and secondarily for maximizing yield on those funds the company
