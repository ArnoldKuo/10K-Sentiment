affect revenues operating results and profitabilityeatons operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that eaton will continue to successfully introduce new products and servicesthe success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by eatons customers the companys businesses are affected to varying degrees by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles eaton may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production or marketing of new products and services which may prevent eaton from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market  3table of contentseatons ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees

estimates management has evaluated subsequent events through the date the consolidated financial statements were filed with the securities exchange commissionthe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of eaton and all subsidiaries and other entities it controls intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated the equity method of accounting is used for investments in associate companies where the company has significant influence and generally a 20 to 50 ownership interest equity investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the book value of the investment exceeds fair value an impairment would exist if there is an otherthantemporary decline in value these associate companies are not material either individually or in the aggregate to eatons consolidated financial statements eaton does not have offbalance sheet arrangements or financings with unconsolidated entities in the ordinary course of business the company leases certain real properties and equipment as described in note 8eatons functional currency is united states dollars usd the functional currency for most subsidiaries is their local currency financial statements for these subsidiaries are translated at yearend exchange rates as to assets and liabilities and weightedaverage exchange rates as to revenues and expenses the resulting

simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs asu 201503 asu 201503 requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than an asset the company has applied this standard retrospectively the adoption of asu 201503 resulted in the reclassification of 35 within the companys consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 respectively from other noncurrent assets to a reduction in longterm debtduring 2016 the company adopted accounting standards update 201507 fair value measurement

if their share price is not published for current transactions referred to as the practical expedient prior to asu 201507 there has been diversity in practice related to how investments measured using the practical expedient are categorized within the fair value hierarchy with the adoption of asu 201507 these investments are no longer categorized in the fair value hierarchy which eliminates the diversity in practice resulting from the way in which these investments were classified in addition asu 201507 removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for these investments the company retrospectively applied the requirements of asu 201507 for all comparative periods presented in note 7 resulting in investments measured using the net asset value practical expedient no longer being categorized in the fair value hierarchycertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 21table of contentsrevenue recognitionsales of products are recognized when a sales agreement is in place products have been shipped to unaffiliated customers and title has transferred in accordance with shipping terms the selling price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured all significant related acts of performance have been completed and no other significant uncertainties exist shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related costs in cost of products sold although the majority of the sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for recognition purposes and if so how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element for delivered elements sales generally are recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are providedeaton records reductions to revenue for customer and distributor incentives primarily comprised of rebates at the time of the initial sale rebates are estimated based on sales terms historical experience trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served the rebate programs offered vary across businesses due to the numerous markets eaton serves but the most common incentives relate to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levelsgoodwill and indefinite life intangible assetsgoodwill is evaluated annually for impairment as of july 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is equivalent to eatons operating segments and based on the net assets for each segment including goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is assigned to each operating segment as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and is the level at which management regularly reviews the operating results the company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis additionally goodwill is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an operating segment is less than its carrying amountgoodwill impairment testing for 2016 was performed using a quantitative analysis under which the fair value for each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model which considered forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital the forecasted cash flows were based on the companys longterm operating plan and a terminal value was used to estimate the operating segments cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise these analyses require the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows of the respective reporting unit sensitivity analyses were performed around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values goodwill impairment testing in 2015 was performed using qualitative analysis which is performed by assessing certain trends and factors including projected market outlook and growth rates forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins discount rates industry data and other relevant qualitative factors these trends and factors are compared to and based on the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative assessment performed in 2013 the results of the qualitative analysis did not indicate a need to perform a quantitative analysis based on a quantitative analysis performed in 2016 and a qualitative analysis performed in 2015 the fair value of eatons reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts indefinite life intangible assets consist of certain trademarks they are evaluated annually for impairment as of july 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis to determine whether their fair values exceed their respective carrying amounts indefinite life intangible asset impairment testing for 2016 and 2015 was performed using a quantitative analysis the company determines the fair value of these assets using a royalty relief methodology similar to that employed when the associated assets were acquired but using updated estimates of future sales cash flows and profitability additionally indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired for 2016 and 2015 the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded the respective carrying valuefor additional

to amortization are generally computed by the straightline method and included in cost of products sold selling and administrative expense and research and development expense as appropriate cost of buildings are depreciated generally over 40 years and machinery and equipment over 3 to 10 years at december 31 2016 the weightedaverage amortization period for intangible assets subject to amortization was 17 years for patents and technology primarily as a result of the long life of aircraft platforms 17 years for customer relationships and 16 years for certain trademarks software is generally amortized up to a life of 10 yearsother longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable upon indications of impairment assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset

products sold as well as accruals for product recalls and other events when they are known and estimable see note 8 for additional information about warranty accrualsasset retirement obligationsa conditional asset retirement obligation is recognized at fair value when incurred if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated uncertainty about the timing or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation would be considered in the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists eaton believes that for substantially all of its asset retirement obligations there is an indeterminate settlement date because the range of time over which the company may settle the obligation is unknown or cannot be estimated a liability for these obligations will be recognized when sufficient information is available to estimate fair valueincome taxesdeferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of the respective assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year when the differences are expected to reverse deferred income tax assets are recognized

2014 tables and a generational improvement scale that are based on mp2016in 2016 the company adopted a change in the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans prior to 2016 for the vast majority of its plans the service and interest cost components were estimated using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in 2016 the company used a spot rate approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows in the estimation of the service and interest components of benefit cost resulting in a more precise measurement this change does not affect the measurement of total benefit obligations the change was accounted for as a change in estimate and accordingly was accounted for prospectively starting in

company experiences cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise however if the company experiences cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized these factors include historical operating results known or planned operating developments the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities tax law carryback capability in the particular country prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as those used for the companys goodwill and other impairment testing after evaluation of these factors if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required to the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction management would establish a valuation

benefits in the provision for income tax expense the company has accrued penalties in jurisdictions primarily where they are automatically applied to any deficiency regardless of the merit of the positionthe resolution of the majority of eatons unrecognized income tax benefits is dependent upon uncontrollable factors such as the prospect of retroactive regulations new case law the willingness

the 2005 and 2006 tax years the 2011 notice the 2011 notice proposed assessments of 75 in additional taxes plus 52 in penalties related primarily to transfer pricing adjustments for products manufactured in the companys facilities in puerto rico and the dominican republic and sold to affiliated companies located in the us net of agreed credits and deductions the company has set its transfer prices for products sold between these affiliates at the same prices that the company sells such products to third parties as required by two successive advance pricing agreements apas the company entered into with the irs for the years 2001 through 2004 the irs had previously accepted the transfer pricing methodology related to these apas after a comprehensive review conducted in two separate audit cycles immediately prior to the 2011 notice being issued the irs sent a letter stating that it was retrospectively canceling the apas even though their respective apa terms had already expiredthe company is contesting the proposed assessments the company believes that it was in full compliance with the terms of the two apas and that the irss cancellation of these two apas is without merit on february 29 2012 the company filed a petition with the us tax court in which it asserted that the transfer pricing established in the apas meets the armslength standard set by the us income tax laws and accordingly that the apas should be enforced in accordance with their terms the case involves both whether the apas should be enforced and if not the appropriate transfer pricing methodology the tax courts decision in the case is now pending following a trial in 2015 and the completion of the parties briefing in 2016 in 2014 the company received a notice from the irs for the 2007 through 2010 tax years the 2014 notice proposing assessments of 190 in additional taxes plus 72 in penalties net of agreed credits and deductions the proposed assessments pertain primarily to the same transfer pricing issues for which the tax courts decision is pending as noted above during 2007 through 2010 the company set its transfer prices for products sold between its affiliates consistent with the terms of a written apa between it and the irs that covered the years at issue to establish the relevant transfer prices the apa relied on prices at which the company sells the products to third parties the company has continued to apply the armslength transfer pricing methodology for 2011 through the current reporting period the 2014 notice includes a separate proposed assessment involving the recognition of income for several of the companys controlled foreign corporations the company believes that all proposed assessments are without merit on november 25 2014 the company filed a petition with the us tax court in which it challenged the irss adjustments the company expects the outcome of the 2014 notice on the transfer pricing matter to be determined by the judicial decision related to the 2011 notice in 2016 litigation activities commenced for the separate issue in the 2014 notice regarding recognition of income for several of the companys controlled

based on an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to satisfy a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability as a basis for considering such assumptions a fair value hierarchy is established which categorizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and level 3 unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptionsa

rates and commodity prices the company uses various derivative and nonderivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps currency forward exchange contracts currency swaps and to a lesser extent commodity contracts to manage risks from these market fluctuations the instruments used by eaton are straightforward nonleveraged instruments the counterparties to these instruments are financial institutions with strong credit ratings eaton maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one counterparty and regularly monitors the credit rating of these institutions such instruments are not purchased and sold for trading purposesderivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and recognized as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets accounting for the gain or loss resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated and is effective as part of a hedging relationship and if so as to the nature of the hedging activity eaton formally documents all relationships between derivative financial instruments accounted for as designated hedges and the hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction this process includes linking derivative financial instruments to a

significant judgment for any estimate or assumption used there may be other reasonable estimates or assumptions that could have been used however based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions management believes it is unlikely that applying other such estimates and assumptions would have caused materially different amounts to have been reported actual

transferred in accordance with shipping terms the selling price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured all significant related acts of performance have been completed and no other significant uncertainties exist shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related costs in cost of products sold although the majority of the sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for recognition purposes and if so how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element for delivered elements sales generally are recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value and there are no

circumstances that may result in an impairment review include changes in macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance other relevant entityspecific events specific events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease in share pricegoodwill impairment testing for 2016 was performed using a quantitative analysis under which the fair value for each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model which considered forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital the forecasted cash flows were based on the companys longterm operating plan and a terminal value was used to estimate the operating segments cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise these analyses require the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows of the respective reporting unit sensitivity analyses were performed in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values goodwill impairment testing for 2015 and 2014 was performed using a qualitative analysis which is performed by assessing certain trends and factors that require significant judgment including projected market outlook and growth rates forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins discount rates industry data and other relevant qualitative factors these trends and factors are compared to and based on the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative assessment the

assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group would be considered impaired when the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group are less than its carrying value in instances where the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded the

carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwardsmanagement evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each jurisdiction in which it operates if the company experiences cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in a threeyear period including the current and prior two years management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise however if the company experiences cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in a threeyear period including the current and prior two years management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized these factors include historical operating results known or planned operating developments the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse

earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as the companys goodwill and other impairment testing after evaluation of these factors if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be

plans is based on assumptions related to future events including interest rates return on plan assets rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates actual plan asset performance will either reduce or increase losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss which ultimately affects net income the discount rate for united states plans was determined by discounting the expected future benefit payments using a theoretical zerocoupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of highquality bonds as of the measurement date and solving for the single rate that generated the same benefit obligation only corporate bonds with a rating of aa or higher by either moodys or standard amp poors were included callable bonds and certain other noncomparable bonds were eliminated finally a subset of bonds was selected by grouping the universe of bonds by duration and retaining 50 of the bonds that had the highest yields the discount rates for nonunited states plans were determined by region and are based on high quality longterm corporate and government bonds consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds to be used in determining the discount rate 78table of contentsin 2016 the company adopted a change in the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans prior to 2016 for the vast majority of its plans the service and interest cost components were estimated using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in 2016 the company used a spot rate approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows in the estimation of the service and interest components of benefit cost resulting in a more precise measurement this change does not affect the measurement of total benefit obligations the change was accounted for as a change in estimate and accordingly was accounted for prospectively starting in 2016 the reductions in service cost and interest cost for 2016 associated with this change in estimate were 3 and 42 respectively key assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement benefits expense are adjusted at each yearend a 1percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on pension plan assets is estimated to have approximately a 43 effect on pension expense likewise a 1percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a 70 effect on pension expense a 1percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on other postretirement benefits assets is estimated to have approximately a 1 effect on other postretirement benefits expense a 1percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a 3 effect on expense for other postretirement benefits plans additional information related to changes in key assumptions used to recognize expense for other postretirement benefits plans is found in note 7 to the consolidated
