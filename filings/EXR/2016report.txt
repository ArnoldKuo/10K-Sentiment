public nontraded reit smartstop stockholders received 1375 per share in cash which represents a total purchase price of approximately 14 billion we paid approximately 13 billion and the remaining consideration came from the sale of certain assets by smartstop immediately prior to the closing as a result of the acquisition we acquired 122 stores and assumed the management of 43 stores previously managed by smartstop  management  members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the selfstorage industry having acquired andor developed a significant number of stores since before our ipo our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows spencer f kirk chief executive officer 18 years scott stubbs

10 years james overturf executive vice president and chief marketing officer 17 years joseph d margolis executive vice president and chief investment officer 10 years and kenneth m woolley executive chairman 35 years  our executive management team and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 4923970 shares or 39 of our outstanding common stock as of february 18 2016  industry amp competition  stores offer monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use and are a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet stores generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed  selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a stores local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that residential tenants place in selfstorage range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods  our research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for stores a stores perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a    5    table of contents  sites ability to successfully secure rentals although most stores are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time  the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march  since inception in the early 1970s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth the selfstorage industry has also seen increases in occupancy over the past several years according to the selfstorage almanac the almanac in 2008 the national average physical occupancy rate was 803 of net rentable square feet compared to an average physical occupancy rate of 902 in 2015  we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire stores especially for brokered portfolios aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this competition will likely continue  the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states owned approximately 174 of the total us stores and the top 50 selfstorage companies owned approximately 219 of the total us stores as of december 31 2015 we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future we also believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions given our historical reputation for closing deals  we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are one of five public selfstorage reits along with cubesmart national storage affiliates sovran selfstorage inc and public storage inc  longterm growth and investment strategies  our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per

buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals we continue to bid on available acquisitions and are seeing increasing prices however we remain a disciplined buyer and look for acquisitions that will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value           expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint we believe this expanded footprint enables

enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores    6    table of contents financing of our longterm growth strategies  acquisition and development financing  the

annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed  our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our stores there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our stores generate including the following  risks related to our stores and operations  adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results  our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in

including the need for capital improvements insurance premiums real estate taxes and utilities           the impact of environmental protection laws           changes in tax real estate and zoning laws and           earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters terrorist acts civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses  if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected our business and results of operations would be adversely affected  virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth  we depend upon our onsite personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our stores and any difficulties we encounter in hiring training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance  we had 2716 field personnel as of february 18 2016 in the management and operation of our stores the general professionalism of our store managers and staff are contributing factors to a stores ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure stores if

conditions existing on stores or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations  environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our stores may affect our results of operations  under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such substances or materials the presence of such substances or materials or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners or operators ability to lease sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real stores for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials  certain environmental laws also impose liability without regard to knowledge or fault for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property moreover the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases  certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances for example environmental laws govern the management of asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions  no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our stores reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of our stores did not create any material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our stores there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future finally future laws ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability  costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses  under the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our stores or restrict certain further renovations of the stores with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our stores to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if one or more of our stores is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance if    10    table of contents  we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected  our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation which may adversely affect our results  our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals to promulgate interpret and implement regulations and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers as a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment which could adversely affect our business and results of operations  we face competition for the acquisition of stores and other assets which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions  we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of stores and other assets including national regional and local operators and developers of stores these competitors may drive up the price we pay for stores or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those stores or assets themselves in addition our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment in stores may increase this competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them because of an increased interest in singlestore acquisitions among taxmotivated individual purchasers we may pay higher prices if we purchase single stores in comparison with portfolio acquisitions if we pay higher prices for stores or other assets our profitability will be reduced  we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth  our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable stores or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price  our ability to acquire stores on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks           competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital including other publiclytraded reits and institutional investment funds           competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability           the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions           failure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all           we may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired stores and    11    table of contents        we may acquire stores subject to liabilities without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the stores and claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the stores  in addition strategic decisions by us such as acquisitions may adversely affect the price of our securities  we may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired stores  we have acquired many stores in the past and we expect to continue acquiring stores in the future if we acquire any stores we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio the acquired stores may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert managements attention away from daytoday operations which could impair our operating results as a whole  we do not always obtain independent appraisals of our stores and thus the consideration paid for these stores may exceed the value that may be indicated by thirdparty appraisals  we do not always obtain thirdparty appraisals in connection with our acquisition of stores and the consideration being paid by us in exchange for those stores may exceed the value determined by thirdparty appraisals in such cases the value of the stores was determined by our senior management team  our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions  to the extent that we engage in development and redevelopment activities we will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects           we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all           we may not complete development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts           we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning land use building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations and           occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped stores may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including market and economic conditions and may result in our investment not being profitable  in deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the store we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly developed store as quickly as expected or at all any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition which could result in a decline in the value of our securities  we may rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects if our reputation in the selfstorage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced our ability to develop or redevelop stores could be affected which would limit our growth  we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business  we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial    12    table of contents  transactions and records personally identifiable information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information while to date we have not experienced a security breach this risk has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of such breaches and attempted breaches from around the world have increased any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation divert significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations  risks related to our organization and structure  our business could be harmed if key personnel with longstanding business relationships in the selfstorage industry terminate their employment with us  our success depends on the continued services of members of our executive management team who have substantial experience in the selfstorage industry in addition our ability to acquire or develop stores in the future depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of prudential financial inc there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects  we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks  we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from and possibly riskier than the investments and businesses described in this document a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations  if other selfstorage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions  because we are structured as an upreit we are a more attractive acquirer of stores to taxmotivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits however if other selfstorage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits this competitive advantage will disappear in addition new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service irs or the us treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions  tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels  we have provided certain tax protections to various third parties in connection with their property contributions to the operating partnership upon acquisition by the company including making available the opportunity to 1 guarantee debt or 2 enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation we have agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our business    13    table of contents our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority  as of december 31 2015 we held interests in 253 operating stores through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new stores and acquiring existing stores in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the stores we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting stores owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition  conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership  conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest  additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful    14    table of contents the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement  certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction  our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing to spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter  our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders  our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders  our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited  maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors and officers liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers  to the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock  distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a us stockholder under current us federal income tax law to the extent those    15    table of contents  distributions do not exceed the stockholders adjusted tax basis in his her or its common stock but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis if distributions result in a reduction of a stockholders adjusted basis in such holders common stock subsequent sales of such holders common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis  risks related to the real estate industry  our primary business involves the ownership and operation of stores  our current strategy is to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop only stores consequently we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change decreases in market rents negative tax real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs lower the value of our investments and decrease our income which would adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results  illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our stores  because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more stores in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions is limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any store for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a store  we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a store can be sold we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements in acquiring a store we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that store for a period of time or impose other restrictions such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that store these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a store even if we deem it necessary or appropriate  any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield incomeproducing returns if at all and may result in additional costs to us to comply with rezoning restrictions or environmental regulations  we have invested in the past and may invest in the future in unimproved real property unimproved properties generally take longer to yield incomeproducing returns based on the typical time required for development any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with rezoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an incomeproducing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results  any negative perceptions of the selfstorage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price  to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the selfstorage industry the value of our securities may be negatively impacted which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets    16    table of contents risks related to our debt financings  disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us  uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell stores or may adversely affect the price we receive for stores that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing  required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our stores or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations  as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 36 billion of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future stores additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions  if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following           our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments           we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms including to make acquisitions or to continue to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit           we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness           because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense           we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our stores possibly on disadvantageous terms           after debt service the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced           our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt           we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions           we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our stores that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases           we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgages may enforce our guarantees           we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations and           our default under any one of our mortgage loans with crossdefault or crosscollateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other stores    17    table of contents increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders  as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 36 billion of debt outstanding of which approximately 11 billion or 314 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 21 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions for example if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 73 million annually  failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations  in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders  risks related to qualification and operation as a reit  to maintain our qualification as a reit we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions  to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis or possibly longterm to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments  dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates  the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual us stockholders is 20 dividends paid by reits however are generally not eligible for the reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our securities  in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our stores  possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders  the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may    18    table of contents  have retroactive application could adversely affect our stockholders it cannot be predicted whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed  the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders  our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to qualify as a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders  our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock  we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because           we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates           we also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and           unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified  in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities  qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains and we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income including capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us    19    table of contents  federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding our qualification as a reit  we will pay some taxes  even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages stores for our joint ventures and stores owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs of our company for us federal income tax purposes a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us esm reinsurance limited a whollyowned subsidiary of extra space management inc generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we dont intend to sell stores as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our taxable reit subsidiary is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders  complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities  to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits      item 1b unresolved staff comments  none      item 2 properties  as of december 31 2015 we owned or had ownership interests in 999 operating stores of these stores 746 are whollyowned and 253 are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 348 stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which we own andor manage to 1347 these stores are located in 36 states washington dc and puerto rico we receive a management fee generally equal to approximately 60 of cash collected from total revenues to manage the joint venture and third party sites as of december 31 2015 we owned andor managed approximately 101 million square feet of rentable space configured in approximately 896000 separate storage units approximately 70 of our stores are clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics for stores the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence  we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years    20    table of contents as of december 31 2015 approximately 800000 tenants were leasing storage units at the 1347 operating stores that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time for stores that were stabilized as of december 31 2015 the average length of stay was approximately 137 months  the average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized stores net of discounts and bad debt was 1483 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 1402 for the year ended december 31 2014 average annual rent per square foot for new leases was 1541 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 1435 for the year ended december 31 2014 the average discounts as a percentage of rental revenues during these periods were 33 and 38 respectively  our store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located most often sites are what we consider hybrid facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only

the ordinary course of business because litigation is inherently unpredictable the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty in accordance with applicable accounting guidance management establishes an accrued liability for litigation when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable in such cases there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued the estimated loss if any is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties therefore any estimates of loss disclosed below represents what management believes to be an estimate of loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria and does not represent our maximum loss exposure we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period notwithstanding the fact that we are currently vigorously defending any legal proceedings against us  we currently have several legal proceedings pending against us that include causes of

thereto appearing elsewhere in this report we make statements in this section that are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws for a complete discussion of forwardlooking statements see the section in this form 10k entitled statements regarding forwardlooking information certain risk factors may cause actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion for a discussion of such risk factors see the section in this form 10k entitled risk factors amounts in thousands except share and per share data  overview  we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by extra space storage llc and its subsidiaries to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed stores  at december 31 2015 we owned had ownership interests in or managed 1347 operating stores in 36 states washington dc and puerto rico of these 1347 operating stores we owned 746 we held joint venture interests in 253 stores and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 348 stores that are owned by third parties these operating stores contain approximately 101 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 896000 units and currently serve a customer base of approximately 800000 tenants  our stores are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization a store is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years  to maximize the performance of our stores we employ industryleading revenue management systems developed by our management team these systems enable us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues  we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under leases at each of our whollyowned stores from management fees on the stores we manage for jointventure partners and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program our management fee is generally equal to approximately 60 of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed stores we also receive an asset management fee of 05 of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures  we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our store results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industryleading technology systems    29    table of contents we continue to evaluate a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following           maximize the performance of our stores through strategic efficient and proactive management we pursue revenuegenerating and expenseminimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost           acquire stores our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multistore portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals we continue to see available acquisitions on which to bid and are seeing increasing prices however we remain a disciplined buyer and look for acquisitions that will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value           expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint we believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores  critical accounting policies and estimates  our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies  consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities vies an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie  a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entitys equity holders as a group either a lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest or combination of variable interests that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie  we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the    30    table of contents  obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements as of december 31 2015 we had no consolidated vies additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated  real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized  expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between 5 and 39 years  in connection with our acquisition of stores the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings is determined as if vacant intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transaction costs are expensed as incurred  intangible lease rights include 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on three stores that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on six stores where the ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms  evaluation of asset impairment long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on stores where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these stores we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we review stores in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections  when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred we compare the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets  when real estate assets are identified as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets net of selling costs if the estimated fair value net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets we would recognize a loss on the disposal group classified as held for sale the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations for all periods presented    31    table of contents investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements  under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint ventures sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity  our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment using significant unobservable inputs is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment  derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges  for derivatives designated as fair value hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings  revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the leases promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period late charges administrative fees merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities interest income is recognized as earned  property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected  tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage we record an unpaid claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history the unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end including both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported we use a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received the administrator evaluates each claim to determine the ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported annually a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid    32    table of contents  claims liability prior year claim reserves are adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known the impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations the unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value each tenant chooses the amount of insurance coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program tenants can purchase policies in amounts of two thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars of insurance coverage in exchange for a monthly fee our exposure per claim is limited by the maximum amount of coverage chosen by each tenant we purchase reinsurance for losses exceeding a set amount on any one event we do not currently have any amounts recoverable under the reinsurance arrangements  income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex if we were to fail to meet these requirements we would be subject to federal income tax we are subject to certain state and local taxes provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations  we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred  recent accounting pronouncements  in april 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201408 presentation of financial statements topic 205 and property plant and equipment topic 360 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity under this guidance only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations the guidance also requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation the company adopted this guidance effective january 1 2015 we have not previously had discontinued operations and as such this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous industryspecific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the international financial reporting standards asu 201409 outlines a fivestep process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards the amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers asu 201409 was originally effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption in july 2015 the fasb approved a oneyear deferral of the effective date of the standard the new standard will now become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption on the original effective date permitted the company has not yet selected a transition method management is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of asu 201409 on our consolidated financial statements  in february 2015 the fasb issued asu 201502 consolidation topic 810 amendments to the consolidation analysis this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 including interim periods within that reporting period asu 201502 amends the criteria for determining if    33    table of contents  a service provider possesses a variable interest in a variable interest entity vie and eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership we do not expect the adoption of this standard to materially impact its consolidated financial statements  in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503 interestimputation of interest simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability the new guidance only impacts financial statement presentation the guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2016 and allows for early adoption we adopted this guidance october 1 2015 on a retrospective basis as a result 20120 of unamortized debt issuance costs that had been included in the other assets line on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2014 are now presented as direct deductions from the carrying amounts of the related debt liabilities  in

regarding the accounting for fees paid by a customer in cloud computing arrangements if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license the payment of fees should be accounted for in the same manner as the acquisition of other software licenses if there is no software license the fees should be accounted for as a service contract the guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 and early adoption is permitted an entity can elect to adopt the amendments either 1 prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective

                                   34    table of contents property rentalthe change in property rental revenues consists primarily of an increase of 69622 associated with acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2014 we acquired 171 operating stores during 2015 and 51 stores during 2014 in addition revenues increased by 47560 as a result of increases in occupancy and rental rates to new and existing customers at our stabilized stores we have seen no significant increase in overall customer renewal rates and our average length of stay is approximately 137 months for existing customers we generally seek to increase rental rates approximately 7 to 10 at least annually rental rates to new tenants increased by approximately 89 over the prior year occupancy at our stabilized stores increased to 911 at december 31 2015 as compared to 896 at december 31 2014  tenant reinsurancethe increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was partially due to the increase in overall customer participation to approximately 728 at december 31 2015 compared to approximately 707 at december 31 2014 in addition we operated 1347 stores at december 31 2015 compared to 1088 stores at december 31 2014  management fees and other incomeour taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc manages stores owned by our joint ventures and third parties management fees generally represent 60 of cash collected from stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures we also earn an asset management fee from the storage portfolio i spi joint venture equal to 050 multiplied by the total asset value provided certain conditions are met the increase in management fees is due to an increase in the number of properties managed at december 31 2015 we managed 348 stores compared to 260 stores at

 funds from operations  ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc nareit as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements  the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions  the following table presents the calculation of ffo for the periods indicated                        for the year endeddecember 31        2015     2014     2013

market risk  market risk  market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates  interest rate risk  interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control  as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 36 billion in total face value debt of which approximately 11 billion was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 73 million annually  interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible

accrual basis of accounting in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and include the accounts of the company and its wholly or majorityowned subsidiaries all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation  variable interest entities  the company accounts for arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights as variable interest entities vies an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entitys equity holders as a group either a lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest or combination of variable interests that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie    58    table of contents the company has concluded that under certain circumstances when the company enters into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created the company has performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with the companys financial statements additionally the operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated  the companys investments in real estate joint ventures where the company has significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which the company is not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements  use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates  fair value disclosures  derivative financial instruments  currently the company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts the variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate forward curves  the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements in adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk the company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings thresholds mutual puts and guarantees in conjunction with the financial accounting standard boards fair value measurement guidance the company made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio  although the company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize level 3 inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties however as of december 31 2015 the company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives as a result the company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy    59    table of contents the table below presents the companys assets and liabilities measured

remeasured on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs as of december 31 2015 or 2014  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  longlived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment the company reviews each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist the company focuses on stores where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these stores the company determines whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition the company reviews stores in the leaseup stage and compares actual operating results to original projections  when the company determines that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred the company compares the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets  when real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale the company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value of the assets net of selling costs if the estimated fair value net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets the company would recognize a loss on the disposal group classified as held for sale the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations for all periods presented as of december 31 2015 the company had seven stores classified as held for sale the estimated fair value less selling costs of each of these assets is greater than the carrying value of the assets and therefore no loss has been recorded  the company assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the companys investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired annually and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment  as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on

cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized the construction period begins when expenditures for the real estate assets have been made and activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use are in progress the construction period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use  expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between five and 39 years  in connection with the companys acquisition of stores the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings is determined as if vacant intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases the company measures the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on the companys historical experience with turnover in its stores debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transaction costs are expensed as incurred    61    table of contents intangible lease rights represent 1 purchase price

recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms  investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures  the companys investments in real estate joint ventures where the company has significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which the company is not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  under the equity method the companys investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for the companys share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on the companys ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows the company follows the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint ventures sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity  cash and cash equivalents  the companys cash is deposited with financial institutions located throughout the united states and at times may exceed federally insured limits the company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity date of three months or less to be cash

computed on a straightline basis over three to five years  derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative whether the company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk such as interest rate risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged    62    table of contents  forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge the company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain

financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio  risk management and use of financial instruments  in the normal course of its ongoing business operations the company encounters economic risk there are three main components of economic risk interest rate risk credit risk and market risk the company is subject to interest rate risk on its interestbearing liabilities credit risk is the risk of inability or unwillingness of tenants to make contractually required payments market risk is the risk of declines in the value of stores due to changes in rental rates interest rates or other market factors affecting the value of stores held by the company the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of

amounts estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected  tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage the company records an unpaid claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history the unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end including both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported the company uses a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received the administrator evaluates each claim to determine the ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported annually a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid claims liability prior year claim reserves are adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known the impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations the unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value each tenant chooses the amount of insurance coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program tenants can purchase policies in amounts of two thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars of insurance coverage

the company is involved in various legal proceedings and is subject to various claims and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business because litigation is inherently unpredictable the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty in accordance with applicable accounting guidance management establishes an accrued liability for litigation when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable in such cases there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued the estimated loss if any is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties therefore any estimates of loss disclosed below represents what management believes to be an estimate of loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria and does not represent our maximum loss exposure the company could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in any particular period notwithstanding the fact that the company is currently vigorously defending any legal proceedings against it  the company currently has several legal proceedings pending against it that include causes of action alleging wrongful foreclosure violations of various state specific selfstorage statutes and violations of various consumer fraud acts as a result of these litigation matters the company recorded a liability of 850 during the year ended december 31 2014 which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  although there can be no assurance the company is not aware of any material environmental liability for which it believes it will be ultimately responsible that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations however changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations the uses and conditions of properties in the vicinity of the companys properties the activities of its tenants and other environmental conditions of which the company is unaware with
