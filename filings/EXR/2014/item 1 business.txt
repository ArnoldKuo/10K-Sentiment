offer monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use selfstorage offers a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet properties generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed   selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a selfstorage property is determined by a propertys local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that residential tenants place in selfstorage properties range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods   our research has shown that tenants choose a selfstorage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for selfstorage properties a propertys perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals although most selfstorage properties are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time   the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march   since inception in the early 1970s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth according to the selfstorage almanac the almanac in 2003 there were only 37011 selfstorage properties in the united states with an average physical occupancy rate of 861 of net rentable square feet compared to 48151 selfstorage properties in 2013 with an average physical occupancy rate of 878 of net rentable square feet  4      table of contents  we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire properties especially for brokered portfolios aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this competition will likely continue   the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states owned approximately 122 of total us selfstorage properties and the top 50 selfstorage companies owned approximately 159 of the total us properties as of december 31 2013 we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future we also believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions given our
