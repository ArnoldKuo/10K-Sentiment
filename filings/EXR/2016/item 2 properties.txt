  as of december 31 2015 we owned or had ownership interests in 999 operating stores of these stores 746 are whollyowned and 253 are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 348 stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which we own andor manage to 1347 these stores are located in 36 states washington dc and puerto rico we receive a management fee generally equal to approximately 60 of cash collected from total revenues to manage the joint venture and third party sites as of december 31 2015 we owned andor managed approximately 101 million square feet of rentable space configured in approximately 896000 separate storage units approximately 70 of our stores are clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics for stores the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence  we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years    20    table of contents as of december 31 2015 approximately 800000 tenants were leasing storage units at the 1347 operating stores that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time for stores that were stabilized as of december 31 2015 the average length of stay was approximately 137 months  the average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized stores net of discounts and bad debt was 1483 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 1402 for the year ended december 31 2014 average annual rent per square foot for new leases was 1541 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 1435 for the year ended december 31 2014 the average discounts as a percentage of rental revenues during these periods were 33 and 38 respectively  our store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located most often sites are what we consider hybrid facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only  the following table presents additional information regarding the occupancy of our stabilized stores by state as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the information as of december 31 2014 is on a pro forma basis as though all the stores owned at december 31 2015 were under
