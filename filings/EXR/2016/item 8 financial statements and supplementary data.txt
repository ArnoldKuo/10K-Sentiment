operations  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report we make statements in this section that are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws for a complete discussion of forwardlooking statements see the section in this form 10k entitled statements regarding forwardlooking information certain risk factors may cause actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion for a discussion of such risk factors see the section in this form 10k entitled risk factors amounts in thousands except share and per share data  overview  we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by extra space storage llc and its subsidiaries to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed stores  at december 31 2015 we owned had ownership interests in or managed 1347 operating stores in 36 states washington dc and puerto rico of these 1347 operating stores we owned 746 we held joint venture interests in 253 stores and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 348 stores that are owned by third parties these operating stores contain approximately 101 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 896000 units and currently serve a customer base of approximately 800000 tenants  our stores are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization a store is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years  to maximize the performance of our stores we employ industryleading revenue management systems developed by our management team these systems enable us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues  we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under leases at each of our whollyowned stores from management fees on the stores we manage for jointventure partners and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program our management fee is generally equal to approximately 60 of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed stores we also receive an asset management fee of 05 of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures  we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our store results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industryleading technology systems    29    table of contents we continue to evaluate a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following           maximize the performance of our stores through strategic efficient and proactive management we pursue revenuegenerating and expenseminimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost           acquire stores our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multistore portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals we continue to see available acquisitions on which to bid and are seeing increasing prices however we remain a disciplined buyer and look for acquisitions that will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value           expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint we believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores  critical accounting policies and estimates  our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies  consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities vies an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie  a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entitys equity holders as a group either a lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest or combination of variable interests that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie  we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the    30    table of contents  obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements as of december 31 2015 we had no consolidated vies additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated  real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized  expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between 5 and 39 years  in connection with our acquisition of stores the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings is determined as if vacant intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transaction costs are expensed as incurred  intangible lease rights include 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on three stores that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on six stores where the ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms  evaluation of asset impairment long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on stores where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these stores we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we review stores in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections  when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred we compare the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets  when real estate assets are identified as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets net of selling costs if the estimated fair value net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets we would recognize a loss on the disposal group classified as held for sale the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations for all periods presented    31    table of contents investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements  under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint ventures sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity  our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment using significant unobservable inputs is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment  derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges  for derivatives designated as fair value hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings  revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the leases promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period late charges administrative fees merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities interest income is recognized as earned  property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected  tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage we record an unpaid claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history the unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end including both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported we use a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received the administrator evaluates each claim to determine the ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported annually a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid    32    table of contents  claims liability prior year claim reserves are adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known the impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations the unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value each tenant chooses the amount of insurance coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program tenants can purchase policies in amounts of two thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars of insurance coverage in exchange for a monthly fee our exposure per claim is limited by the maximum amount of coverage chosen by each tenant we purchase reinsurance for losses exceeding a set amount on any one event we do not currently have any amounts recoverable under the reinsurance arrangements  income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex if we were to fail to meet these requirements we would be subject to federal income tax we are subject to certain state and local taxes provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations  we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred  recent accounting pronouncements  in april 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201408 presentation of financial statements topic 205 and property plant and equipment topic 360 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity under this guidance only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations the guidance also requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation the company adopted this guidance effective january 1 2015 we have not previously had discontinued operations and as such this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous industryspecific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the international financial reporting standards asu 201409 outlines a fivestep process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards the amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers asu 201409 was originally effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption in july 2015 the fasb approved a oneyear deferral of the effective date of the standard the new standard will now become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption on the original effective date permitted the company has not yet selected a transition method management is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of asu 201409 on our consolidated financial statements  in february 2015 the fasb issued asu 201502 consolidation topic 810 amendments to the consolidation analysis this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 including interim periods within that reporting period asu 201502 amends the criteria for determining if    33    table of contents  a service provider possesses a variable interest in a variable interest entity vie and eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership we do not expect the adoption of this standard to materially impact its consolidated financial statements  in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503 interestimputation of interest simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability the new guidance only impacts financial statement presentation the guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2016 and allows for early adoption we adopted this guidance october 1 2015 on a retrospective basis as a result 20120 of unamortized debt issuance costs that had been included in the other assets line on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2014 are now presented as direct deductions from the carrying amounts of the related debt liabilities  in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201505 intangiblesgoodwill and otherinternaluse software subtopic 35040customers accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement which provides guidance regarding the accounting for fees paid by a customer in cloud computing arrangements if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license the payment of fees should be accounted for in the same manner as the acquisition of other software licenses if there is no software license the fees should be accounted for as a service contract the guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 and early adoption is permitted an entity can elect to adopt the amendments either 1 prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or 2 retrospectively we do not expect the adoption of this standard to materially impact our consolidated financial statements  in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201515 interestimputation of interest subtopic 83530 presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lineofcredit arrangements which provides guidance regarding the classification of debt issuance costs associated with lines of credit specifically deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the lineofcredit arrangement is allowed we adopted this guidance effective october 1 2015 we continued to present the debt issuance costs and related accumulated amortization relating to our lines of credit as assets  results of operations  comparison of the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2014  overview  results for the year ended december 31 2015 included the

relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc nareit as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements  the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions  the following

limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions we will consider factors including but not limited to           the interest rate of the proposed financing           the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our stores           prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing           the purchase price of stores acquired with debt financing

may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing stores for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable  we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt as well as

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates  interest rate risk  interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control  as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 36 billion in total face value debt of which approximately 11 billion was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 73 million annually  interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure    48    table of contents   item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  extra space storage inc  index to consolidated financial statements  and

accrual basis of accounting in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and include the accounts of the company and its wholly or majorityowned subsidiaries all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation  variable interest entities  the company accounts for arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights as variable interest entities vies an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entitys equity holders as a group either a lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest or combination of variable interests that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie    58    table of contents the company has concluded that under certain circumstances when the company enters into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created the company has performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with the companys financial statements additionally the operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated  the companys investments in real estate joint ventures where the company has significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which the company is not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements  use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates  fair value disclosures  derivative financial instruments  currently the company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts the variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate forward curves  the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements in adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk the company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings thresholds mutual puts and guarantees in conjunction with the financial accounting standard boards fair value measurement guidance the company made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio  although the company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize level 3 inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties however as of december 31 2015 the company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives as a result the company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy    59    table of contents the table below presents the companys assets and liabilities measured

         there were no transfers of assets and liabilities between level 1 and level 2 during the year ended december 31 2015 the company did not have any significant assets or liabilities that are remeasured on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs as of december 31 2015 or 2014  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  longlived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment the company reviews each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist the company focuses on stores where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these stores the company determines whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition the company reviews stores in the leaseup stage and compares actual operating results to original projections  when the company determines that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred the company compares the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets  when real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale the company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value of the assets net of selling costs if the estimated fair value net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets the company would recognize a loss on the disposal group classified as held for sale the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations for all periods presented as of december 31 2015 the company had seven stores classified as held for sale the estimated fair value less selling costs of each of these assets is greater than the carrying value of the assets and therefore no loss has been recorded  the company assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the companys investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired annually and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment  as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis    60    table of contents fair value of financial instruments  the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents restricted cash receivables other financial instruments included

cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized the construction period begins when expenditures for the real estate assets have been made and activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use are in progress the construction period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use  expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between five and 39 years  in connection with the companys acquisition of stores the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings is determined as if vacant intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases the company measures the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on the companys historical experience with turnover in its stores debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transaction costs are expensed as incurred    61    table of contents intangible lease rights represent 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on three stores that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the life of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on six stores where the leases were assumed by the company at rates that were lower than the current market rates for similar leases the values associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms  investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures  the companys investments in real estate joint ventures where the company has significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which the company is not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  under the equity method the companys investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for the companys share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on the companys ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows the company follows the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint ventures sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity  cash and cash equivalents  the companys cash is deposited with financial institutions located throughout the united states and at times may exceed federally insured limits the company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents  restricted cash  restricted cash is comprised of letters of credit and escrowed funds deposited with financial institutions located throughout the united states relating to earnest money deposits on potential acquisitions real estate taxes insurance and capital expenditures  other assets  other assets consist primarily of equipment and fixtures customer accounts receivable investments in trusts notes receivable other intangible assets income taxes receivable deferred tax assets prepaid expenses and the fair value of interest rate swaps depreciation of equipment and fixtures is computed on a straightline basis over three to five years  derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative whether the company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk such as interest rate risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged    62    table of contents  forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge the company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain

financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio  risk management and use of financial instruments  in the normal course of its ongoing business operations the company encounters economic risk there are three main components of economic risk interest rate risk credit risk and market risk the company is subject to interest rate risk on its interestbearing liabilities credit risk is the risk of inability or unwillingness of tenants to make contractually required payments market risk is the risk of declines in the value of stores due to changes in rental rates interest rates or other market factors affecting the value of stores held by the company the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of its interest rate risk  exchange of common operating partnership units  redemption of common operating partnership units for shares of common stock when redeemed under the original provisions of the operating partnership agreement are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from noncontrolling interest to the companys equity  revenue and expense recognition  rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the leases promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period late charges administrative fees merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized as income when earned management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities interest income is recognized as earned  property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred the company accrues for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected  tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage the company records an unpaid claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history the unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end including both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported the company uses a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received the administrator evaluates each claim to determine the ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported annually a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid claims liability prior year claim reserves are adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known the impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations the unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value each tenant chooses the amount of insurance coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program tenants can purchase policies in amounts of two thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars of insurance coverage in exchange for a monthly fee as of december 31 2015 the average insurance coverage for tenants was approximately two thousand six hundred dollars the companys exposure per claim is limited by the maximum amount of coverage chosen by each    63    table of contents  tenant the company purchases reinsurance for losses exceeding a set amount for any one event the company does not currently have any amounts recoverable under the reinsurance arrangements  real estate sales  in general sales of real estate and related profitslosses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and

shares that were dilutive and outstanding during the period the denominator includes the weighted average number of basic shares and the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares that were dilutive had been issued and is calculated using either the twoclass treasury stock or as ifconverted method whichever is most dilutive potential common shares are securities such as options convertible debt series a participating redeemable preferred units series a units series b redeemable preferred units series b units series c convertible

of the company but could do so in the future by virtue of their option redemption or conversion right  in computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities net income is adjusted to add back any changes in earnings in the period associated with the convertible security the numerator also is adjusted for the effects of any other nondiscretionary changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per common share only potential common shares that are dilutive those that reduce earnings per common share are

variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities the company manages economic risks including interest rate liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount sources and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments specifically the company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts the value of which are determined by interest rates the companys derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount timing and duration of the companys known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the companys investments and borrowings  cash flow hedges of interest rate risk  the companys objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements to accomplish this objective the company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the company making fixedrate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income oci and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings a portion of these changes is excluded from accumulated other comprehensive income as it is allocated to noncontrolling interests during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variablerate debt during 2016 the

the company is involved in various legal proceedings and is subject to various claims and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business because litigation is inherently unpredictable the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty in accordance with applicable accounting guidance management establishes an accrued liability for litigation when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable in such cases there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued the estimated loss if any is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties therefore any estimates of loss disclosed below represents what management believes to be an estimate of loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria and does not represent our maximum loss exposure the company could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in any particular period notwithstanding the fact that the company is currently vigorously defending any legal proceedings against it  the company currently has several legal proceedings pending against it that include causes of action alleging wrongful foreclosure violations of various state specific selfstorage statutes and violations of various consumer fraud acts as a result of these litigation matters the company recorded a liability of 850 during the year ended december 31 2014 which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  although there can be no assurance the company is not aware of any material environmental liability for which it believes it will be ultimately responsible that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations however changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations the uses and conditions of properties in the vicinity of the companys properties the activities of its tenants and other environmental conditions of which the company is unaware with respect to its properties could result in future material environmental liabilities    97    table of contents   23 supplementary quarterly financial data unaudited                            for the
