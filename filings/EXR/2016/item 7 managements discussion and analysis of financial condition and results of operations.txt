discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report we make statements in this section that are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws for a complete discussion of forwardlooking statements see the

implied by the following discussion for a discussion of such risk factors see the section in this form 10k entitled risk factors amounts in thousands except share and per share data  overview  we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by extra space storage llc and its subsidiaries to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed stores  at december 31 2015 we owned had ownership interests in or managed 1347 operating stores in 36 states washington dc and puerto rico of these 1347 operating stores we owned 746 we held joint venture interests in 253 stores and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 348 stores that are owned by third parties these operating stores contain approximately 101 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 896000 units and currently serve a customer base of approximately 800000 tenants  our stores are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization a store is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years  to maximize the performance of our stores we employ industryleading revenue management systems developed by our management team these systems enable us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues  we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under leases at each of our whollyowned stores from management fees on the stores we manage for jointventure partners and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program our management fee is generally equal to approximately 60 of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed stores we also receive an asset management fee of 05 of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures  we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our store results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industryleading technology systems    29    table of contents we continue to evaluate a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following           maximize the performance of our stores through strategic efficient and proactive management we pursue revenuegenerating and expenseminimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost           acquire stores our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multistore portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals we continue to see available acquisitions on which to bid and are seeing increasing prices however we remain a disciplined buyer and look for acquisitions that will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value           expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint we believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores  critical accounting policies and estimates  our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies  consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities vies an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie  a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entitys equity holders as a group either a lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest or combination of variable interests that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie  we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the    30    table of contents  obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements as of december 31 2015 we had no consolidated vies additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated  real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized  expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between 5 and 39 years  in connection with our acquisition of stores the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings is determined as if vacant intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transaction costs are expensed as incurred  intangible lease rights include 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on three stores that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on six stores where the ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms  evaluation of asset impairment long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on stores where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these stores we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we review stores in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections  when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred we compare the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets  when real estate assets are identified as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets net of selling costs if the estimated fair value net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets we would recognize a loss on the disposal group classified as held for sale the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations for all periods presented    31    table of contents investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements  under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint ventures sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity  our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment using significant unobservable inputs is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment  derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges  for derivatives designated as fair value hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings  revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the leases promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period late charges administrative fees merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities interest income is recognized as earned  property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected  tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage we record an unpaid claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history the unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end including both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported we use a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received the administrator evaluates each claim to determine the ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported annually a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid    32    table of contents  claims liability prior year claim reserves are adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known the impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations the unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value each tenant chooses the amount of insurance coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program tenants can purchase policies in amounts of two thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars of insurance coverage in exchange for a monthly fee our exposure per claim is limited by the maximum amount of coverage chosen by each tenant we purchase reinsurance for losses exceeding a set amount on any one event we do not currently have any amounts recoverable under the reinsurance arrangements  income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex if we were to fail to meet these requirements we would be subject to federal income tax we are subject to certain state and local taxes provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations  we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred  recent accounting pronouncements  in april 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201408 presentation of financial statements topic 205 and property plant and equipment topic 360 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity under this guidance only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations the guidance also requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation the company adopted this guidance effective january 1 2015 we have not previously had discontinued operations and as such this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous industryspecific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the international financial reporting standards asu 201409 outlines a fivestep process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards the amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers asu 201409 was originally effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption in july 2015 the fasb approved a oneyear deferral of the effective date of the standard the new standard will now become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption on the original effective date permitted the company has not yet selected a transition method management is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of asu 201409 on our consolidated financial statements  in february 2015 the fasb issued asu 201502 consolidation topic 810 amendments to the consolidation analysis this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 including interim periods within that reporting period asu 201502 amends the criteria for determining if    33    table of contents  a service provider possesses a variable interest in a variable interest entity vie and eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership we do not expect the adoption of this standard to materially impact its consolidated financial statements  in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503 interestimputation of interest simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability the new guidance only impacts financial statement presentation the guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2016 and allows for early adoption we adopted this guidance october 1 2015 on a retrospective basis as a result 20120 of unamortized debt issuance costs that had been included in the other assets line on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2014 are now presented as direct deductions from the carrying amounts of the related debt liabilities  in

regarding the accounting for fees paid by a customer in cloud computing arrangements if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license the payment of fees should be accounted for in the same manner as the acquisition of other software licenses if there is no software license the fees should be accounted for as a service contract the guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 and early adoption is permitted an entity can elect to adopt the amendments either 1 prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or 2 retrospectively we do not expect the adoption of this standard to materially impact our consolidated financial statements  in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201515 interestimputation of

separate joint ventures with affiliates of grupe prior to the acquisition we accounted for our interests in these joint ventures as equitymethod investments we recognized a noncash gain of 3438 during

 funds from operations  ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc nareit as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements  the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions  the following table presents the calculation of ffo for the periods indicated                        for the year endeddecember 31        2015     2014     2013
